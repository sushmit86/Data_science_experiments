electrokinetics promises to be the microfluidic technique of choice for portable diagnostic chips and for nanofluidic molecular detectors however despite two centuries of research our understanding of ion transport and electro osmotic flow in and near nanoporous membranes whose pores are natural nanochannels remains woefully inadequate this short exposition reviews the various ion flux and hydrodynamic anomalies and speculates on their potential applications particularly in the area of molecular sensing in the process we revisit several old disciplines with some unsolved open questions and we hope to create new one there is considerable interest in synthesizing nanoporous membranes on microfluidic chips and fabricating nanochannels directly into chips within our group we have used nanoporous membranes as microfilters for removing debris or concentrating analytes as substrates for electrokinetic pumps and electrospray emitters into mass spectrometers and as effective chromatograph packing the membranes typically have high surface charge density of about one charge per nm and when their pore dimension is smaller than the electric debye layer edl thickness e there exists strong edl overlap these membranes become ion selective such that mostly counterions can enter and exit the membrane as the usual debye screening is much weaker within their nanopores for the same reason the permselective membranes allow high surface adsorption rate of chemical and biological analytes these desirable features of nanoporous membranes are extensively exploited in desalination chromatography virus traps etc and have found similar applications in chip scale analogs of the same processes electrochemical sensing of molecular hybridization is rather peculiar form of ion selective current transport with the electron transfer oxidation and reduction reaction occurring at the electrode providing the ion selectivity although nanochannel or nanopore is absent in this system the ion flux across the electrode debye layer is very similar to that across the interface between the nanochannel and the microreservoir since both systems exhibit ion permselectivity the flux in that region will be shown to be current controlling for both systems there are however unique microfluidic applications of nanoporous membranes that are not scaled down versions of large scale processes the nanopores contain more space charge per unit volume than microchannels as such nanopores generate high maxwell pressure per unit volume when an electric field is applied thus allowing the realization of high pressure atm microcapillary electrokinetic pump using streaming potential to generate electricity is also best done with nanoporous membrane for precisely the same reason the same filtering concentrating and flow generating ability of nanoporous membranes can now be mimicked by fabricated nanochannels which can be easier to introduce onto chips and whose geometry and surface functionalization are easier to modify than nanoporous membranes there are also suggestions of using nanochannel as an electrochemical molecular sensor much like what is done with electrode sensors but with larger selectivity and sensitivity transparent chips allow us to monitor the ion and liquid flux within the channel with uncharged and charged dye as such fabricated nanochannels allow us to explore the ion flux mechanism within nanoporous materials with some important caveats that will be addressed in this article despite these obvious advantages of nanoporous membranes and nanochannels in electrokinetic chips ionic and solvent fluxes current and hydrodynamics in such media remain poorly understood we review some anomalous features here and propose fruitful research directions that will allow nano electrokinetics to blossom into robust technology for diagnostic and biosensor science nonlinear v the ion flux mechanism across nanoporous membrane has been known to produce anomalous ion current dynamics for more than century such anomalous behavior is not just due to faradaic or ion exchange reaction within the membrane and actually spurred forays into irreversible thermodynamics years ago even standard ion selective transport across the nanoporous membrane can exhibit extremely complex steady and dynamic phenomena nanoporous membranes are known to store charge because of the conductivity jump at the membrane surface to produce streaming potentials electroviscous effects nonlinear v characteristics and oscillatory instabilities unlike polarized capacitors such charge buildup can be sustained with dc field and allows through current hence it endows the nanoporous membrane with dc v and ac impedance characteristics that cannot be understood through standard electric elements such as resistors capacitors and inductors not surprisingly ion channels of cell membranes also exhibit such curious characteristics that are often described as nonlinear resistor elements many of these anomalies are now transferred to nanochannels but with important modifications the underlying physics of these anomalies unfortunately remain poorly understood despite two centuries of intensive research examples of such anomalies abound figure depicts the v characteristic across pyrex glass polysilicon nanoslit described schematically in the inset the nanoslit behaves as linear ohmic resistor at high ionic strength when the channel gap is larger than the debye length however it is clearly non ohmic at low concentrations wherein edls of both substrates overlap as it exhibits three distinct regions of constant differential resistance showing voltage gating like nonlinear circuit behavior an ohmic region at low voltages is followed by nearly constant current limiting region and then an overlimiting region with conductance higher than even the ohmic region as another example we show in fig the cyclic voltametry of similar nanoslit to that described in fig considerable hysteretic behavior is observed and the hysteresis is strong function of the scan rate the hysteretic phenomenon occurs despite the fact that there is no discernable reaction within the membrane figure shows the ac impedance measurements across the nanoslit at different dc biases with very chaotic noise at low frequencies at high biases even without faradaic or ion exchange reaction the dc and ac ion transport characteristics across the nanoslit are very different from simple resistor or resistor capacitor system these nonlinear v and capacitance charging characteristics are also found across cell membranes driven by the potential drop across the membrane due to difference in the ionic strength the nonlinear v characteristics of cells however are due mostly to voltage gating effects of ion channel protein at subnanoscales nevertheless the conductivity gradient across cells can also accumulate charge at its interface to produce cell polarization and dipoles an empirical fact that has been exploited to sort cells by dep on chips the nonlinear v and capacitance charging features of the cell are used for neuron signal transmission activating and controlling growth factor receptor binding and regulating the pathways of many messenger molecules across the membrane it is our belief that the same nonlinear characteristics in nanochannels and nanoporous membranes will introduce new impedance molecular detection strategies particularly those for the detection of charged molecules like peptides rna and dna intrachannel ohmic some of the relevant ion transport physics behind the curious v characteristics are understood the conductance in the ohmic region of fig is due almost entirely to intrananochannel resistance this is clear departure from nanoporous membrane whose conductivity is typically assumed to be high and hence offers no resistance to ion current however in nanochannel design like fig the cross section area of the nanochannel is much smaller than that in the connecting microchannel its ratio is much smaller than the typical porosity of the nanoporous membrane or the power of it to produce the void cross section area ratio the length of the nanochannel is also comparable to the microchannel whereas membrane is typically much thinner than the electrode separation as result even with higher conductivity within the nanochannel these geometric effects render the conductance of the nanochannel much smaller than the bulk and hence become the bottleneck to ion current while the idealized ohmic conditions in the bulk correspond to an electroneutral electrolyte with no concentration gradient the intrachannel ohmic resistance is due to mobile ions of the charged electrolyte within the slit stein et al first realized that at low ionic strengths the dc conductance of the nanochannel essentially the conductance measured across the electrodes at the ends of the microchannel is independent of the bulk electrolyte concentration under such ionic strengths the double layers on the top and bottom substrates of the nanochannel overlap such that most of the ions in it are counterions as the nanochannel unit at relatively low voltages wherein intrachannel polarization is negligible must be electroneutral the total number of counterions must be equal to the total constant surface charge and is independent of the bulk ionic strength as the channel conductivity is proportional to the total ions within the nanochannel and as most of the ions are counterions the conductance is independent of bulk electrolyte conditions simple algebra for the ion concentrations within the nanochannel which has boltzmann dependence on the potential then produces the donnan relationship between the nanochannel conductance and the bulk electrolyte concentration assuming for simplicity symmetric electrolyte z and equal diffusivities d i f zi ici wh f wh where is the bulk concentration is the width of the channel is the the height is the length zf zfd rt is the ion mobility denotes the faraday number is the universal gas constant is the absolute temperature and zfh wherein is the surface charged density is the effective fixed volumetric charge in the limit of low bulk concentration the debye layers overlap across the nanochannel such that it contains mostly counterions the electroneutrality condition then stipulates that the total number of counterions responsible for the conductance is equal to the total surface charge this independent limit is evident in eq and so is the high limit when the conductivity approaches that of the bulk and hence increases linearly with the unknown surface charge density can be fitted by the low ionic strength asymptote this is done in fig for the low voltage ohmic regions of fig reasonable surface charge density of mc for pyrex glass polysilicon combination is found to quantitatively capture the channel conductance for all electrolyte conditions at high conductivities there is no ion selectivity within the nanoslit as its double layers do not overlap as such the electrolyte within the nanochannel is mostly electroneutral and equal in concentration to the bulk electrolyte intrachannel resistance also controls the current flux due to field focusing as is true for all electroneutral and spatially homogeneous electrolyte systems the v characteristics of the nanoslit at high conductivities are hence ohmic with linear dependence between current and voltage the ionic strength within the nanoslit begins to deviate from the bulk conditions at low bulk concentrations fig and the fluid within the nanoslit exhibits net ionic charge due to ion selectivity nevertheless at sufficiently low voltages the nanoslit and the bulk conductivities remain homogeneous in the flux direction and they can still be modeled as two resistors in series with the intraslit resistance dominating in most cases due to field focusing effects non ohmic resistance in the classical membrane current theories the ohmic region is believed to terminate at sufficiently high voltage when the current density approaches near constant limiting current value seen in the intermediate voltage region of fig due to electrostatic attraction between surface charges and counterions in the membrane the membrane is locally electroneutral at least at low voltages when there is no internal polarization consequently an intramembrane spatial gradient in the counterion concentration cannot be established at low voltages this is not true however in the bulk and diffusion due to concentration gradient can augment electromigration in the electroneutral bulk this region with large concentration gradient remains electroneutral due to the strong attraction between the counterions and coions it is just that neither is immobilized and hence required to be spatially homogeneous strong concentration gradient is known to exist at least in some part of the bulk electrolyte this diffusion layer where the concentration gradient exists can be the entire bulk region between the membrane and the electrode or it can be over small region near the membrane because of convection and stirring effects however the concentration gradient can reduce the electrolyte concentration near the membrane surface and hence reduce the bulk conductivity at low voltages the bulk concentration gradient is not pronounced as bulk electromigration is sufficient to sustain counterion flux to the rate limiting intramembrane conduction which is responsible for the ohmic region at low voltages in fig the concentration gradient becomes more pronounced at higher voltages and begins to reduce the electrolyte conductivity near the membrane thus shifting the current controlling region from the membrane to the bulk in fact ben and chang showed that any electroneutral diffusion layer with linear concentration profile also sustains potential drop that is the logarithm of the concentration drop across it which is due to the fact that the coion is at boltzmann equilibrium hence larger voltage does not necessarily drive more current as the potential drop is used to sustain an equilibrium concentration gradient and not an open ion flux the differential conductivity begins to decrease from the ohmic value as seen in fig at when ion transport starts to be controlled by this diffusion layer as the interfacial concentration of the diffusion layer approaches zero according to levich theory the limiting current occurs when the ion concentration at the membrane electrolyte interface approaches zero such that the ion flux cannot be increased beyond that at this limit simple analysis of the diffusion layer shows that the electromigration flux is equal to the diffusive flux and hence levich limiting current density is simply fzdc where is the thickness of the diffusion layer near the limiting current region it is the diffusion layer that controls the current and voltage drop and not the nanoslit which controls in the ohmic region there is no known analog of this diffusion layer in electric circuits as the diffusivity of electrons or holes is typically too high to allow an electroneutral concentration gradient to be established this diffusion layer endowed limiting current phenomenon would hence be one of the anomalous current flux phenomena of nanoporous membranes as viewed from the perspective of electric circuit theory there are however several empirical contradictions and conceptual inconsistencies with this theory it is the differential resistance that is observed to approach another high constant asymptote beyond the ohmic region rather than the current density as seen in fig levich theory does not offer theory for the thickness of this diffusion layer some have attributed it to the usual convection diffusion boundary layer in the presence of vigorous stirring or external flow however with stagnant fluids in the microchannel it is most likely that the diffusion layer spans the entire region between the membrane and the electrode if so why does third overlimiting region exists at high voltage with differential conductance much higher than any other region at lower voltages fig there is clearly yet another mechanism at play that selects the diffusion layer thickness which is unique to nanoporous membranes rubinstein and shtilman were the first to suggest that ion flux into the nanoporous membrane can not be enhanced by the development of diffusion layer alone necessitates also the emergence of an extended polarized layer another deviation from the electroneutral ohmic condition this polarized layer resides within the concentration polarization layer between the thin debye layer and the electroneutral diffusion layer with linear concentration profile and contains space charge due to net excess of counterions this existence of net charged layer on the depleted side of the membrane amplifies the applied electric field and drives large electromigrative flux that together with the large concentration gradient within the electroneutral diffusion layer prevents the current density from saturating at levich limiting current density the charged layer is not at boltzmann equilibrium and unlike that in the diffusion layer its potential drop drives net flux it also diminishes the diffusion layer thickness and hence increases the flux across the rate limiting diffusion layer the same polarization and concentration depletion that amplifies the electric field at the entrance of the nanoslit also renders the intrachannel resistance insignificant and the bottleneck to ion flux occurs at the polarized layer hence levich limiting current density theory is not strictly correct the extended polarized layer increases in length with voltage and so does the current density instead of limiting current density one has limiting differential conductance or impedance in this intermediate region an extended polarized layer with space charge that nevertheless sustains through current flux has no analog in electric circuit theory not even leaky dielectric models that allow surface currents this is yet another departure for ion flux across nanoporous membranes from conventional circuit elements for electrons or holes the structure of this extended polarized layer is now well characterized and we show in fig typical structure in the overlimiting region from ben and chang for given diffusion layer thickness nevertheless since the polarized layer is in series with the electroneutral diffusion layer the current flux across both should be the same it is then curious that the overlimiting region has an almost discontinuous differential conductance from that in the intermediate limiting resistance region rubinstein et al suggested that the diffusion layer thickness in the overlimiting region is much smaller than the distance to the electrode which is the diffusion layer for the ohmic and limiting resistance regions because of vortex instability this would explain why the overlimiting differential resistance can be the lowest of all three regions it has the benefit of very thin diffusion layer and correspondingly thin polarized layer none of which is present in the ohmic region the space charge layer on the outside of the membrane nanochannel becomes unstable only beyond another critical voltage larger than that for the emergence of the polarized layer when transition from the ohmic to the limiting resistance regions occurs when lateral variations in the maxwell pressure gradient produce vortical flow that convects electroneutral bulk solution into regions with larger polarization and hence higher osmotic pressures thus reducing the diffusion layer further to effect positive feedback loop fig that critical voltage which depends on the microchannel dimensions exists is because flow resistance in microchannel necessitates critical driving force for the vortical flow as in classical rayleigh benard instabilities within slot we have recently verified this scenario by rubinstein and co workers using fluorescent dye and confocal imaging to observe the depletion layer as shown in the images of fig with parallel current measurements similar to fig the overlimiting current is only detected beyond critical voltage when the vortices also appear the dc v characteristics of nanoporous membrane is hence sensitively affected by hydrodynamics another feature absent in electric elements this hydrodynamic enhanced instability produces the voltage gating type v characteristic of fig since the polarized layer appears only beyond critical voltage and the vortex instability onset is controlled by an overvoltage the high current density of the latter occurs only beyond second critical voltage the vortices act as gating electrode to enhance the ion flux across the channel there is some confusion between rubinstein vortex instability and dukhin vortices generated by curved or composite interfaces both involve the extended polarized layer outside conducting nanoporous membranes however rubinstein vortices originate from an internal instability and can develop even for planar interface beyond critical voltage dukhin vortices however rely on the polarization gradient on curved surface typically an ion exchange granule or heterogeneous membrane and occur for any voltage beyond the first critical voltage for the emergence of the extended polarized layer in contrast to rubinstein instability onset which necessitates an overvoltage e occurs only beyond the second critical voltage rubinstein vortices appear in an array and have dimensions comparable to the diffusion layer they in fact arrest the growth of the diffusion layer and stipulate its thickness dukhin vortices on the other hand reflect the heterogeneity length scale and the radius of curvature of the surface and have only an indirect influence on the diffusion layer via its stirring it is quite clear from the different voltage windows in fig with different differential resistance in each region that the nonlinear v characteristics of nanochannel or nanoporous membrane is due to rubinstein vortex instability the considerable voltage drop across the polarized layer controls the v characteristics in the overlimiting region given diffusion layer thickness ben and chang and yossifon et al offer convenient estimate of the current density across the polarized layer in the absence of convection for an ideal and nonideal permselective membrane respectively the theory however still needs to be extended to the case with vortical convection in the overlimiting region to determine how the vortices select the diffusion layer thickness from the concentration polarization layer structure of fig clear electroneutral diffusion region with linear concentration profile is evident beyond the extended polarized layer this diffusion layer is not necessarily established by tangential electro osmotic eo or convection flow instead it can extend to the electrode or be selected by the vortex instability the relaxation time of this concentration front in the electroneutral diffusion layer is much longer than that in the polarized layer as such the dominant dynamics probed by impedance measurements at frequencies lower than hz correspond to the dynamics of this electroneutral diffusion front for symmetric electrolyte one can eliminate the electromigration term by adding the cation and anion transport equations to produce diffusion equation for the ion concentration another equation corresponding to net charge transport obtained by subtracting the anion transport equation from the cation equation can be coupled to the diffusion equation to replace the two ion transport equations however for an electroneutral front the second charge transport equation is irrelevant and the diffusion equation hence governs the dynamics leading to the linear concentration profile in the diffusion layer for constant counterion sink at the interface mimics the cation permselective influx into the membrane which was activated at time zero the diffusion front from the diffusion equation is governed by x c d e dt xd erf dt in the limit of large dt this solution simplifies to x c st x x dt while the self similar diffusive front has concentration jump that is dependent on the flux the location of its front grows as dt independent of provided the flux is varied slowly this self similar front evolution dynamics stipulates that the thickness of the diffusive front is well described by the simple and universal diffusive scaling dt independent of the frequency and the instantaneous or rms electric field we have monitored the front location of the fluorescent counterion dye with low frequency ac field and were able to verify this diffusive front dynamics where the front breaks from the dt scaling for frequencies hz fig correspond to the onset of fully established vortices that are capable of arresting the diffusion layer growth this diffusive dynamics also occurs at high frequency and low voltages when there is very little polarization when the period is much shorter than the charging time of the polarized layer at this low voltage after fourier transform the concentration assumes the form x c e xi where is the concentration at the nanochannel electrolyte interface if there is very little electromigration then the current at the surface is entirely diffusive and the inverse impedance assumes the characteristic warburg form with real and imaginary parts of the same amplitude at all frequencies favzd c favzd c where is the cross section area of the nanoslot this warburg impedance is observed across many electrodes and its phase is also observed in fig at intermediate frequencies due to counterion diffusion fronts from the nanoslit the impedance spectrum is however very different at low frequencies and high voltage biases as seen in fig the lower applied voltages during the impedance measurement may not be able to sustain stable vortex but it can produce fluctuating transient vortices similar chaotic current fluctuations at hydrodynamic time scales have also been observed in ehlert and co workers experiments across nanoporous granule that the extended polarized layer only appears on the entry side of the membrane but not on the other side produces yet another anomalous v characteristic current rectification which is reminiscent of that occurring in semiconductor bipolar diode in fig we depict the difference in the v curves when the polarity of the dc field is reversed for nanoslit with asymmetric entrances as the flux controlling polarized layer lies at opposite sides of the nanoslit with opposite polarity the asymmetry of the entrance produces significant current rectification result but only at high voltages beyond the critical voltage for the occurrence of the polarized layer earlier efforts to produce rectification at the low voltage ohmic region rely on inducing nonhomogenous electrochemical potential along the nanochannel by introducing asymmetries in the nanochannel geometry changing the channel height pore diameter e the edls overlap or surface functionalization realizing that the asymmetric entrance of the polarized layer controls the current at high voltages has allowed us to produce rectification by simply changing the lateral dimension e channel spacing at the two entrances while keeping its height and surface charge homogeneous or equivalently homogeneous electrochemical potential we note that the rectification effect disappears in the low voltage ohmic region when the polarized layer disappears this rectification phenomenon is very different from earlier ones for nanochannels with nonuniform channel height pore diameter or surface functionalization these earlier ones typically operate in the ohmic region and rely on internal diodelike rachet dynamics that most likely disappear at reasonably high throughputs here the rectification results because the polarized layer only appears at the side where the counterions enter since the vortex instability that controls the overlimiting current occurs at critical voltage that depends on the depth of the microreservoir as the vortex instability involves length scale dependent viscous dissipation different microreservoir depth at the two sides of nanoslit with symmetric entrances would immediately introduce the rectification phenomenon at high voltages and throughputs as the polarized layer require some rc time to charge and discharge it is not surprising that the hysteretic v cycle of fig is scan rate dependent the particular hysteresis pattern and its relationship to the polarized layer formation and dissipation dynamics remains to be explored the capacitance estimated from the low frequency limit of the impedance spectrum in fig corresponds to the charging of the polarized layer at the entry surface since the polarized layer thickness is function of voltage and changes discontinuously when the vortex instability sets in this impedance signature should also be voltage dependent this nonlinear impedance characteristic also begs further examination all the curious ion flux characteristics here are observed without reaction an internal reaction that consumes the counterions is expected to reduce the current once the threshold voltage for the reaction is exceeded this may be fruitful research direction as diodelike negative differential resistance can produce nonlinear inductor type characteristics with diode the nanochannel resistance and the space charge accumulating polarized layer capacitor can mimic many of the ion channel electrophysiological dynamics including unforced autonomous oscillations if the dominant current carrying counterions are being consumed by reaction at an electrode within the nanoslit such oscillation can give rise to very sensitive molecular sensors whose detection signal is an unmistakable autonomous oscillation thoughts in the same direction may also lead to viable interactive interface among biological systems nanofluidics and nanocircuitry both sensing and actuation are required for such an integrated system and sensing of rnas growth factors enzymes and other molecular messengers for the cell is particularly pertinent one has to be mindful of extrapolating multiplicatively the v characteristics of single channel to one with multiple channels or to nanoporous membrane in fig we show that an array of nanoslits produces current that is not an integer multiple of single channel the difference is believed to be caused by lateral communication among different polarized layers at the entry end while communication is expected between two nanopores in membrane this is not necessarily so for an array of nanochannels g by simply increasing the channel spacing this lack of channel communication could be exploited such that each channel can produce unique impedance signal that can be picked up by large electrode there would not be cross talk between the channels thus allowing multitarget sensing by for example patterning each nanochannel with different molecular probe another clear distinction between nanochannels and nanoporous membranes is the tortuosity of void space in the latter the counterion concentration is not uniform in nanoporous membane and there can be electroneutral pockets when the void dimension exceeds the debye layer thickness as result an osmotic pressure gradient exists along the field direction in nanoporous membrane such gradient is absent in nanochannel the same mechanisms that drive rubinstein instability and dukhin vortices can then produce internal closed vortices that reduce the void fraction for net electro osmotic flow as such hydrodynamic resistance in nanoporous membrane probably exceeds that in nanochannel by large magnitude one can get robust ion current without any liquid flow even for nanochannel there is large osmotic pressure gradient at the entrance that may introduce critical voltage for electro osmotic flow to design membrane that permits counterion flux but not electro osmotic flow which tends to convect coions as well is major design objective for permselective membranes selective filtration of charged molecules like proteins and dnas by nanochannels will likely also benefit from the reduction in net liquid flow ion flux without imparting body force on the liquid in membrane is classical example of irreversible thermodynamics and we may find ourselves revisiting this old field in the latest nanofluidic designs certainly large ion pumps on the cell membrane do not permit significant water flux related topic is multiphase flow in nanoporous membranes spinodal decomposition can occur in nanoslits due to surface charges or air pockets can exist in an otherwise wet medium in such cases the conductivity is controlled by the connectivity of the more conducting phase this conductivity in turn is determined by how the two phases coalesce and segregate under an electric field the texture and connectivity of the two phase media are expected to be strong function of the tortuosity and wettability of the medium we suspect the hysteretic behavior observed in fig is due to such two phase flow and segregation coalescence as mentioned in an earlier discussion on faradaic currents it would be interesting to combine such distinct voltage ringing and other nonlinear electrical properties of nanochannels with molecular sensing nanochannels can concentrate charged molecules and counterions molecular gating has already been achieved by molecular probes at the nanochannel in some preliminary experiments as in nanoporous beads for virus trapping as shown in our recent analysis of nanocolloid dielectrophoresis surface conduction becomes very important at nanoscales and surface conductance is known to be sensitive function of molecular hybridization if binding of such analytes with probes on the nanochannel surface can trigger potential oscillations due to the negative differential resistance and positive feedback of an imposed or intrinsic electrokinetic diode it would allow very sensitive detection in general although biological electrophysiology typically operates in the nonlinear region with voltage gating and negative resistance most impedance sensors still operate in the linear ohmic region electrochemical sensors for molecular binding in fact show extensive rectification and cyclic voltametric hysteresis across oxidation and reduction conditions other reversible faradaic reactions with double layer effects also show hysteretic behavior even without inverting the potential coupling of such faradaic nonlinear v responses to those of the nanochannel through some kind of ion faradaic reaction at an internal electrode should produce extremely sensitive detection of molecular hybridization even in the low voltage ohmic region the intrachannel conductance can be sensitive function of hybridization hybridization changes the active area of the nanochannel surface for electron transfer and surface conductance this in turn produces different warburg impedance signal in eq at high frequencies corresponding to the charge relaxation time at the entrance polarized layer as the classical warburg impedance theory omits space charge effects another fruitful integration would be with functionalized nanocolloids which can be dispersed into larger sample to capture target molecules and then sorted in large throughputs with combination of nanochannel array dep and microcross flow nanocolloids functionalized with molecular probes offer the advantage of being able to capture molecules in high throughput flow with short diffusion time of the molecule to the colloid however as the fraction of hybridized nanocolloids is small for high sensitivity detection the challenge is then to sort the hybridized colloids from their unhybridized counterparts this could be done by driving the hybridizing colloids in flowing solution transversely into nanochannels with higher fields as unlike unhybridized nanocolloids hybridized nanocolloids could exhibit positive dep at the proper frequency and hence favor the high field nanochannels charged nanocolloids behave like macroions but their significant volume and propensity to pack into colloid crystals in confined domains can produce nonlinear v and capacitance effects of their own when nanocolloids are trapped within nanochannels the coupling between nanochannel v characteristics and the field altering effects of packed nanocolloids may produce the most pronounced nonlinear v signals for nanocolloid capture in fig we show preliminary experiment in this direction nanocolloids are observed to assemble and disassemble periodically in nanochannel in conclusion we conjecture that the nonlinear v and impedance characteristics of nanochannels and nanoporous membranes reviewed in this expository will lead to new sensing paradigm in diagnostic chips for molecular detection with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity however to fully design such new sensing platform the underlying mechanisms must be fully understood  microfluidic devices allow for precise control of the cellular and noncellular microenvironment at physiologically relevant length and time scales these devices have been shown to mimic the complex in vivo microenvironment better than conventional in vitro assays and allow real time monitoring of homotypic or heterotypic cellular interactions microfluidic culture platforms enable new assay designs for culturing multiple different cell populations and or tissue specimens under controlled user defined conditions applications include fundamental studies of cell population behaviors high throughput drug screening and tissue engineering in this review we summarize recent developments in this field along with studies of heterotypic cell cell interactions and tissue specimen culture in microfluidic devices from our own laboratory cell cell interactions regulate organ function in both tissue homeostasis and disease by controlling basic cellular functions such as survival apoptosis migration proliferation and differentiation these interactions can be homotypic or heterotypic and depending on the intercellular distance can occur via multiple mechanisms such as direct physical contact diffusion of soluble paracrine factors electrical signal transmission and transduction of mechanical cues through the surrounding extracellular matrix ecm during tissue regeneration interactions between stem cells and other cell types within the niche environment are essential to preserve stem cell proliferative potential and multipotency cellular interactions among small groups of cells have also been shown to control oocyte polarization through cell cell receptor signaling during the developmental processes of body axes formation in drosophila in diseased tissues cell cell interactions may become perturbed and this is crucial not only for disease initiation g neurodegenerative disorders but also during later stages of disease progression g cancer metastasis in vitro culture platforms designed to model image and measure these interactions under healthy and diseased conditions will not only advance our fundamental knowledge of these phenomena but also enable drug discovery and high throughput screening with time and cost benefits cells sense and adapt to complex microenvironment in vivo which consists of cellular and noncellular components ecm biochemical bioelectrical and biophysical factors although in vivo studies have been carried out to monitor cell cell interactions and cell signaling within their native microenvironments these studies are limited by expensive experimental manipulations g animal models lack of control over local experimental conditions and complex imaging setups study of cell cell interactions in vitro is advantageous due to more tightly controlled experimental conditions higher experimental throughput and lower costs among in vitro approaches microfluidics has proven to be powerful technology to study cell biology over the past few years offering significant improvements over traditional cellular assays such as user defined assay design and precise control of the cellular and noncellular microenvironment in particular microfluidic cell culture systems have been designed with wide variety of microchannel dimensions and geometries for generating soluble and insoluble gradients on chip valving and pumping through multilayer fabrication and incorporation of membranes and three dimensional hydrogels for increased functionality the first generation of microfluidic cell culture devices enabled the study of cellular behaviors of single cell type under well defined biochemical gradients shear stress and cell ecm interactions in three dimensions developing next generation microfluidic devices to investigate cell cell and cell ecm signaling is highly desirable due to the ability to integrate multiple cell types and controlled microenvironments at physiologically relevant length and time scales new microfluidic assays for cell cell signaling should enable user defined control of the distance and type of interaction between different cell populations along with spatiotemporal delivery of biochemical and biophysical stimuli individually or combined to different cell populations furthermore integration with quantitative assays for measuring the intracellular g fluorescent calcium dyes and extracellular g elisa ref signals will be critical for obtaining dose response curves and validating the results against traditional assays advancing the state of the art microfluidic platforms for modeling measuring and imaging cell cell signaling will be important to improve our understanding of the effects of homotypic and heterotypic cell cell interactions on fundamental cellular behavior tissue morphogenesis and disease furthermore it may provide tools for the development of surrogate organ platforms for preclinical drug and toxicity testing and clinical diagnostics assays of individual patient samples as an early step toward personalized medicine in the first section of this review we present brief overview of conventional and micropatterning approaches used to study cell cell interactions in the second part we review the use of microfluidic devices to recreate and monitor heterotypic cell cell interactions and culture tissue specimens with applications in diverse areas such as vascular biology tumor biology liver and neural tissue engineering along with some recent data from our own laboratory finally we summarize the possible applications of the microfluidic cell cell interaction devices and discuss future research directions cell cell signaling is often studied using macroscale culture systems such as transwell assays two dimensional plating or seeding of different cell populations and addition of excised tissues into existing cultures these assays are also termed as macroscale culture assays because of the inability to control cell plating and biomolecular transport at length scales down to cell diameter the transwell assay includes porous filter to allow for biomolecular transport between two separate wells where two different cell populations can be seeded these assays can only facilitate paracrine interactions between two cell populations because of stiff nondegradable filter inhibiting direct contact and have provided biological insight into the interactions of large variety of cell types such as neuron astrocytes tumor endothelial cells fibroblasts epithelial cells and fibroblasts tumor cells other macroscale coculture strategies have employed seeding different cell populations on d substrate fig ref or within biologically degradable ecm fig and these platforms have enabled both paracrine signaling and direct physical interactions of cell populations most macroscale coculture studies have focused on the interactions between two cell populations as mentioned above although recently triculture systems have also been employed for the study of epithelial fibroblast adipocyte interactions during human breast development hepatocyte hepatic stellate cell endothelial cell interactions recreating the liver microstructure and myoblast embryonic fibroblast endothelial cells for skeletal muscle tissue vascularization although these macroscale coculture assays have provided significant insights into how interactions among different cell populations regulate cellular phenotype major limitation is the lack of control over cell cell distance and the degree of cell cell interaction because they are based on global seeding strategies furthermore macroscale culture assays are usually not easily adaptable for live cell imaging and do not offer the capability to create locally defined biochemical bioelectrical and biophysical stimuli conditions such as growth factor concentration gradients and shear stress imposed through blood or interstitial flow in the following we briefly discuss microfabrication approaches which can overcome these limitations by providing control over spatial distribution of cells in culture resulting in better manipulation of homotypic and heterotypic cell cell interactions microfabrication technology has enabled the creation of patterned surfaces fig and scaffolds fig with improved spatial control over macroscale culture platforms these systems termed microscale culture platforms have been utilized to explore the effects of homotypic and heterotypic cell cell interactions on tissue functions with length scales ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers for more detailed discussion the reader is referred to the papers by bhatia et al and kaji et al hybrid coculture systems integrating both conventional and microscale approaches have also been developed for example torisawa et al developed coculture microarrays by using polydimethylsiloxane pdms stamp to create wells for seeding two different cell populations in micropatterned systems the arrays of different wells are usually fed by single larger well creating numerous challenges with respect to the cell seeding protocol and the establishment of different test conditions in different wells as shown in fig the assay configuration and dimensionality influences intercellular distance which will in turn determine the mode of cell cell interaction g paracrine or physical contact and the effective concentration of soluble factors sensed by both cell types compared with micropatterned systems microfluidic devices incorporate flow control and allow for spatiotemporally user defined delivery of cells within different channels or scaffolds along with the capabilities to control and monitor biochemical and biophysical stimuli microfluidic approaches offer useful platform for developing new cell cell interaction assays fig and organized cellular structures tissue specimen culture fig under controlled conditions which more accurately mimic the complex in vivo microenvironment microfluidic microfluidic cell culture the field of microfluidic cell culture has grown significantly over the past decade and microfluidic platforms are becoming very attractive for

traditional cell biology assays number of advantages over traditional petri dish culture make microfluidic platforms more attractive for cell biology user defined assay design ii control of cell patterning seeding and cellular microenvironmental factors at relevant length scales iii small reagent media volumes iv excellent adaptability to imaging equipment and multiplexing capacities for applications in screening assays one area of microfluidic cell culture that has received considerable interest is microfluidic gradient generators which can expose cells to controlled biochemical stimuli wide variety of device designs have been developed to precisely control the spatiotemporal distribution of biochemical cues soluble or patterned on surfaces to recreate biomolecular gradients with tunable concentration profiles and time scales in or environments in addition to biochemical factors microfluidic devices integrating continuous flow conditions have been used to expose cells to biophysical stimuli such as controlled levels of shear stress and interstitial flow through d matrix despite these advantages cell culture in microfluidic devices is associated with number of new challenges that need to be taken into consideration majority of microfluidic devices are fabricated from pdms which can have two potential side effects on cell behavior adsorption of small hydrophobic molecules into the polymer and leaching of uncured pdms oligomers into the channels in recent study regehr et al showed that uncured pdms oligomers could be detected on the cell membrane of cultured cells in the pdms channels furthermore these authors used quantitative elisa assays to demonstrate that small hydrophobic molecule estrogen da partitioned into the surrounding pdms which could have resulted therefore in decreased effective estrogen concentration available to the cells apart from the standard pdms based devices the use of biocompatible materials such as alginate collagen chitosan and other hydrogels has received considerable interest as reviewed by domachuk et al furthermore frequent culture media change in microfluidic devices lacking continuous flow can become an issue especially for large cell numbers or rapidly proliferating cells resulting in nutrients and oxygen depletion media depletion can be eliminated by establishing fluid flow in the device on chip by integrating peristaltic pump or by interfacing external flow devices with respect to cell cell interaction assays care must be taken in selecting the appropriate media for cocultures efficient cell seeding for optimizing cell viability combining experimental results with computational models to predict and analyze transport of paracrine factors and quantifying results with reproducible image data analysis results from microfluidic assays must be carefully interpreted in comparison to macroscale culture data due to the inherently different transport phenomena in microfluidic and macroscale cultures in studies which require high throughput screening of large cell numbers the hydrodynamic environment needs to be considered as discussed by yin et al in their studies yin et al demonstrated that the shear stress levels need to be appropriately tuned in order to provide good quantitative agreement between intracellular calcium flux measurements in single cell microfluidic assays and traditional well plate assays microfluidic studies of most studies have addressed the effects of biochemical and biophysical microenvironments on single cell type referred here as monoculture the flexibility of microfluidic device design enables multiple microchannels to be incorporated at user defined physiologically relevant spacings allowing for culture of multiple cell types furthermore ecm environments can be incorporated into these channels while allowing for real time imaging and control of the biochemical and biophysical factors through the ecm in secs and iii we review research in microfluidic device design for studying heterotypic cell cell interactions and tissue specimen culture along with some relevant studies from our laboratory mural endothelial mural cells refer to the pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells smcs which surround blood vessels in the formation of normal mature vasculature vessel maturation requires various angiogenic factors to assist endothelial cells ecs in forming cell cell junctions and creating vessel wall containing mural cells not only chemical factors g ang pdgf tgf p pigf but also mechanical stimuli g interstitial flow smooth muscle activation play an important role in vessel maturation and remodeling however lack of concise knowledge of mural cells physical and paracrine interactions with ecs with respect to their matrix synthesis and deposition potential suggests the need for mural cell ec coculture model earlier coculture models between ecs and mural cells which included direct coculture coculture separated by extracellular matrix and spheroidal coculture suggested that ecs modulate the proliferation of mural cells and that mural cells regulate ec quiescence d microfluidic coculture model including ecs and smcs was established by our group enabling real time monitoring and quantification of cell migration under controlled biochemical and biophysical conditions this coculture model enabled seeding of ecs and mural cells individually in different channels allowing for the establishment of test and control conditions simultaneously in the same experiment fig the collagen type gel physically separates the initial populations of ecs and mural cells but allows for paracrine communication between the two cell types via diffusion cells are capable of migrating through the gel and physically interacting with each other while still maintaining their morphology mack et al used this platform to study the effect of endothelial kruppel like factor klf expression on smc migration which has implications in the biomechanical remodeling of blood vessels in response to shear stress quantification of smc migration demonstrated that klf overexpression on ecs reduced the number of invading smcs into the gel compared to the control ec condition and smc monoculture demonstrating that paracrine signaling between ec smc regulates smc invasion we also investigated the effects of smc ec interactions on ec monolayer stabilization and sprouting results figs and showed that ecs formed continuous monolayer in the microfluidic channel and could form vascular sprouts into the collagen type gel ii smc actively migrated toward the endothelial monolayer fig and iii smc migration was enhanced by the presence of ecs interestingly the presence of smc precursor murine cells resulted in stabilized ec monolayers fig while the control side of ec developed small number of sprouts distally from the smc these two microfluidic studies suggest that bidirectional paracrine signaling controls not only smc invasion but also ec phenotype sprouting or stabilized to further investigate paracrine signaling an important extension of this work would be to study how smc migration and ec sprouting depend on their intercellular distance as defined by the width of the collagen type gel microfluidic systems integrating control over paracrine and direct physical interactions between ecs and mural cells under controlled microenvironmental g shear stress conditions may also be utilized for improving scaffold vascularization which is of critical importance in tissue engineering applications finally systems need to be developed that allow for vascularization across the entire length of d matrix so that the mural cell ec interactions can be observed in more natural setting hepatocyte endothelial vascularization of tissue engineered constructs is still key challenge in the field of liver tissue engineering numerous culture methods of hepatocytes have been previously reported which suggest that the supply of oxygen and nutrients by diffusion becomes limited as hepatocytes are cultured in and the cultured hepatocyte tissues become thicker since the diffusion limit for oxygen is presumed to be cells in the tissues need vascular networks to transport oxygen nutrients and metabolites detailed understanding of the hepatocyte endothelial cell interactions will have significant implications for developing improved liver tissue engineering approaches we recently developed hepatocyte ec coculture model in microfluidic device to investigate the interactions between hepatocytes and ecs the device has two microfluidic channels one in which hepatocytes were seeded and second seeded with ecs separated by d gel region which allowed for cell cell communication and cell migration first hepatocytes were introduced into the top channel fig and they formed tissues when they were exposed to interstitial flow across the collagen gel between the top and the bottom channels when ecs were introduced into the bottom channel to initiate coculture they migrated into collagen gel and formed capillary networks extending toward the hepatocyte tissues in the top channel this result shows that hepatocyte ec interactions promote ec capillary morphogenesis since ec monoculture under these conditions does not lead to sprout formation the coculture model described above can be extended to triculture model in which hepatocytes hepatic stellate cells hscs and ecs are sequentially introduced in controlled fashion fig first hepatocytes were seeded in one channel and they formed tissues similar to that observed in hepatocyte ec coculture when hscs were also introduced into the same channel they migrated across the hepatocyte tissues and some cells migrated into the collagen type gel finally when ecs were seeded into the opposite channel to create the triculture model they extended into the collagen matrix to form vascular sprouts which developed into capillary networks within the gel results showed that hepatocytes formed tissues adjacent to collagen gel on day region fig while hscs extended cytoplasmic processes within the collagen gel and intervened between the hepatocyte tissues and ecs on day region fig and ecs formed capillary networks extending toward hscs and hepatocytes on day region fig thus it can be concluded that spatial and temporal control of cell seeding in microfluidic device results in controlled cellular morphogenesis depending on each cell type this triculture model could be further improved by the incorporation of hydrogels which would provide for longer term cultures minimizing cell mediated gel contraction for investigating potential modulation of endothelial sprout formation by the hepatocytes and hscs in related study hepatocyte hsc ec triculture model was established using conventional culture technique in which sequential layers of hepatocytes hsc and ec were created with microporous membrane hscs mediated the communication between hepatocytes and ecs in terms of ec capillary morphogenesis however the role of hscs on ec capillaries is still unknown and needs to be elucidated using methods such as the microfluidic triculture model described above one of the factors that limit the detailed study of these heterotypical cell interactions is the difficulty in measuring the various factors being secreted from each cell type to mediate the signaling since the medium volumes are so small standard biochemical assays are of limited value the expression of factors with fluorescent labeling or scaffold tethered probes would be advantageous but the development of these can be an arduous process even for small number of targets thus identification of the critical signaling pathways remains major hurdle tumor endothelial the interactions of tumor cells tcs with vascular ecs are critical for tumor progression as well as for later stages of cancer metastasis these interactions include paracrine signaling of angiogenic factors secreted from the tumor cells especially during the initial stages of tumor development leading to the formation of new and leaky vessels at later stages once the tcs invade toward the ecs contact interactions including receptor mediated processes become important in heterotypic tc ec adhesion and transendothelial migration it is important to note that the tc ec interactions occur within the tumor microenvironment including other metastasis regulating factors such as cell ecm contact biophysical forces and other host cells studying these processes in vivo is difficult while conventional in vitro cultures do not mimic the in vivo conditions microfluidic devices allow for the integration of these critical microenvironmental factors and cell cell interactions offering new cellular assays which can provide insight into how cancer cell metastatic potential is influenced by these factors and their interactions using controlled assembly of two complementary substrates on which hela cervical cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded separately kaji et al developed coculture assay to study the effect of paracrine factors on cell migration of both types in recent study from the same group the authors incorporated flow control to investigate the influence of paracrine signaling on cell behavior the authors showed that flow from the ecs to the tcs had no effect on the net movement of either cell type whereas by switching flow direction the ecs retracted and the tcs migrated into the empty space although the above work represents simple platform to study paracrine interactions the cells were seeded on d substrate which is significant limitation for studying cell migration in the context of cancer invasion and cancer angiogenesis by integrating flow control and an endothelial monolayer on microfluidic channel song et al presented novel system to model tc adhesion on ecs during blood borne metastasis their system enables spatially restricted basal cytokine stimulation of the endothelial monolayer seeded on porous membrane the authors showed that either basal addition of cxcl or increasing shear stress from to dyn cm enhanced metastatic breast cancer cell adhesion compared to apical stimulation demonstrating the synergistic effects of biochemical and biophysical activation on cell adhesion under flow our group recently developed microfluidic based assays to monitor tc ec interactions in real time while enabling accurate control of biochemical and biophysical factors within d matrix an important advantage of this system fig is its ability to recreate not only paracrine interactions fig through soluble factor communication between both cell types across the ecm but also physical contact interactions once the tumor cells adhere to the endothelial monolayer fig furthermore the system is capable of high resolution time lapse microscopy for visualizing the dynamics of tc ec interactions figs and the incorporated collagen type gel can be remodeled both by tumor and endothelial cells allowing for the formation of new blood vessels and better mimicking in vivo conditions one microenvironmental factor which was not considered in the coculture studies described by our group is fluid flow mediated shear stress level on the ec which could be integrated by establishment of continuous flow along the ec channel this microfluidic system could also be used to study multiple steps of the metastatic cascade while incorporating additional metastasis supporting cell types such as fibroblasts or immune cells and this represents an important direction for future work other given the role of epithelial stromal cell interactions in wide array of diseases number of groups have developed microfluidic coculture systems for studying these interactions and understanding their biological behavior these systems offer several major improvements over conventional boyden chamber based transwell assays such as real time assessment of cell activity in environment and the ability to spatially pattern multiple cell types consistently bauer et al used simple array of microchannels to coculture carcinoma cells and fibroblasts and compared it to traditional macroscale coculture the authors observed that compared to monocultures of carcinoma cells coculturing carcinoma cells with fibroblasts enhanced their proliferation and led to larger cell cluster formation in another study of stromal tumor cell interactions liu et al showed that cancer associated fibroblasts cafs promote gland adenoid cystic carcinoma cell invasion in microfluidic coculture model the authors found that the increase in cancer cell invasion was specific to the cafs since coculture with normal fibroblast cell line did not promote cancer cell invasion furthermore the authors showed that the increased invasion could be prohibited by using matrix metalloproteinase mmp inhibitors in similar study huang et al developed microfluidic device which allows cell seeding in multiple adjacent gel channels to more accurately resemble the tumor microenvironment when metastatic breast cancer cells and macrophages were cultured in collagen and matrigel respectively they observed that macrophages invaded into the collagen gel only when cancer cells were present within the gel similarly progressive macrophage invasion was observed over days of culture which suggests that the cancer cells may have been releasing signaling molecules that activated macrophage and invasion consistent with other in vitro and in vivo studies these studies shed light on the dynamic remodeling of ecm matrix by host cells and invading cells the pattern of cell migration and the various roles of biochemical and biophysical stimuli within the complex tumor microenvironment during nervous system development numerous guidance molecules play critical role in directing the tip of growing neurites growth cones to their final destinations resulting in the formation of complex circuitry studying the precise mechanism by which these guidance molecules are presented to the growth cones diffusion binding to ecm paracrine signaling has been an intense area of research over the past few years and numerous in vitro systems have been employed for this purpose however traditional assays such as bath application of growth factors substrate bound cues tissue explant culture in vitro pipette turning assay and dunn chamber assay are limited by their cultures difficulty in quantification lack of spatiotemporal control on growth factor delivery and sensing and low reproducibility we addressed these limitations by developing microfluidic assay in which primary neurons could be seeded onto three dimensional collagen gel and cocultured in the presence of another cell type transfected to release guidance cue over the culture period the device has chamber for filling d gel three channels for supplying media and seeding cells and growth factor gradient can be created across the scaffold mimicking in vivo conditions when mouse hippocampal neurons were cultured in these devices in the bottom channel netrin transfected fibroblasts in the right channel and untransfected dermal fibroblasts in the left channel so as to create netrin gradient across the gel it was observed that significantly higher number of extending neurites were attracted toward netrin transfected fibroblasts compared to control cultures with no fibroblasts or cultures which received netrin exogenously instead these results offer great insight into the functioning of guidance molecule sensing by growth cones in the presence of different microenvironmental conditions and the utility of this device in drug screening and fundamental neurobiological assays this device could be further improved by modifying the gel chamber geometry to provide independent control of the chemoattractant absolute concentration and gradient strength for elucidating the growth cone chemoattractant gradient sensitivity in d matrix also continuous flow of media and growth factor gradients can be incorporated using reservoir system which eliminates the need for gradient reestablishment after regular intervals the advantages of this device include the ease of handling and cell culture in environment rapid generation of pressure differentials and growth factor gradients across d gel on demand provision to coculture up to three different cell types live cell imaging precise quantification of axonal turning in high reproducibility of experimental observations and ability to even culture tissue biopsies under controlled environments periprosthetic osteolysis pathological condition after total hip replacement occurs when the implant debris usually polymeric or metallic activates resident macrophages to release cytokines which indirectly signal osteoblasts and osteoclasts possibly resulting in bone resorption and decoupling of implant tissue interface however investigating these cell cell interactions in cocultures without actual physical contact between the cell types has been challenge with conventional techniques wei et al developed microfluidic system by laser direct writing on polymethyl methacrylate pmma substrates which permits culturing two different cell types separately in upstream and downstream microwells separated by microchannel that allows media exchange an inherent advantage of this system is that it permits direct rapid media transfer with built in linear concentration gradients from one cell type to the other unlike conventional coculture systems which use transferred conditioned media the authors found that inflammatory cytokines such as tnf and il were released by macrophages cultured in upstream wells upon exposure to ml pmma debris which stimulated prostaglandin release by osteoblasts cultured in downstream wells this microfluidic coculture platform offers important advantages over transwell assays but it is limited to d substrate and one directional cell cell communication under flow conditions because of the serial connections between upstream downstream wells although bidirectional paracrine interactions could be achieved under static conditions microfluidic devices are also well suited to recreate and study homotypic cell cell interactions in physiologically relevant time and length scales similar to heterotypic cell cell interactions discussed above for example klauke et al developed microfluidic platform to form cardiac myocyte doublets and measure the transmission of calcium waves through the intercellular junctions formed by these cells yin et al described microfluidic device based on dielectrophoretic forces to recreate interactions between cell pair of endothelial cells and demonstrated that secreted matrix proteins and growth factors can have considerable guidance effects on cell motility tissue specimen culture in microfluidic the examples discussed above have amply demonstrated the utility of microfluidic systems for studying cocultures of dissociated cells to obtain valuable information about the cell cell interactions although the cell ecm interactions also play critical role in maintaining physiological homeostasis or in tumor progression understanding these interactions in great detail has not been possible due to difficulties associated with culturing tissue slices ecm regulates cell differentiation migration and proliferation serves as reservoir for growth factors and provides substrate for cell attachment and spreading for example ecm components of brain tissue collagens laminin proteoglycans play major role in nerve cell guidance axonal outgrowth and synapse formations similarly different subregions of the brain g prefrontal cortex hippocampus hypothalamus communicate via localized neuronal pathways thereby maintaining normal brain functionality elucidating these processes that guide cell tissue and tissue tissue interactions not only provides insight into the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders but also unlocks the signaling pathways involved during embryogenesis while in vivo experiments designed to understand the interactions between various brain tissue types g thalamocortical cortex hippocampal have yielded valuable information they are limited by global delivery of experimental conditions usually through biomolecule injection in the blood circulation ii lack of controlled manipulation of selective regions of tissues and iii alterations in cellular properties such as growth rate morphology and metabolic activities due to experimental manipulation which affects native signaling cascade between cells and surrounding tissues in that region to overcome these limitations there is critical need to establish in vitro cell tissue and tissue tissue coculture systems which closely mimic the complex in vivo microenvironment there are very few reports in the literature that detail the applications of microfluidic systems for culturing tissue sections in vitro queval et al reported on the fabrication of microfluidic system consisting of perfusion chamber and microfluidic probe for localized microperfusion of small number of cells within m slice of mice hippocampal tissue advantages of this system over conventional perfusion chambers include its ease of assembly adaptability to existing perfusion chambers long term low shear stress on brain tissue slice and cells within and simultaneous high resolution fluorescence imaging this system might permit local delivery of ions and drugs for selective manipulation of slice regions and for studying neuronal interactions and remodeling within tissue using high resolution imaging toward developing high throughput assay for personalized cancer therapy kim et al developed and tested microfluidic system for culturing thin sections of human breast cancer tissue or breast carcinoma cells the device consisted of reservoirs for reagents biomarker reservoirs individual microvalves for each reservoir and reaction channels to fit the breast tumor biopsy tissues by employing quantitative histopathological techniques on these tissue sections they showed that several cancer related proteins estrogen receptor progesterone receptor ki etc can be identified on single tumor tissue slice unlike conventional whole section analysis this device not only minimized the time and cost of analysis reduced biopsy tissue size and reagents consumption but also enhanced the sensitivity and repeatability of the assay angiogenesis the process of new blood vessel formation from existing blood vessels plays an essential role in wound healing fetal development and tumor progression by supplying oxygen and vital nutrients previous in vitro microfluidic studies utilized monolayers of endothelial cells on d gel and investigated the effect of angiogenic growth factors and matrix density on sprouting barkefors et al utilized the recent development in microfluidic technology of creating stable growth factor gradients with the goal of investigating directional angiogenesis in cultures of tissues and cells the device design permits culturing of differentiating stem cells or embryonic mouse kidney tissue section in the central chamber with two fluidic channels on the sides across which continuous stable growth factor gradient can be established within results invariably showed that gradients of growth factors vegfa fgf vegfc promoted angiogenesis and invasive sprouting into matrix on the side of kidney tissue facing high levels of growth factor similarly embryoid bodies of mouse embryonic stem cells exhibited significantly higher directional sprouting toward increasing concentration of vegfa gradient in these devices thus development of microfluidic devices such as the one described here offers great advantage not only in developmental biology and molecular mechanism studies but also in preclinical testing toward personalized medicine recently gunther et al developed microfluidic device for loading small artery tissue segment on chip to probe its structure and function this platform enabled long term culture of the explants on chip imaging immobilization and spatiotemporal controlled delivery of drugs the authors validated their method by demonstrating that the phenylephrine dose response curves for mouse mesenteric arteries agreed very well with conventional pressure myograph measurements to overcome current limitations of organotypic brain slice cultures berdichevsky et al recently developed microfluidic device to culture slices of rodent hippocampus over several weeks for electrophysiological studies the device consisted of designated miniwell for holding the tissue slice thick patterned microchannels for axonal guidance and large channel for medium circulation when the tissue slice was placed on glass cover slip coated with polylysine firm tissue attachment and neurite outgrowth were observed within three days of culture compared to uncoated surface cultures similarly extensive microchannel guided neurite extension from hippocampal slices was observed after seven days of culture which suggests broad applications in tissue engineering approaches designed for regenerating lost axonal pathways due to injury or disease in later study the same group extended their previous platform to accommodate two designated chambers for holding brain slice tissues and interconnected microchannels for facilitating axonal outgrowth results showed that cocultures of hippocampal slices or entorhinal cortex and hippocampal slices not only survived in these devices for up to four weeks but also formed functional axon connectivity between them within days of culture axonal outgrowth from these tissues was observed within three days with the microchannels effectively isolating the tissue slices pharmacologically during two channel perfusion with experimental media the bidirectional axonal connectivity between tissue slices started synchronizing the two slice network in the presence of gaba receptor antagonists after days of culture in vitro as evidenced from the recordings of individual external electrodes placed in these slices thus signifying the applicability of this assay to study synapse formation in vitro under various pharmacological and physiological conditions considerable progress has been made in microfluidic cell culture just in the past few years which has enabled the development of novel assays under well defined biochemical and biophysical conditions studying homogeneous and heterogeneous cell populations in vitro has demonstrated the critical importance of cell cell communication for basic cellular functions such as survival proliferation migration and differentiation under both normal and diseased conditions by integrating heterotypic culture microenvironmental control and high resolution real time imaging microfluidic technology is suited for creating new tissue engineering tools and novel cellular assays the microfluidic assays described here have enabled the study of previously unexplored cellular interactions and are already providing new insights into how biochemical and biophysical factors can regulate interactions between different cell populations progress in this area will have significant implications in drug discovery and artificial organ systems in vitro and offers time and cost benefits for high throughput drug screening despite significant progress in the field of microfluidic cell culture numerous challenges remain that need to be addressed in future studies vast majority of microfluidic platforms are pdms based which has the advantage of rapid prototyping capabilities but poses problems for surface chemistry modifications and mass production in order for these assays to be compatible with standard pharmaceutical drug screening hard plastic polycarbonates polystyrene fabrication processes have to be adopted in the near future most of the current studies in microfluidic coculture platforms have focused on large cell populations cells and have only investigated maximum of two different cell types integrating more than two cell types with biologically degradable gels and controlled biochemical and biophysical conditions will allow for improved organotypic culture models while also providing new insights into cellular interactions with heterotypic cells soluble and insoluble factors scaling these platforms down to smaller cell populations will facilitate drug screening on patient samples and prove valuable tool for personalized medicine finally the development of microfluidic platforms incorporating real time control over cell seeding and measurement of paracrine signals secretion will be important for understanding the dynamics of cellular interactions an area which remains unexplored since most microfluidic studies have largely focused on measuring end point cellular responses  this paper reports the fabrication of zinc oxide zno based quantum dot sensitized solar cell using cadmium sulphide cds quantum dots qds capped by poly vinyl alcohol pva chemical route was used to synthesize zno nanoparticles nps as well as cds qds the crystallite size of zno nps was obtained to be nm at ph the size of qds decreased from to nm with increase in the pva concentration from to wt there is blue shift in the band gap of qds with increase in the concentration of pva current voltage characteristic of the cell was obtained and various solar cell parameters were estimated the efficiency of quantum dot sensitized solar cells was found to be at am quantum dot sensitized solar cells qdsscs have attracted extensive interest as means of fabricating highly efficient stable and low cost photovoltaic device because of the tuneable bandgap of the quantum dots from the last few decades most of the research in the field of solar energy are focused on dye sensitized solar cells dsscs in which the problem of wastage of photon energy above the difference between lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and highest occupied molecular orbital homo energies is dominant because one photon gives rise to one exciton only and rest of the energy contained in the photon is wasted as heat quantum dots qds have specific advantages over dyes to be used as sensitizers in dsscs it is observed that if dye in dssc is replaced by qds then the energy contained in photon can be fully utilized because in qds single photon gives rise to multiple excitons this effect is known as multiple exciton generation meg effect the production of multiple excitons by single photon in quantum confined systems may improve the efficiency of solar cells researchers have already accomplished the production of or more excitons per photon with energy greater than the bandgap in pbse qd based system the sensitization in qdssc is based on the band gap alteration due to the quantum confinement effect qce the absorption edge of qds can be tailored by exploiting quantum confined regime of different sized qds the bandgap of the qds can be tuned by controlling their size and therefore the absorption spectra of the qds can be tuned to match the spectral distribution of the sun light qds can be embedded on front tio zno electrode to achieve enhanced light harvesting in the visible spectrum however in spite of the fact that different sized different bandgap qds are available the energy conversion efficiency of qdsscs is still low the less conversion efficiency of the qdsscs may be due to the difficulty of embedding the qds into the mesoporous tio zno structure another problem is the selection of efficient electrolyte in which the qdssc can function without degradation but if suitable linking molecule which could link qds to tio zno surface and electrolyte be used then qds can be used to improve the efficiency of dsscs much research has been done on the fabrication of qdsscs in which qds are embedded in mesoporous tio zno structure by cbd method sudhagar et al have reported nanospherical tio mesoporous layer combined with cds qds as qdssc application and the resulting efficiency was chang et el have reported energy conversion efficiency of using i electrolyte in cds based qdssc zhang et al have reported maximum power conversion efficiency of for cbd cycles of cds zno nanowire system tak et al have reported the cds zno nanowire structure as an enhanced photocatalytic activity because the cds zno system can efficiently separate photogenerated electron hole pair and reduce their recombination chen et al have reported an efficiency of in cds and cdse co sensitized qdssc based on zno nanowire in the present work zno nanoparticles nps and cds qds were synthesised via chemical route synthesized zno nps were successfully used as front zno electrode in qdssc effect of poly vinyl alcohol pva concentration on structural and optical properties of qds was investigated various parameters of cds sensitized solar cell were calculated all the reagents used were of analytical grade and no further purification was done before use synthesis of zno zinc acetate dihydrate zn ch coo o alfa aesar was used as zinc precursor the sol was prepared by dissolving of zinc acetate dihydrate in methanol at room temperature clear and transparent sol with no precipitate and turbidity was obtained by ultrasonic stirring of the solution for naoh alfa aesar was then added to the sol to adjust the ph level of the sol to the so modified sol was again stirred ultrasonically for at room temperature the ph value of the sol was adjusted to add the desired value of oh ions in the sol the clear sol was filtered and kept for complete gelation and hydrolysis process till zno precipitate slowly crystallized and settled down at the bottom of the flask the white precipitate was filtered and washed with excess methanol to remove the starting materials precipitate was dried at for min on hot plate and ground for min in mortar pestle the nanopowder so obtained was annealed at for in air by microprocessor controlled annealing furnace with the annealing rate min synthesis of cds cadmium chloride cdcl alfa aesar was used as cadmium source sodium sulphide na alfa aesar was used as reducing agent poly vinyl alcohol pva alfa aesar was used as capping agent nanoparticles formed during the process need to be surface passivated as colloids formed in liquid have tendency to coagulate therefore capping agent is used to achieve stability and avoid coalescence pva is used as capping agent because of its excellent emulsifying property because of which it controls and stabilizes the particle formation by increasing the kinetic stability of the reactants ml of cdcl ml of na m and ml of wt pva solutions were made in deionized di water cdcl was added to pva solution and stirred continuously na was then added to the above solution and again stirred ultrasonically for the experiment was repeated for wt and wt of pva the chemical reaction taking place is cdcl na cds nacl the solution was kept undisturbed till the precipitate was collected at the bottom precipitate was then filtered and dried on hot plate at for min the dried precipitate after grinding was annealed at for min the colour of cds qds changed from light yellow to orange with decreasing pva concentration preparation of zno zno nanopowder was ground by mortar and pestle with ml di water and polyethylene glycol peg alfa aesar peg was used to break up the aggregated particles into dispersed paste thus prepared uniform slurry was coated on indium tin oxide ito glass by doctor blade technique using an adhesive scotch tape to control the thickness of the zno film and to provide non coated areas for electrical contact as spacers after natural drying at room temperature the film was sintered in air at for min preparation of gel the gel electrolyte was prepared by using polyethylene oxide peo alfa aesar solution in acetonitrile and carbon nanotube cnt alfa aesar with lii alfa aesar and m alfa aesar the whole mixture was placed for sonication to disperse the cnts into the matrix of polymer the mixture was stirred for by magnetic stirrer for complete mixing between cnts and polymer molecules to fabricate qdssc prepared zno film electrode was first immersed in mercapto propionic acid which acts as linker molecule between zno film electrode and qds the modified zno electrode was immersed in cds qd colloidal solution consisting of all the three synthesized qds the colloidal solution was formed in toluene by ultrasonication for the electrode was immersed in qd solution for at room temperature the qd adsorbed electrode was then rinsed with toluene and dried at room temperature to minimize adsorption of impurities from moisture in the ambient air the electrode was dipped in the qd solution while it was still warm the colour of zno electrode changes to yellow after adsorption of cds qds i electrolyte was spread on the qd coated zno electrode sandwich type qdssc was fabricated with the cds qds sensitized zno electrode thin platinum sheet as counter electrode spacer and an electrolyte the schematic diagram of qdssc is shown in figure in qdsscs semiconductors such as cds cdse pbs and inp which absorb light in visible region work as sensitizers because they are able to transfer electrons to wide bandgap semiconductors such as zno tio sno etc the energy level diagram of qdssc is shown in figure the working principle of qdssc is based on excitation of qds by photons of light and fast electron injection into the conduction band of zno the injected electron in the conduction band of zno percolates through the porous zno structure and is fed to the ito layer which acts as the charge collecting electrode in the cell the porous zno electrode is typically thick through ito the electron moves to the external circuit at the pt counter electrode triiodide i is reduced to iodide by taking the electrons from pt electrode is transported through the electrolyte towards the ito photoelectrode where it reduces the oxidized qd the qd is then ready for next excitation oxidation reduction cycle we can see that the working mechanism of qdssc is similar to that of dssc the only difference being that in qdssc dye is replaced by qds of varying size by which more light can be harvested and hence the overall efficiency of the cell can be improved ray diffraction xrd measurements of the zno nps and cds qds were carried out using bruker axs discover diffractometer having cuk incident beam structural properties of zno nps and cds qds were observed by using tecnai t twin tem the absorbance of zno nps cds qds and cds qd embedded zno electrode in the visible region was measured using shimadzu solidspec uv vis nir spectrophotometer v characteristic of the cell was measured using computerised digital keithley source meter and m newport class solar simulator the measurement was made at am the active electrode area was typically cm analysis of zno the xrd pattern of the synthesized zno nps is shown in figure the intensity of the diffraction peaks is very high showing that nps are highly crystalline in nature the strong diffraction peaks appear at and which correspond to and planes respectively indicating the hexagonal wurtzite structure of zno the preferred orientation corresponding to the plane is shown as the most dominating peak besides these dominant peaks other characteristic peaks of zno are also there showing that nps have grown in all these orientations but maximum growth has occurred in plane all the diffraction peaks coincide with jcpds card no for zno powder no characteristic peak of impurity was observed stating the fact that the synthesized nps are contamination free and will help not degrading the performance of qdssc due to impurity elements crystallite size was calculated by debye scherrer formula k cos where is the particle shape factor which depends on the shape of the particles and its value is for spherical particles is the full width at half maximum fwhm of the selected diffraction peak corresponding to plane and is the bragg angle obtained from value corresponding to the same plane crystallite size of zno nps is calculated to be nm transmission electron microscope tem image of the zno nps is shown in figure a drop of zno solution in methanol was drop cast on carbon coated copper grid and dried for before testing through tem tem image mainly consists of hexagonal shaped nps having an average particle size of approximately nm confirming the results obtained by xrd sem image of zno electrode is shown in figure the image clearly exhibits the porous nature of the zno layer this porous structure of zno helps in the sensitization of qds in qdssc because when qds are embedded on zno electrode qds actually go and sit in these pores where they get adsorbed fig that is why the cell is known as quantum dot sensitized solar cell because when light falls on such structure zno electrode on the top does not absorb light in the visible region large bandgap ev but passes it into the next qd layer where it gets absorbed and sensitizes the dots the optical absorption spectra of zno nps as function of energy in the visible region are shown in figure graph shows that zno does not absorb light in the visible region which means that prepared zno samples are transparent to visible light we can see that proper light absorbance takes place above bandgap energy of approximately ev below this energy absorption level decreases stating that below ev photons does not possess enough energy to excite the electrons from valence band to conduction band the overall analysis of the absorbance spectrum concludes that the synthesized zno nps can be successfully used as photoelectrode in qdssc analysis of cds xrd pattern of cds qds with different concentration of pva is shown in figure xrd pattern reveals that the dot size is dependent on concentration of pva as the pva concentration increases the fwhm also increases thereby decreasing the dot size the dominant peak position is observed at for plane which belongs to hexagonal structure of cds qds two more additional peaks are observed at and corresponding to and planes respectively dot size is calculated using debye scherrer formula the size of the cds qds decreases from to nm with increase in the pva concentration from to wt the synthesis of qds using polymeric stabilizers such as pva is very easy and requires ambient laboratory conditions the three dimensional network of the polymer chains efficiently restricts the particle formation to nanoscale for this purpose water soluble monomer or polymer compound is generally employed along with the reagents required for the synthesis of the qds recently researchers have used pva to stabilize cdse qds the higher concentration of pva increases the rate of reaction and thus uniform and smaller sized dots are formed the variation in fwhm and dot size with capping agent concentration is shown in figure fwhm increases with increase in the concentration of pva thereby decreasing the size of the dot tem analysis was further carried out to investigate more about cds phase tem images of cds qds with different pva concentration are shown in figure from the tem images it can be seen that the particle size varies from to nm with increase in the pva concentration from to wt therefore tem results confirm that the size of the qds is similar to the dot size obtained by the xrd measurements the selected area electron diffraction pattern saed of the qds is also shown in the inset from the saed pattern it is clear that the qds are crystalline in nature the optical absorption spectra of the cds qds of varying size and cds qds embedded on zno electrode are shown in figure absorbance spectra reveal that there is blue shift in the absorbance as the dot size decreases due to quantum confinement effect bandgap of the qds increases from to ev with decrease in dot size from to nm it is seen from the figure that the absorbance of the cds qd embedded zno electrode covers wide range of visible spectrum nm thus using cds qds as sensitizers onto zno nps resulted enhanced light harvesting of the solar energy the bandgap of cds qds can also be calculated using effective mass model it is the simplest model which predicts the effective bandgap eg due to three dimensional confinements the blue shift of the bandgap with decrease in dot size is described by the following equation eg egbulk where egbulk is the band gap of bulk cds h being planck constant is the dot size and is the effective reduced mass mo me mh where mo me and mh are the mass of the electron effective mass of electron and effective mass of hole respectively the second term in eq represents the kinetic energy the effective bandgap of the cds qds is found to be varying from to ev with decrease in dot size from to nm which agrees with the confinement regime the effective and experimental values of the qd bandgap as function of dot size are shown in figure it is clear that the bandgap decreases with increase in the cds qds size this is due to the quantum confinement effect in the dots qdssc was fabricated using the synthesized of zno nps and cds qds the cell was illuminated under one sun illumination am mw cm and v characteristic of

when the qdssc is illuminated excitons are generated in cds qds and charge separation is performed by zno cds qds electrolyte interface the resultant electrons are conducted to the ito layer through zno layer and the holes are recovered by i electrolyte isc depends on number of incident photons adsorbing pva capped cds onto zno could result in the hindrance of charge transport in the present case the pva capping molecules were removed by repeated washing with di water before incorporating them in zno electrode in qdssc which provides better charge carrier exchange between qds and the conducting polymer the overall conversion efficiency is found to be in conclusion zno based qdssc with an efficiency of at am has been successfully fabricated by sensitizing the zno electrode by cds qds the cds qds of varying size from to nm with increase in the bandgap from to ev respectively have been chemically synthesized the use of qds of varying bandgap resulted in the absorbance of broader spectrum of visible light in the range nm  this review presents systematic perspective on the development of micro optofluidic lenses the progress on the development of micro optofluidic lenses are illustrated by example from recent literature the advantage of micro optofluidic lenses over solid lens systems is their tunability without the use of large actuators such as servo motors depending on the relative orientation of light path and the substrate surface micro optofluidic lenses can be categorized as in plane or out of plane lenses however this review will focus on the tunability of the lenses and categorizes them according to the concept of tunability micro optofluidic lenses can be either tuned by the liquid in use or by the shape of the lens micro optofluidic lenses with tunable shape are categorized according to the actuation schemes typical parameters of micro optofluidic lenses reported recently are compared and discussed finally perspectives are given for future works in this field with applications ranging from mobile phone to laboratory on chip miniature lenses have been attracting attentions from research communities of both microfluidics and micro optics liquid lenses have emerged as promising candidate for miniaturization of imaging optics liquid lenses have number of apparent advantages such as tunable refractive index and reconfigurable geometry furthermore the control and actuation of the lens liquid benefit from the recent advances in microfluidics the combination of micro optics and microfluidics leads to the new research discipline of micro optofluidics that utilizes the interactions between fluids fluid flows and light to create new functional optical as well as microfluidic devices micro optofluidic lens is one of these novel devices excellent reviews on optofluidics were published recently by psaltis et al monat et al hunt and wilkinson levy and erickson et al as well as shamai micro optofluidic lenses were mentioned in these reviews but not in the necessary depth needed for researchers working on designing and implementing microfluidic lenses micro optofluidic lenses are considered in this review as lenses that use liquid as the optical medium and microfluidic techniques as mean for manipulation and actuation depending on the relative arrangement between the optical path and the substrate plane micro optofluidic lenses can be categorized as in plane and out of plane lenses while the light path of in plane lenses is in the plane of the device substrate out of plane lenses manipulate light paths perpendicular to this plane out of plane lenses are compatible to conventional fixed lens and could replace them in applications such as digital camera and cell phones however the fabrication process of out of plane lenses is more complex these lenses require precise alignment of the different optical layers in plane lenses are suitable for laboratory on chip applications because they can be integrated with the microfluidic network that performs the sample analysis due to this compatibility to microfluidics in plane lenses promise higher integration density and higher degree of complexity micro optofluidic lenses can be tuned by either refractive index or geometry refractive index of the liquid in micro optofluidic device can be modulated to change the phase the amplitude and the polarization of the light passing through the lens although the refractive index can be modified by different means such as pressure control electrowetting control optical control magnetic control thermo optic control and electro optic control the most common and simple way is to fill the lens with different liquids concentration of solution can also be used for controlling the refractive index the geometry of the lens can be modulated by variety of concepts known in microfluidics if the lens is formed with the liquid solid interface of flexible material such as polydimethylsiloxane pdms the shape can be controlled by applying pressure if the lens is formed with liquid liquid or air liquid interfaces the shape can be controlled by means of hydrodynamics electrowetting or other physical effects in this review micro optofluidic lenses are categorized and discussed based on the tunability of the liquid and the shape of the lens tunability with lens as mentioned above micro optofluidic lenses can be tuned by manipulating the refractive index of its liquid conventional optical tuning techniques change the refractive index by subjecting the liquid to an external electrical field acoustic field temperature field or mechanical strain microfluidic techniques such as pumping and mixing can be used for changing the lens liquid or its composition if the lens liquid is mixture the composition can be adjusted by integrating concentration generator and mixer on the same platform of the lens the time response of microfluidic manipulation is on the order of milliseconds since the entire liquid of lens can be changed large relative change in refractive index can be achieved for the extreme case of replacing air by liquid relative change of can be achieved none of the previous optical tuning techniques can achieve this high relative change of refractive index table lists the performance of the different tuning techniques compared to conventional tuning techniques micro optofluidic tuning is only faster than thermal tuning in many applications the lens is formed by the liquid liquid interface of coflowing streams the changing speed of the liquid streams depends on external or integrated pumps or valves thus the time response could be on the order of seconds table ii lists some common liquids used for micro optofluidic lenses since number of microfluidic as well as micro optofluidic devices were made in pdms the refractive index of pdms of is taken as the reference for choosing the right liquids for the lens the smoothness of the device surface depends on the quality of the photolithography mask and the microfabrication process in general the solid surface in microfluidic or micro optofluidic device cannot compete with the surface of conventional optical components only liquid liquid or an air liquid interface can create an atomically smooth surface to minimize scattering effects at the solid liquid interface the cladding liquid in micro optofluidic system should have refractive index matching to that of cured pdms table ii lists two examples of index matching solutions wt ethylene glycol with wt ethanol or wt glycerol with wt water both mixtures have comparable dynamic viscosity and density however the first mixture has lower surface tension with an index matching liquid as cladding lens liquid with lower or higher refractive index can be chosen most liquids with high refractive indices are organic compounds with possible health hazards while common liquids such as water and ethanol have lower refractive index than pdms so the use of low refractive index is desirable for designing micro optofluidic lens conventional optical components are designed with the assumption that the refractive index of the optical material is higher than the surrounding medium air for instance biconvex lens with high refractive index has focusing effect with pdms and the index matching liquid as the surrounding medium there are opportunities to design optical components with low refractive index such as biconcave lens for focusing light relatively safe liquid with high reflective index is cinnamaldehyde cinnamaldehyde is the organic compound that can be extracted from cinnamon this liquid has comparable viscosity as the index matching mixture mentioned above furthermore cinnamaldehyde is only slightly soluble in water and ethanol thus it is easy to form stable flow of almost immiscible interface with these liquids another unique property of liquid as optical material is controlled diffusion of species at laminar flow condition in microfluidics the concentration distribution of species is determined by molecular diffusion thus concentration gradient or refractive index gradient can be generated in the optical material taking the solution of calcium chloride cacl as an example refractive index from to can be adjusted by increasing the concentration of cacl in water from to table ii mao et al reported liquid gradient refractive index grin lens fig the lens is formed by diffusion of cacl from core stream with concentration of to the cladding stream of de ionized di water the refractive index decreases gradually from to the concentration profile and the corresponding refractive index profile can be controlled by the flow rate of the core stream and the two cladding streams the dimensionless number representing the relative ratio between advection transport and molecular diffusion is the peclet number pe ulchd where is the mean flow velocity lch is the characteristic diffusion length and is molecular diffusion coefficient higher flow rate results in higher peclet number where advective transport dominates over molecular diffusion higher peclet number therefore means larger gradient of refractive index large gradient of refractive index allows sharper bend of light beams resulting in shorter focal length the focal point cannot only be tuned along the flow direction but also in the direction perpendicular to it by changing the flow rate ratio of the cladding streams the concentration profile is screwed to one side allowing the light beam to be focused off the optical axis with the diffusion coefficient of calcium chloride of dcacl cm the peclet number for the grin lens reported in ref ranges from to another way to modify the optical properties of liquid is using scattering caused by suspended nanoparticles compared to smaller molecules the lower diffusion coefficient of nanoparticles would allow the liquid with modified refractive index to be contained in the stream the scattering nature makes suspending nanoparticles rather suitable for wave guiding than lensing applications besides grin lenses complex concentration distribution would allow designing other innovative micro optofludic devices wolfe et al utilized diffusive merging of two core streams to realize an optical splitter two core streams of ethylene glycol are separated by the cladding liquid with lower refractive index at low peclet numbers the two core streams merge to single stream with high refractive index this concentration distribution of the core liquid allows splitting single input beam into two output beams with equal intensities fig with the data from ref diffusion coefficient of ethylene glycol cm the condition for good mixing and consequently good light splitting is pe which is of the same order as required for grin lens similar to many other physical variables refractive index is temperature dependent refractive index usually decreases with increasing temperature temperature field can induce refractive index gradient the same concept of designing grin lens using concentration dependent refractive index can be used for thermal mixing of liquid streams since thermal diffusivity in liquids is about two orders of magnitude higher than molecular diffusion coefficient the flow rate does not need to be extremely low to reach peclet numbers on the order of the only drawback of using temperature to modulate refractive index is the relatively small thermo optical coefficient dn dt of most liquids for instance the thermo optical coefficient in the temperature range from to of water ethylene glycol and ethanol are and respectively seta et al used thermal lens formed by heat induced by focus light to detect nanoparticles tang et al generated temperature gradient and the corresponding refractive index gradient by coflowing streams with different temperatures the refractive index of liquid crystal lc can be modified by an applied electric field light beam experiences different refractive index depending on the state of the liquid crystal which is controlled by an electric field concept similar to that of grin lenses can be used for lc under the applied electric field liquid crystal molecules reorient and retard the propagating light beam lc lens can therefore be designed by the configuration of the electrodes and the corresponding electric field for more details on variable focusing lenses made of liquid crystals readers may refer to the comprehensive review by sato for common operating temperature range of digital camera between and the liquid used in micro optofluidic lenses should have low freezing point for an aqueous solution the low freezing point can be achieved by using highly concentrated salt solution for lenses based on nonthermal concepts the thermo optical coefficient dn dt should be kept at minimum value the key parameters of out of plane and in plane amicrooptofluidic lenses are summarized in tableiii and iv respectively most out of plane micro optofluidic lenses are designed as circular chamber covered by flexible membrane the membrane deforms when pressure is applied to the lens liquid the pressure can adjust the radius of curvature of the spherical membrane and consequently the focal length fig the design of pneumatically tunable out of plane optofluidic lenses was inspired by human eye ahn and kim reported lens made with conventional micromachining technology based on silicon and glass the thick glass membrane is tuned by pressure delivered by pump index matching liquid was used as the working fluid due to the high yong modulus of the lens material small deformation up to for mm lens leads to relatively large focal length from to cm the size of the lens and the corresponding aperture size and focal length can be reduced using softer material such as pdms fig werber and zappe replaced the glass membrane by m thick pdms layer the spin coated pdms can reach smoothness of about nm the lens chamber was etched in silicon with deep reactive ion etching drie and sealed by anodic bonding to pyrex glass wafer chronis et al reported lens with diameter and thick membrane the flexible pdms allows reducing the maximum radius of curvature of the lens to about mm and focal length from to mm table iii the planoconvex design of chronis et al was improved by biconvex design by jeong et al fig an even shorter focal length from to mm was obtained zhang et al used two lens chambers to vary the two lens curvatures independently fig the lens chambers are formed by sandwiching glass slide between two pdms pieces the pdms membrane is thick agarwal et al reported the same design implemented with three silicon layers the lens chambers were etched using drie m thick pdms membrane was spin coated and transferred to the silicon surface to work as the lens membrane pang et al realized the biconvex design in multiple layers of pdms this design allows the formation of three lens chambers with three independent controllable pressures adjusting these three pressures allows forming different lens shapes chen et al used similar approach as reported by jeong et al to form spherical surface in pdms the technique is based on the droplet formation of liquid polymers such as photoresists on planar surface while jeong et al used the molded concave pdms surface for the lens chen et al used the concave pdms surface as mold to make convex pdms lens the planoconvex pdms is used as the membrane for the tunable liquid lens to form complex liquid solid lens system feng and chou used biconvex and convex concave pdms lens as walls of the lens chamber to form complex pdms liquid pdms lens system fig most of the above mentioned designs use external pressure supply to tune the lens shape because of this reason fluidic interconnects and tubing are required more compact design can be achieved if the liquid is contained inside the lens chamber and the pressure is transferred indirectly from an actuator ren et al sealed the liquid in the lens chamber and applied pressure through squeezing string driven by servo motor another version used mechanical lever to transfer the pressure to the lens chamber another variation of pressure tunable lens is the double focus lens reported by yu et al the lens membrane was made with different thicknesses leading to the different radii of curvatures parallel light beam will be focused at spot and ring at different focal lengths multifocus lens can be used for applications that require optical detection and manipulation at different positions the above lens concept with deformed pdms membrane can be implemented for in plane configuration hsiung et al formed m membrane in the same molding process of the microfluidic network the lens surfaces measure and respectively with this small membrane size the deformation is not large enough to form short focal length fig in plane micro optofluidic lenses utilize the curvature formed by the interface between two immiscible liquids or between liquid and air balancing the applied pressure with the interfacial tension can adjust the radius of curvature of the interface lien et al used this concept to form smooth liquid pdms surface after curing pdms forms solid liquid at the place of lens formation the pdms surface was treated with silane to stop the capillary flow of the liquid pdms fig dong and jiang used liquid air interface in microchannel to form an in plane lens the microchannel network was formed with photolithography of photosensitive polymer sandwiched between two glass slides the channel surface was treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane liquid slugs are formed at t junction and pinched at the lens channel the relatively small radius of curvature allows short focal length ranging from to mm the short focal length makes the on chip use of the lens possible since the pneumatic pressure does not need to deform flexible membrane only low actuation pressure of less than pa is needed for tuning the lens shi et al formed curved liquid air interface with simpler concept fig due to the low static pressure required for tuning the pressure is adjusted with the flow rate flowing through microchannel this pressure works again the interfacial tension and the pressure of the trapped air in chamber the optical system consists of the micro optofluidic lens and pdms lens to minimize scattering loss due to roughness of the pdms sidewall the silicon mold was treated with layer of perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane electric actuation can be used for modulating the pressure in the lens chamber common concepts such as piezoelectric electromagnetic and electrochemical actuations can be used for this purpose choi and lee et al used electroactive polymer eap for generating the actuation pressure eap can induce high strains fig the actuation requires voltage up to no details about the used liquid and the focal distance were reported lee and lee used embedded microcoil made of gold to generate the actuation pressure the gold layer was deposited before spin coating the thick pdms membrane for the lens fig a maximum deflection of can be achieved with ma driving current no details on the focal distance were reported for this lens electric field can be used to control the surface tension that in turn tunes the radius of curvature pez et al utilized the reduction oxidation process of water soluble ferrocenyl surfactant to control the surface tension the lens is made of the solution of the surfactant filled in hole with radius of mm fig drilled in teflon electrodes are built on both side of the substrate the surface tension increases with oxidation and decreases with reduction thus when voltage is applied on the electrodes the radius of curvature on one side of the droplet decreases while the radius of curvature on the other side increases stimuli responsive hydrogel is another type of actuator that can be used to induce pressure for deforming the liquid lens dong et al used hydrogels sensitive to temperature and ph values to control the lens shape the liquid lens is shaped by the interface between water and oil water is contained in ring made of hydrogels and works as the lens liquid fig the temperature sensitive hydrogel expands at low temperature and contracts at high temperature the temperature range is from to with transition temperature of about the ph sensitive hydrogel expands in basic solutions and contracts in acid solutions the ph range is from to since this actuation concept relies on thermal diffusion and molecular diffusion the response time is relatively low compared to other actuation concepts depending on the structure of the hydrogel the response time can be reduced to zeng and jiang mixed water soluble gold nanoparticles with thermoresponsive reversible isopropylacrylamide hydrogel to make an ir light responsive hydrogel the nanoparticles have strong optical absorption characteristics of ir light making the lens tunable with ir radiation tuning with fast and effective way to tune the lens shape is electrowetting electrowetting effects utilize the electrostatic force at the solid liquid interface to reduce the contact angle between an electrolyte and solid surface the three main electrowetting concepts are continuous electrowetting direct electrowetting and electrowetting on dielectric continuous electrowetting occurs at the interface between two conducting liquids such as mercury and an electrolyte direct electrowetting is realized between an electrolyte and solid electrode the relationship between the contact angle and the applied voltage is described by the young lippman equation cos cos dv where and are the dielectric constant of vacuum and the relative dielectric constant of the electrolyte and is the thickness of the electric double layer edl at the liquid solid interface because of the thin edl only small voltage is needed for changing the contact angle of the lens however the direct contact causes electrolysis and gas bubbles in electrowetting on dielectric the electric field is applied across an insulation layer that can prevent electrolysis the same young lippman equation applies to the contact angle in the case of electrowetting on dielectric the relative dielectric constant is that of the dielectric in use and the thickness of the dielectric replaces the thickness of the edl in eq most of the liquid lenses reported in literature are based on electrowetting on dielectric besides electrostatic force and interfacial tension gravity also plays an important role for the shape of the liquid lens based on electrowetting matching the density of the immiscible liquids would eliminate the buoyancy force if difference in density of cannot be avoided the lens shape should be maintained at scale much smaller than the capillary length where is the gravity acceleration one of the first proofs of concept for liquid lens based on direct electrowetting was reported by gorman et al hexadecanethiol was used as the lens liquid the lens was positioned on gold electrode and immersed in an electrolyte functional lens based on electrowetting on dielectric was reported by berge and peseux fig the dielectric layer has radially variable thickness this design allows the liquid droplet to be centered at the optical axis and imposes circular base for the droplet the response time of this lens was ms since the lens system dynamically represents second order system the response to step change of the voltage is oscillatory increasing the viscosity of the liquid increases the damping factor of the system krupenkin reported planar electrode system only small range of focal length was estimated for this lens liu et al reported double ring electrode design the first ring electrode defines the region of the liquid lens the second ring electrode is used for actuation kuiper and hendriks reported functional lens based on electrowetting in contrast to the other designs this lens wets the sidewall allowing the formation of planoconcave lens fig the concept of wetting on the sidewall was further developed by krogmann et al the electrode system was implemented with silicon technology to allow the batch fabrication of the lens dielectrophoresis is another phenomenon that can be used for tuning micro optofluidic lenses dielectrophoresis does not need an electrically conducting liquid to function molecule of the dielectric liquid experiences net force in gradient of electric field unlike electrowetting dielectrophoresis is body force phenomenon compared to electrowetting dielectrophoretic tuning consumes one order of magnitude less power the dielectric force density can be formulated as e where and are the relative dielectric constants of the surrounding fluid and the lens liquid and is the electric field strength across the liquid liquid interface cheng et al used liquid crystal as the lens liquid with high dielectric constant the electric field gradient was generated by circular interdigitated electrode system teflon works as the hydrophobic insulation layer another version of this lens used dielectric liquid as the surrounding fluid so that the lens can be packaged inside an enclosure ren et al used dielectric fluids with mismatching refractive indices and to form the lens between two parallel transparent indium tin oxide electrodes fig relatively high voltage up to is needed to control the shape of the lens in gap of between the two electrodes curved liquid liquid interface can be formed and controlled by hydrodynamic force liquid core liquid cladding micro optofluidic system represents fluidic configuration known as hydrodynamic focusing considering symmetric system the relationship between the flow rate ratio qcore qcladding and widths of the core and cladding streams can be described by the hydrodynamic focusing theory core claddingqcoreqcladding w where is the viscosity of the fluid and represents the flow rate the widths of the streams are depicted in fig instead of using straight microchannel hydrodynamic focusing can generate curved interface in circular chamber fig the streamlines spread from source point and flow back to sink point in circularly bounded domain at source point the flow rate ratio as well as the viscosity ratio determines the opening angles of the core stream and the cladding stream consequently the curvature of the interface between the core stream and the cladding stream can be determined since each streamline path has its unique arc shape in circular chamber equation can be written in the angular form as core claddingqcoreqcladding where and the are the opening angles of the core stream and the cladding stream at source point respectively using eq the relationship between flow rate ratio and the radius of the interface can be analytically described asqcoreqcladding cladding core arctan r r arctan r r if the core liquid and cladding liquid have the same viscosity eq reduces to the same form as derived by the model of dipole flow bounded in circular domain with the known radius of curvature the relationship between the flow rate ratio and the focal length can be derived asqcoreqcladding cladding core arctan f f r arctan f f r tang et al reported the first liquid core liquid cladding lens based on hydrodynamic focusing fig the lens was formed in an expanded microchannel with parallel sidewalls because of this design the liquid liquid interface takes up the shape of the channel at high core flow rate similar designs of the same concept were later reported by seow et al fig and rosenauer and vellekoop song et al used the circular lens chamber as described above to make liquid liquid interface with perfect arc shape fig a lens chamber with single inlet and single exit can form biconvex planoconvex and concave convex lenses however it is not possible to form biconcave or planoconcave lenses with this design song et al proposed chamber design with two inlets and two exits this chamber design allows the formation of biconcave and planoconcave lenses fig these lens shapes allow focusing light using liquids with refractive index lower that that of cured pdms the common material for many reported micro optofluidic lenses equation shows that the focal length is determined by the flow rate ratio and the size of the lens chamber to form lenses with radius of curvature smaller than the chamber radius song et al placed the inlet and exit asymmetrically this arrangement leads to even shorter focal length which is often needed for on chip applications another solution for designing lens with short focal length was reported by mao et al the curved liquid liquid interface is formed by centrifugal force this paper reviews the state of the art of micro optofluidic lenses the development of these lenses attracts attention from both microfluidics and micro optofluidics research communities due to their apparent advantages in miniaturization and tunability all the lenses reported in literature can be categorized into out of plane and in plane families tunable out of plane lenses are suitable for replacing conventional lens system in imaging devices such as digital camera cell phone surgical camera and possibly intraocular lens for restoration of human vision in plane lenses can be implemented in the same system with conventional microfluidic devices therefore in plane lenses have huge potential for on chip optical detection and manipulation the two basic strategies of tunability are controlling the refractive index of the lens liquid and controlling the lens shape changing the lens liquid and consequently its refractive index would require flow control components such as microvalve and micropump since the refractive index of many liquids is dependent on temperature electric and magnetic fields these physical fields can be used for modulating the refractive index without changing the liquid the lens shape can be controlled by number of actuation concepts ranging from the simple pneumatic actuation to the more complex electrowetting actuation hydrodynamic focusing has been proven as simple concept for forming in plane micro optofluidic lenses with careful design of the lens chamber and positions of inlets and outlets it is possible to implement complex lens system with both concave and convex surfaces liquid is an advantage but also the main drawback of micro optofluidic lenses even in microscale liquids are prone to shape instability and evaporation for applications that require wide range of operating temperature designing liquid lens is challenge because almost all physical properties of liquid are temperature dependent for micro optofluidic lenses that require continuous supply of liquid streams flow control and the large amount of liquid are the main hurdles toward practical applications of these innovative devices  a multichannel spectrally resolved optical tomography system to image molecular targets in small animals from within clinical mri is described long source detector fibers operate in contact mode and couple light from the tissue surface in the magnet bore to spectrometers each containing two optical gratings optimized for the near infrared wavelength range high sensitivity cooled charge coupled devices connected to each spectrograph provide detection of the spectrally resolved signal with exposure times that are automated for acquisition at each fiber the design allows spectral fitting of the remission light thereby separating the fluorescence signal from the nonspecific background which improves the accuracy and sensitivity when imaging low fluorophore concentrations images of fluorescence yield are recovered using nonlinear reconstruction approach based on the diffusion approximation of photon propagation in tissue the tissue morphology

clinically relevant sizes unique rodent mr coil provides optical fiber access for simultaneous optical and mr data acquisition of small animals pilot murine study using an orthotopic glioma tumor model demonstrates optical mri imaging of an epidermal growth factor receptor targeted fluorescent probe in vivo imaging fluorescent molecular targets to characterize tissue pathology in vivo is an important objective with broad implications for drug development in small animals and clinical diagnosis given the availability of targeted molecular imaging agents for animal research several small animal fluorescence tomography scanners have been developed to provide volumetric images of fluorescence activity other studies have focused on the systematic development and assessment of diffuse optical fluorescence tomographic doft imaging techniques in tissue volumes relevant to human imaging if targeted probes earn clinical approval most previous work involving human breast imaging has been completed using tissue simulating phantoms though fluorescence tomography images of human breast using the nontargeted fluorophore indocyanine green icg have very recently been published pursuing noninvasive optical molecular imaging at depth implies that the interrogating photons are measured only at the tissue surface making the image inversion problem severely underdetermined and ill posed even with dense source and detector configurations the highly scattered photon field limits the resolution of diffuse optical tomographic dot images and quantitative interpretation can be difficult however researchers have found that using tomographic data acquired at discrete near infrared nir wavelengths and incorporating the spectral features of dominant tissue chromophores in the imaging algorithm improves imaging performance in general greater quantitative accuracy is expected as the number of wavelengths increases however image resolution is still relatively poor compared to many clinical imaging systems additional information may be used to guide image recovery by noting that variation in tissue optical properties can be loosely associated with the tissue anatomical structure providing an opportunity to incorporate anatomical information from highly resolved conventional imaging systems in the recovery of images of optically relevant molecules in practice standard magnetic resonance mr images have been used to guide diffusion based image reconstruction of endogenous tissue chromophores and recently of fluorescent molecules an imaging system that combines fully resolved spectra of transmitted or emitted light and simultaneously acquired mri data can provide particularly rich data set for variety of imaging applications design goal of the system presented here was the development of multiwavelength capable detection system with large spectral bandwidth providing platform to explore the limits of broadband spectroscopic tomography inside mri scanners this work describes unique multichannel spectrometer based detection system for imaging fluorescence yield in small animals and breast sized domains the system operates in continuous wave cw mode so fully quantitative imaging of tissues requires the use of frequency domain measurements obtained with separate detector system the broadband cw detection system facilitates the use of unique spectral fitting preprocessing techniques to decouple the fluorescence emission from background contamination the spectroscopic detection system directly couples into philips magnet for simultaneous mri and

demonstrated here and the future hardware integration of the two is outlined in the discussion sixteen custom designed bifurcated fiber bundles zlight latvia channel light to and from the imaging domain each fiber bundle is composed of eight long and diameter silica fibers which contact the tissue surface seven fibers from each bundle connect to the input system of each of the spectrographs while the eighth known as source fiber branches off to the source coupling system since the detection branch of each fiber bundle is fixed to given spectrograph the detected light path experiences no

elsewhere the light source is sequentially coupled into one of the source fibers using precision rotating stage velmex bloomfield ny the detector associated with the active source fiber is deactivated resulting in full spectrum measurements acquired in parallel for each of the source positions though the number of source detector pairs may be reduced for smaller domains the seven fibers in the

controlling the camera exposure times between and adds an additional orders of magnitude for total dynamic range approaching orders of magnitude this range applies to fluorescence emission measurements which are prefiltered using long pass filters in the single wheel automated filter selector described above since transmission mode measurements are not prefiltering with long pass filters the nd filters may be used selectively to further enhance the detection performance resulting in total effective dynamic range of orders of magnitude maximum camera exposure times are limited by the desired total acquisition time and may be increased to further extend the dynamic range in cases for which total acquisition time is not limited the imaging method for given acquisition

fluorophore quantum efficiency and its absorption coefficient af currently frequency domain data required for parts and are collected using separate dot imaging system used in clinical exams and described in ref pmt based frequency domain capabilities are being integrated into the spectrometer system carts to provide frequency domain and cw spectroscopic detection in single system these modifications are outlined in the discussion section mr images simultaneously acquired with optical data are used to generate the finite element domain for optical tomography image recovery mr images are segmented using thresholding region growing and manual image manipulation in materialize mimics software ann arbor mi source detector fiber optic positions are registered with reference to mr sensitive fiducials attached to the patient or animal fiber interface exported mask files are used to generate fem meshes compatible with the optical tomography modeling and image reconstruction software described in ref two methods are used to incorporate tissue structural information derived from simultaneously acquired mr images into the optical tomography reconstruction algorithm one approach structures the inverse regularization matrix based on segmented mr images this is known as soft priors approach since each node independently updates allowing the recovery of tumor regions not explicitly segmented from the mr image alternatively the hard priors approach homogenizes each segmented region and is therefore unyielding in its application of spatial guidance in the soft priors approach spatial prior information is incorporated by assuming generalized tikhonov penalty term that results in laplacian type regularization matrix to recover images of optical parameters the difference between measured fluence meas at the tissue surface and calculated data is minimized the iterative update equation for the optical properties where is the absorption coefficient is the diffusion coefficient s and is the reduced scattering coefficient pertains to steps and above and is given by m jtj mltl jt trans mmeas trans mc for the excitation and emission wavelengths and once these values are know the fluorescence yield update can be calculated af jtj fltl jt mmeas mc where in both update equations is the jacobian matrix describing the sensitivity of boundary data to the parameter of interest and is fixed fraction multiplied by the maximum value on the diagonal of jtj spatial prior information is introduced in the dimensionless filter matrix generated using mr images segmented into appropriate tissue regions based on mri contrast the hard priors approach applies stricter constraints than the regularization based implementation previously described nodal values are locked together by implicitly assuming that segmented regions in the imaging domain are homogeneous in practice the jacobian matrix is calculated on fully resolved mesh at each iteration but then collapsed into segmented regions for the inversion process this drastically reduces the update parameter space from the product of number of nodes and number of unknown properties to the product of number of regions and number of unknown properties confidence in the segmentation is critical since regions are offered no spatial latitude indeed the hard priors approach is strictly characterization based implementation incapable of detection or uncovering false negatives and therefore does not present as an image recovery problem per se the following outlines the data processing procedure for all optical data collected on the spectroscopy system c as well as additional calibration procedures for fluorescence emission measurements each ccd displays baseline offset for zero second acquisitions which must be subtracted from the raw spectrum multiple repetitions of the baseline offset spectrum were measured for each spectrometer the median of the repetitions is used as the baseline offset spectrum to be subtracted pixel by pixel assuming vertical binning of the ccd chip from each acquired spectrum this is done for each spectrometer similar method was used to correct for the dark current of the ccds dark room acquisitions were recorded for range of exposure times measured counts are proportional to exposure time the counts per exposure time slope was determined per binned pixel for each spectrometer and is used to subtract dark current from recorded spectra after baseline and dark current correction spectra are converted to counts per second detector first order correction is applied to account for heterogeneity in throughput and wavelength dependence for all optical components between the tissue and ccd detector e detection fibers input optics spectrometer optics and ccd response detectors were arranged to circumscribe cm diameter cylindrical teflon phantom with an sma connector attached to the radial center of one end light from high power tungsten white light source was focused into fiber connected to the centrally located sma connector spectra were recorded with all spectrometers usually ten repetitions and interdetector calibration factors were calculated for every vertical pixel bin total of for each spectrometer this was done for each grating and grating position to be used during image acquisitions calibration factors are stored and used to scale detected signal in wavelength dependent manner this helps reduce the influence of inhomogeneities in the ccd array and partially accounts for throughput variability between detector channels similar approach is used to correct for od filtering since the nd filters have wavelength dependent response od values for every filter were experimentally determined using the spectroscopy system for given spectrometer these values were calculated for each ccd pixel vertically binned for each grating wavelength range selection in this manner calibration file for given filter setting at given grating and wavelength setting contains values of optical density accounting for number of pixels by number of spectrometers first order interfiber source strength calibration was recorded by positioning detector at the radial center of the teflon cylinder described above the detected signal from all source fiber positions was used to determine source scaling factors for future acquisition fluorescence emission spectral fluorescence emission light is initially decoupled from the often much more intense excitation signal using long pass interference filters which provide between and od filtering efficiency depending on the filter set and the wavelength selectivity of the spectrograph grating even with these components in place light reaching the ccd retains residual signal not associated with fluorescence emission from the fluorophore target which can be significant component of the total signal especially for cases in which the fluorophore has low quantum yield or is at low concentrations in the tissue in order to further decouple the true fluorescence signals previously recorded basis spectra of the residual nonfluorophore originating signal and the pure fluorescence signal are fitted to the data each spectrograph is used to record its own fluorescence emission basis spectra and residual excitation basis spectra in controlled manner all spectra are normalized to the maximum value fitting is accomplished by linear least squares algorithm that minimizes the summations n yi af bg with respect to and where yi is the measured intensity at given wavelength pixel and are the residual excitation and fluorescence basis spectra and are the coefficients recovered in the minimization procedure and is the number of wavelength pixels per spectrum the algorithm determines the amount of fluorescence emission and excitation cross talk in the measured spectrum the sum of which best fits the data in least squares sense this procedure is applied to each recorded fluorescence spectrum total of spectra for given acquisition the spectral fitting procedure is demonstrated for two different icg concentrations in homogeneous phantom in fig in some cases the fluorescence peak has been observed to shift to longer wavelengths in large phantom volumes to account for this the minimization may incorporate the position of the peak as free parameter the resulting fluorescence emission peak is integrated to provide single fluorescence intensity measurement for given source detector pair integrated fluorescence emission measurements are calibrated in the following manner flicalib flimeas ximodel ximeas spec where the index indicates single data point or source detector pair xmodel is the intensity boundary data calculated from the images of ax and sx recovered using the frequency domain measurements from the pmt clinical system this calculated or model boundary data must correspond to the spectrometer fiber positions which do not necessarily have to be identical to those used in the frequency domain system the quotient in eq essentially provides scaling factor for the fluorescence measurements which accurately scales the fluorescence data to the fem model and accounts for inter detection channel throughput and fiber coupling discrepancies an initial estimate for the iterative reconstruction algorithm is determined using homogeneous fitting routine this procedure uses the bisection method to minimize the data model misfit assuming homogeneous distribution of fluorescence yield system an cm diameter homogeneous phantom composed of silicone titanium dioxide and india ink was used to measure the repeatability of transmission mode measurements using the spectroscopy system optical properties of the phantom were approximately and mm for the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients respectively measurements were repeated at each source detector position using the cw laser source for single vertically binned pixel array the average and maximum standard errors at the laser peak are and respectively if fiber positions were not changed in between measurements these increase to and with fiber repositioning indicating that fiber coupling is the most significant source of error in these measurements if pixels are binned throughout the laser peak the average and maximum standard errors change to and for fibers remaining in contact with the phantom and and for repositioned fibers determining measurement repeatability in fluorescence mode is less straightforward given the signal dependence on fluorophore concentration absorption spectrum and quantum yield for this study mm diameter liquid phantom containing dpbs intralipid india ink and nm icg was used to determine measurement repeatability this measure was calculated in two ways one considered only the raw data for given binned pixel array and resulted in mean standard error of and maximum standard error of for the pixel array at the fluorescence peak the second measure was determined based on the integrated intensity from the full calibration and spectral fitting routine resulting in an average standard error of and maximum standard error of it is clear that fiber positioning variability would dominate the data error for fluorescence measurements in this case however fluorescence measurement data offer unique opportunity to account for fiber coupling variability this is accomplished by calibrating the fluorescence measurements to the transmission measurements in the same geometry as described in sec iv this provides inherent stability to systematic error though is not unique to spectrometer based detection which in and of itself does not necessarily provide signal to noise ratio snr advantage over more traditional detection schemes used for fluorescence tomography the benefit of spectrometer based detection is improved separation of the fluorescence signal from background contamination providing more accurate ratio especially for low concentrations of fluorophore mm diameter liquid phantom containing dulbecco phosphate buffered saline dpbs intralipid and india ink was used to investigate the overall sensitivity of the system to icg fluorescence icg dye dissolved in de ionized di water was added to the solution to obtain solutions ranging from pmto icg the optical properties of the intralipid ink solution and were approximately and mm respectively the optical properties at the excitation and emission wavelengths were recovered for each concentration of icg from data collected using the clinical frequency domain system since the domain was known to be homogeneous these properties were determined in homogeneous fitting procedure only fluorescence emission and excitation transmission measurements were recorded for each phantom with maximum allowed camera integration time of applied to the fluorescence measurements the typical data measured across the emission spectrum are shown in fig for strong fluorescence signal and fig for weak signal the spectral fitting procedure discussed in sec iv above was used to recover the true fluorescence signal and the nonspecific background contributions as shown in and respectively additionally to quantitatively compare the spectral fitting procedure to more conventional means of fluorescence filtering the measured un fitted spectra were integrated to simulate nm long pass filtering in both cases integrated values representing fluorescence emission intensities were calibrated as per eq and used to determine homogeneous values of fluorescence yield values of fluorescence yield recovered using the two data preprocessing techniques are plotted as function of known icg concentration in fig the linear fit shown in the figure was computed using the spectrally fit data with the intercept forced to zero and indicates strong linear correlation of recovered fluorescence yield and icg concentration at concentrations above nm the fluorescence yield values calculated using data that was filtered only with no spectral fitting very closely match the spectrally fit results fluorescence signals produced at these fluorophore concentrations dominate the detected signal finding consistent with the data shown in fig however fluorescence yield values recovered with spectrally fit data maintain the linear relationship at lower concentrations than those recovered using data without the spectral separation of background contamination clearly the two techniques diverge at nm at this concentration the residuals between the recovered value of fluorescence yield and the linear approximation are and for the spectrally fit and filtering only approaches respectively as the fluorophore concentration drops below nm both techniques lose the consistent linear response observed at higher concentrations though the filtered only data show even less sensitivity to changes in fluorophore concentration at pm the residuals increase to and for the spectrally fit and filtered only data processing responses respectively below this level accurate quantification of fluorescence activity is unlikely in this phantom configuration however the spectrally fit data still show stronger response to changes in fluorophore concentration down to pm the residuals calculated at the lowest concentration measured were almost five times larger without spectral fitting clearly indicating more sensitive if not accurate response of the spectral preprocessing technique it should be noted that since fluorophore quantum yield is not explicitly known in this solution the calculated slope of the linear regression does not provide information on the actual relationship between true and recovered concentrations however the linearity itself is critical measure of system performance phantom heterogeneous liquid phantom was used to demonstrate imaging large volumes with imperfect tumor to background uptake the phantom was composed of dpbs intralipid and india ink resulting in background optical properties of mm and mm icg dissolved in di water was added to the phantom volume to obtain nm icg solution thin walled plastic cylinder was positioned between the edge and center of the phantom to simulate cm diameter tumor region the inclusion consisted of the same solution found in the phantom background although the icg concentration was elevated to providing total contrast of just over background optical properties were determined by imaging the phantom in separate frequency domain clinical system and values at nm were used for this experiment the spectroscopy system was then used to acquire excitation intensity and fluorescence emission measurements integrated intensities were calibrated to the model as described earlier and images were reconstructed using an algorithm without spatial guidance as well as the soft spatial priors implementation the resulting images are shown in fig tumor to background contrast can be deciphered in both images however the spatially guided implementation provides more accurate representation of the imaged domain inclusion borders are more clearly defined and the image represents substantially higher tumor to background contrast small animal an animal pilot study demonstrates the ability of the system to image an epidermal growth factor receptor egfr targeted fluorescent probe in mouse brain tumors human glioma tumors were implanted intracranially in male nude mice days prior to the imaging study simultaneous gadolinium enhanced mri and fluorescence tomography acquisition of the population were completed prior to irdye cw egf optical probe li cor biosciences lincoln ne iv administration nm and at intervals after injection over the course of eight fibers were used in this study and fiber tissue contact positions were determined in reference to mri sensitive fiducials on the molded mouse bed for each imaging session single coronal slice was segmented into regions using materialize mimics software the example in fig shows an mr coronal slice of one mouse after irdye cw egf optical probe administration and the resulting mr image the regionized mask was exported as bitmap file from which two dimensional mesh was generated for fluorescence reconstruction the spectral fitting technique described in sec iv was used to generate integrated intensity values of fluorescence emission from basis spectra of egf optical probe fluorescence reconstructed images with and without the use of hard spatial priors are presented in fig the conventional diffuse tomography approach makes no use of the internal tissue structure although the outer boundary of the domain was used in this case fluorescence yield values recovered using this approach are highly surface weighted showing an elevated region of fluorescence activity near the surface of the mouse head well outside the actual location of the tumor the diffuse gaussian shape of the elevated region is typical of fluorescent molecular tomography imaging without spatial guidance the use of hard priors as implemented here transforms the imaging problem to one of quantification since the recovery of the tumor region size and location is not the ultimate objective in this case the tumor region outline is given by region growing threshold of the enhanced mr image and the fluorescence recovery algorithm estimates the fluorescence uptake in that predefined region an important test will be how the hard priors implementation handles false positives in healthy regions and nontumor bearing mice introduced by incorrect mr segmentation and these studies are ongoing an mri coupled optical tomography system has been developed to image fluorescence yield in variety of tissue volumes unique rodent coil specifically developed for this system provides high resolution mr images of small animals through variety of spatial prior implementations these images provide the imaging template upon which the fluorescence activity is reconstructed the system high sensitivity low noise ccd detectors were shown to be stable and provide repeatable measurements the most significant error originating from fiber coupling errors fluorescence emission intensity may be scaled to the excitation laser transmitted intensity to account for these errors characterizing the system sensitivity to fluorophore concentration is complex given the dependence on concentration absorption spectra excitation filtering and quantum yield sensitivity results of commonly used fluorophore in reasonably sized phantom were presented and demonstrated linear response of the fluorescence yield fit to fluorophore concentration down to nm using spectral fitting data preprocessing without spectral fitting recovered values for nm and below are inaccurate and the sensitivity slope begins to flatten at these concentrations this reduction in sensitivity is also observed for spectrally fit data although the decrease in the response slope is less dramatic and does not show up until concentrations of pm below this level there is still modest response to changing fluorophore concentrations although the recovered values are clearly inaccurate this is not caused by drop in measurement snr per se as the measured signal even at pm is strong and stable but may be due to systematic bias in the spectral fitting routine itself inaccuracies in the basis spectra or the presence of contaminating signal with similar spectral characteristics to icg preliminary imaging studies demonstrate an ability to image low fluorescence contrast ratio in relatively large tissue volumes mm diameter contingent upon the availability of spatial prior information provided by the mri additionally it was also shown that quantifying the uptake of targeted fluorophore in mouse glioma model is feasible and dramatically benefits from the inclusion of structural information through the synergy of mr imaging and fluorescence estimation of the regionized image larger mouse population study is currently underway to further characterize in vivo imaging performance and quantify the variation in estimated uptake of fluorophores in tumors the work presented here required the use of separate frequency domain imaging system to obtain background optical properties and calibrate the fluorescence data to the algorithmic model this is inconvenient at best and limits many of the advantages of the mri coupled imaging system importantly the lack of fd imaging capabilities integrated into the imaging system background optical properties may not be acquired without repositioning the subject integrating pmt based frequency domain detection into the spectroscopy system is underway the rotating source coupling stage was constructed with pmt detectors in design identical to that previously reported in this configuration the source branch of the spectroscopy fibers will serve as both light delivery and pickup channels for the pmt the unique system introduced here provides rich spectral information in variety of diffuse optical imaging modes including broadband nir transmission and fluorescence at present in fluorescence mode the spectrograph system offers several advantages over filtered intensity measurements as spectrally resolved detection provides exceptional wavelength selectivity for excitation filtering the excitation contamination and nonspecific background can be dramatically suppressed to improve the ability to quantify low level fluorescence as was shown here the system may also be used in the future to acquire emission data from multiple fluorophores simultaneously contingent upon the individual fluorescence peaks being resolved well enough for the spectral fitting technique to extract the contribution from each fluorophore  solar energy is one of the best sources of renewable energy with minimal environmental impact direct absorption solar collectors have been proposed for variety of applications such as water heating however the efficiency of these collectors is limited by the absorption properties of the working fluid which is very poor for typical fluids used in solar collectors it has been shown that mixing nanoparticles in liquid nanofluid has dramatic effect on the liquid thermophysical properties such as thermal conductivity nanoparticles also offer the potential of improving the radiative properties of liquids leading to an increase in the efficiency of direct absorption solar collectors here we report on the experimental results on solar collectors based on nanofluids made from variety of nanoparticles carbon nanotubes graphite and silver we demonstrate efficiency improvements of up to in solar thermal collectors by utilizing nanofluids as the absorption mechanism in addition the experimental data were compared with numerical model of solar collector with direct absorption nanofluids the experimental and numerical results demonstrate an initial rapid increase in efficiency with volume fraction followed by leveling off in efficiency as volume fraction continues to increase sustainable energy generation is one of the most important challenges facing society today solar energy offers solution with the hourly solar flux incident on the earth surface being greater than all of the human consumption of energy in year the challenge lies in efficiently collecting and converting this energy into something useful one of the principle methods of collection is through solar thermal collectors which vary drastically in the amount of solar flux captured as well as the method for capture the most common type of solar thermal collector utilizes black surface as the absorber which then transfers heat to fluid running in tubes embedded within or fused onto the surface in this case the efficiency is limited by not only how effective the absorber captures solar energy but also how effectively the heat is transferred to the working fluid an approach that has been proposed to enhance the efficiency of collectors while simplifying the system is to directly absorb the solar energy within the fluid volume the so called direct absorption solar collector dasc the dasc was originally proposed in the as simplification to solar thermal collector design and as way to potentially enhance the efficiency by absorbing the energy with the fluid volume typical fluids used in solar thermal collectors have been shown to have extremely low absorptive properties over the solar spectrum demonstrating the necessity of seeding the fluid with some sort of particle to enhance the absorption of the base fluid for low flux collectors used for hot water heating this has been typically done with india ink suspension of micron sized carbonaceous particles in shellac for high flux collectors the particles again micron sized are suspended in falling films or seeded in high velocity gas stream traditional micron sized seeding particles for dascs suffer from particles settling out of solution clogging of pumps and valves fouling of transparent tubing and absorption spectrums dominated by the bulk material properties nanoparticles offer the potential of improving the radiative properties of liquids leading to an increase in the efficiency of dascs additionally it has been shown that mixing nanoparticles in liquid nanofluid has dramatic effect on the liquid thermophysical properties such as thermal conductivity the impact of particles on the absorption of radiative energy has been of interest for many years for variety of applications more recently researchers have become interested in the radiative properties of nanoparticles in liquid suspensions especially for medical and other applications due to the tunability of the absorption spectrum and the large potential modifications to the effective optical properties of the system recent theoretical study by two of the coauthors showed that efficiency of low temperature dascs can be increased by using nanofluids as the fluidic medium one of the unique benefits offered by the nanofluids is that when metallic nanoparticles are used which are smaller than the mean free path of the material the absorption spectrum is typically broadened while maintaining distinct absorption peak leading to further enhancement in the absorption efficiency through the solar spectrum this broadening allows the nanofluid to absorb larger portion of the spectrum but maintaining peak can allow the user to tailor at which wavelength the absorption is maximized besides the benefits to the optical and radiative properties nanofluids provide other benefits such as increased thermal conductivity and particle stability over micron sized suspensions which provide potential improvements to the operating efficiency of dasc the test apparatus was built around micro solar thermal collector that measures cm with channel depth of the microchannel geometry was selected to minimize the amount of nanofluid needed for each collector test furthermore the depth of the channel allowed for the measurement of appreciable temperature gain for the pure fluid cases while allowing large range of nanofluids to be tested where the expected amount of energy reaching the bottom of the channel would be nonzero the collector glazing is low reflectance glass of thickness mm for all experiments three different groups of nanofluids with water as the base fluid were considered graphite sphere based nm diameter nominal carbon nanotube based nm diameter nm length and silver sphere based and nm diameters these fluids were either tested in varying volume fractions or varying particle sizes to understand how these variables impact solar thermal energy collection figure shows the experimental collector schematic while fig demonstrates the uniformity of the temperature profile shortly after entering the collector figure shows representative samples of nanofluids tested the collector back surface was coated with reflective aluminum tape for all experiments with nanofluids and one of the experiments with pure water the reflectivity of the aluminum tape was measured in spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere although the tape was very smooth and we assumed the reflectance to be specular the collector was also tested with matte black paint applied to the copper plate the fluid depth was controlled with metal spacer of thickness to simulate the solar spectrum superpar lamp was used at height so that m of radiative flux was measured incident on the collector the spectrum of the lamp was measured at color temperature of providing decent approximation of the solar spectrum note the numerical model uses this adjusted color temperature to generate the irradiance spectrum the collector was illuminated at normal irradiance in all experiments the overall beam divergence was small over the small collector area three type thermocouples were mounted to measure the inlet and outlet temperatures of the fluid plus measurement of the copper plate temperature midway between the inlet and outlet ports the whole system was insulated within styrofoam block to limit heat loss from the back and sides of the collector the styrofoam block was shielded from incident radiation with aluminum so as to not absorb any of the simulated sunlight the flow rate was controlled via syringe pump and was set to ml chosen to allow measurable temperature rises for all the fluids tested the nanofluids were prepared by suspending various size shape and material nanoparticles in de ionized water to help minimize the effects of aggregation the fluids were prepared with sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant of equal mass to the nanoparticles all of the suspensions were sonicated for min prior to use in the micro solar collector due to the sonication and use of surfactant the nanofluids were often filled with air bubbles which would become entrained in the collector channel this required all the nanofluids to be degassed in vacuum chamber prior to charging the collector with nanofluid in addition the collector was taken apart and cleaned after every run with nanofluid to minimize particle buildup on the glass and back surface experimentally we focus on two parameters important to the operation of solar thermal collectors the steady state efficiency and the stagnation temperature temperature at zero flow rate the stagnation temperature difference is often used as means to determine the overall heat loss of the physical system numerical comparison of volumetric and surface based simple model can be used to show the benefit of volumetric based absorption over area based absorption although previous studies indicate the benefit of such system from collector efficiency standpoint simplified approach is used to determine the overall absorptance and reflectance for volumetric and surface based system the reflectance from the system is approximated by applying the maxwell garnett effective medium theory valid for the independent scattering assumption to obtain the effective optical properties of the nanofluid eff eff fv f f where eff is the effective dielectric constant of the nanofluid is the dielectric constant of the nanoparticles is the dielectric constant of the base fluid and fv is the volume fraction these optical properties are then used to calculate the reflectance at normal incidence at the air fluid interface using the fresnel relations neff nair keff kair neff nair keff kair where is the reflectance neff is the effective refractive index of the nanofluid keff is the effective extinction index of the nanofluid nair is the refractive index of air and kair is the extinction index of air normally equal to zero the absorbed energy is then found by solving simplified version of the rte omitting the blackbody emission term and comparing the incoming energy to the absorbed energy di dy i where is the incoming radiation after subtracting the reflected component is the wavelength and is the extinction coefficient to find the extinction coefficient the approximation of independent scattering which greatly simplifies the analysis of the scattering problem is used and can be justified with the use of the classical scattering map developed by brewster and tien shown in fig including the region for the fluids tested based on the independent scattering assumption and the approximation of rayleigh scattering size parameter the following relations for the scattering and absorption efficiency of spherical particle are used in the model qs m qa im m where is the relative complex refractive index of the particles to the fluid assuming the fluid is nonabsorbing the absorption and scattering efficiencies are used to determine the extinction coefficient fv qs qa for the surface absorber system eq is utilized instead to find the reflectance of the surface metal and the air interface where the effective optical properties are replaced by the bulk material properties the absorptance of the surface is then simply minus the reflectance this simple method allows for quick comparison between volumetric and surface absorptions numerical modeling the work of tyagi et al laid the groundwork for numerical model of direct absorption receiver that utilizes nanofluids much of this work is based on models that solve the radiative transport equation rte coupled to the energy equation for small particles suspended in gas the rte is used in this model to include the emission term in addition to the previous model which only used the extinction coefficient dii dy ib y ii where is the spectral absorption coefficient the subscript is used to represent the directional nature of the intensity representing the direction of the solar radiation and in the opposite direction of the incoming solar radiation the in scattering term is neglected in the rte due to its complexity and the fact that the scattering coefficient is extremely small in comparison to the absorption coefficient in the rayleigh regime it should be noted that the effects of the surfactant are not modeled in the current system but are expected to be extremely small in relation to the extremely large extinction coefficients created by the nanoparticles and therefore not significant the boundary conditions outlined by kumar and tien are specified in eqs and l ib l i s g i ib where is the spectral wall emittance is the spectral wall reflectance is the spectral glass reflectance is the spectral glass absorptance and is the incident spectral radiation on the top layer of the fluid the inclusion of the glass absorptance in eq is especially important in modeling the experimental setup since the color temperature of the light shifts the wavelength of peak intensity in the spectral direction where glass is more absorbing the spectral properties of the incoming light and the emitted radiation can be determined with the blackbody relation given in eq t hc exp hc kbt where is planck constant kb is the boltzmann constant and is the speed of light in vacuum the intensities are coupled with two dimensional steady state energy equation to solve for the temperature profile within the fluid t qr cpu x where is the fluid density is the thermal conductivity cp is the specific heat and is the velocity the velocity profile in this case is assumed to be independent of and a uniform velocity profile for simplicity the energy equation is coupled to the rte through the divergence of the radiative flux qr a ib y a d i the boundary conditions for the inlet and the base of the collector are as follows y t tinlet l qr k y l where l corresponds to the bottom of the fluid and corresponds to the top of the fluid and the glass fluid interface the boundary condition for the top surface is combined convection and radiation x t x t y y where is the combined convection and radiation heat transfer coefficient experimentally determined from the stagnation temperature data overall model heat transfer one factor that affects the prediction accuracy of the model is the overall heat transfer coefficient method to get an estimate of the overall heat transfer coefficient is to utilize the stagnation temperature and steady state collector temperature at zero flow rate by taking the ratio of the incoming absorbed solar energy to the difference of the stagnation temperature and ambient temperature the stagnation temperature can be used to determine the loss coefficient the overall heat transfer coefficient for the collector system ul gts tamb where is the absorbed solar radiation ts is the stagnation temperature and tamb is the ambient temperature for the collector system tested the loss coefficients ranged from m for all fluids and backing surfaces tested in addition to the basic modeling that utilizes the bulk material properties and independent scattering assumption we modified the model to include the impact of size dependent effects on the nanoparticle optical properties this modification is implemented in the numerical procedure by causing modification to the extinction and absorption coefficients in the rte as the nanoparticle dimension decreases below the mean free path of the bulk material the optical properties are modified due to the interaction of the oscillation with the boundary this effect has been modeled numerically and confirmed experimentally for nanoparticles the optical properties for metals can be theoretically modeled with the drude free electron model as shown below i where is the plasmon frequency is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave and is the damping coefficient as the particle size is reduced below the mean free path of the material the oscillations of the free electrons begin to interact with the particle boundary this effect results in modification to the damping coefficient due to surface scattering the modification is then gvfd where is the bulk metal damping coefficient is the proportionality factor set to for most cases vf is the fermi velocity and is the particle diameter this modification can be coupled with the bulk optical property data which also include the effect of interband absorption to yield size dependent complex dielectric function bulk d p d overall we modified the numerical model by tyagi et al to account for the heat loss in our solar collector and the impact of particle size that appears in the absorption and scattering efficiency as well as the modification of the bulk optical properties when the particle size is below the mean free path figure shows the experimental efficiency which is the ratio of the usable thermal energy to the incident solar energy as defined below of the micro solar collector as function of the nanoparticle volume fraction cp toutlet tinlet gta where is the mass flow rate cp is the specific heat of the fluid toutlet is the collector outlet fluid temperature tinlet is the inlet fluid temperature gt is the solar irradiance and is the collector area the dasc data are compared to conventional collector configuration where the solar energy is absorbed on black plate surface the addition of small amounts of nanoparticles results in rapid enhancement in the efficiency from the pure fluid case until volume fraction of approximately for nm graphite nanoparticles maximum improvement over conventional flat surface absorber of can be achieved with nm silver particles an efficiency improvement of can be achieved while only small difference is observed between the cnt and the graphite spheres after volume fraction of the efficiency begins to level off and even decrease slightly with increasing volume fraction one would expect this result since at low particle loadings the transmittance of water is approached and thus little heating occurs while at high particle loadings the fluid absorption is very high the most drastic difference in the steady state efficiency between nanofluids is found for silver particles between and nm where efficiency increase is observed when the particle size is halved in addition fig demonstrates similar pattern for the stagnation temperature difference again rapid increase is seen with the addition of nanoparticles but this time consistent maximum level is achieved within but interestingly the differently sized silver nanoparticles exhibit the same stagnation temperature difference by comparing the amount of solar energy absorbed and reflected by fixed depth of nanofluid versus utilizing the same material but as surface absorber the benefit of volumetric absorption can be demonstrated with simple numerical model figure demonstrates that volumetric based absorption is stronger absorber as well as having reduced reflectance over surface based system made from the same material the results of the numerical model which includes size effects as well as the overall heat loss coefficient determined experimentally in comparison to the experimental results for nm graphite nanoparticles are shown in fig the numerical model is shown to be accurate to within of the experimental results across wide range of volume fractions the efficiency and stagnation temperature behavior can be described by three effects created by adding nanoparticles to the fluid mixture in conjunction with the coupling to direct solar flux as follows drastic modification of the optical properties of the fluid peak temperatures away from surfaces losing heat to ambient and thermal conductivity enhancement the first effect is the most obvious contributor to the rapid increase in efficiency as the addition of small amount of particles to the fluid makes the clear fluid water completely opaque to the naked eye one advantage of utilizing nanoparticles instead of larger size particles is much larger absorption efficiency in comparison to the scattering efficiency the most surprising result from the experimental work is the high efficiency level achieved with the nm silver nanoparticles the model does provide qualitatively correct answer when including these impacts for the silver nanoparticles showing small increase when the size is decreased from to nm diameter as shown in fig this figure also shows that reducing the particle size further leads to an even greater enhancement in efficiency through the dependence of the optical properties on particle size the effect of modifying the optical properties is obviously important in maximizing the amount of solar absorption but it is also important in this style collector to try to distribute the amount of solar energy absorbed as evenly as possible within the fluid volume this leads to more uniform temperature profile which limits the amount of heat loss at the boundaries as well as simplifies the design by eliminating surface operating at extreme temperatures therefore the optimal collector design is one in which the peak temperature is located away from surfaces exposed to ambient temperatures ideally this would be near the center of the fluid the benefit from modifying the bulk optical properties the part caused by broadening the absorption peak as particle sized is decreased and the temperature profile explains the largest portions of the efficiency increase we believe that part of the remaining increase is due to the enhancement in the thermal conductivity from the suspension of nanoparticles which has been shown to increase with decreasing particle size and would also explain the lack of difference in stagnation temperatures between the silver nanofluids our model has confirmed that small increase less than can be achieved with reasonable increases in thermal conductivity for nanofluids these three effects acting together are what lead to the overall increase in collector efficiency observed using nanofluids as dasc has been demonstrated here to offer unique advantages over conventional collectors heating within the fluid volume limiting the need for hot surface which only transfers heat to small area of fluid and allowing the peak temperature to be located away from surfaces losing heat to the environment variability of the size shape material and volume fraction of the nanoparticles allows for tuning to maximize spectral absorption of solar energy throughout the fluid volume enhancement in the thermal conductivity can lead to efficiency improvements although small via more effective fluid heat transfer and finally vast enhancements in surface area due to the extremely small particle size which makes nanofluid based solar systems attractive for thermochemical and photocatalytic processes for example in the current geometry nm diameter particles at volume fraction have times more surface area than the bottom of the channel itself further improvements to the efficiency could be achieved by taking advantage of particle size and shape distributions to make the volumetric absorber more selective in addition by determining the optimum profile of volumetric absorption potentially such that the maximum temperature is closer to the center of the fluid one could minimize heat loss and further enhance the efficiency  circulating tumor cells ctcs and circulating clusters of cancer and stromal cells have been identified in the blood of patients with malignant cancer and can be used as diagnostic for disease severity assess the efficacy of different treatment strategies and possibly determine the eventual location of metastatic invasions for possible treatment there is thus critical need to isolate propagate and characterize viable ctcs and clusters of cancer cells with their associated stroma cells here we present microfluidic device for ml min flow rate continuous flow capture of viable ctcs from blood using deterministic lateral displacement dld arrays we show here that dld array device can isolate ctcs from blood with capture efficiency greater than ctcs at volumetric flow rates of up to ml min with no effect on cell viability circulating tumor cells ctcs and circulating clusters of cancer and stromal cells the latter forming the seed and soil hypothesis of metastasis have been identified in the blood of patients with malignant cancer and can be used as diagnostic for disease severity assess the efficacy of different treatment strategies and determine the eventual location of metastasic invasions for possible treatment there is thus critical need to isolate propagate and characterize viable ctcs and clusters to expand on understanding of the biology of metastasis enable new methods for studying the emergence of drug resistance and aid in the development personalized treatments because of the rarity of ctcs cells ml compared to other cells in the blood and the large variation in their morphology large volumes have to be processed to deliver sufficient number for statistical detection and detailed characterization of the heterogeneity much of the recent work in this area has focused on capturing cells on epithelial antibody coated surfaces in microfluidic flow channels but these devices must be operated slowly ml hr to maintain capture efficiency and viable cell recover is difficult because cells are strongly bound to the surface once they attach ctcs diameters are on average larger than other cells in blood giving the possibility of enrichment with size based separation technique circulating clusters of cancer and stromal cells are even larger up to in diameter several methods involving membrane based filtration or devices relying on inertial effects have been developed to exploit this size difference because of the need for large range of sizes clogging may be an issue with membrane based technology while the throughput of inertial techniques is limited by the heavy dilutions that are necessary to maintain separation resolution deterministic lateral displacement dld is microfluidic size based particle sorting method with excellent size selectivity adaptability to sorting multiple particle sizes and dynamic control of critical particle sizes it has been demonstrated under broad range of operating conditions sorting particles from nm to um in the method as shown in fig an array of microposts direct particles above critical size ctcs at an angle with respect to the fluid flow direction so that the larger particles become concentrated at one sidewall of the array using such an array large particles can be concentrated from an input stream and harvested at the end of the array by collecting the output fluid stream separate from the rest of the fluid leaving the array however it has never been demonstrated that deterministic lateral displacement array can process the volumes needed for selection of rare circulating cells in whole blood in times of the order of minutes here we present dld array device for ml min flow rate continuous flow capture of viable ctcs from blood using deterministic lateral displacement arrays we show that dld array can be designed such that it will isolate ctcs from blood with efficiency greater than ctcs over large range in sizes from milliliter volume blood samples in minutes with no effect on cell viability so that further culturing and analysis of the cells can be carried out the layout of the concentrator device used for these experiments is shown in fig it is composed of mm wide by mm long flow chamber filled with mirrored array of triangular posts with gaps between posts one axis of the array is tilted at an angle of radians with respect to the direction of fluid flow which should give critical size of microns unique aspect of the deterministic bump array present here is that triangular posts are used rather than circular posts which should provide for increased throughput and less clogging compared to circular posts inglis wall design is used to ensure flow uniformity near channel walls where particles are concentrated according the operating principles of dld large particles above designed critical size g the cancer cells will flow along this tilted axis of the array while carrying fluid and small particles flow in the horizontal direction defined by the array sidewalls the top section in the mirrored array directs large particles downward towards the central wall while the bottom section directs them upward this allows the device width to be doubled without increasing the array length which must typically be scaled with the array width divided by the array tilt to ensure all large particles are displaced to the central wall fluid containing targeted particles is brought in from single inlet and flowed through the array while traversing the array large particles are concentrated towards the center of the flow chamber and collected at narrow collection output while all other fluid is directed to waste outlet devices are etched into silicon wafer to depth of and sealed with pdms coated glass cover slide three devices are tiled in plane on each silicon layer and external connections are made by mating an acrylic manifold to through wafer holes etched into device at inlet and outlet ports the manifold is spring loaded to withstand applied pressures up to atmospheres without leaking manifold devices and tubing are first wet with running buffer of pbs bsa and mm edta ml of fluid was processed in each experiment at various flow rates that were controlled by syringe pump the pressure drop across the device was measured at atmospheres at ml min flow rate for buffer and scaled linearly with flow rate experiments were performed with approximately cancer cells from breast or prostate cell lines in ml of growth medium spiked into buffer or blood diluted with buffer cells are cultured using standard methods and used immediately after passage premalignant mcf and malignant mdamb epithelial breast cells contained gfp or rfp construct that allowed them to be easily differentiated from other non fluorescent cells in solution device functionality with cancer cells was confirmed by observing the trajectories of mdamb breast cells expressing gfp with epifluorescence microscopy at flow rate of min fig using cells in buffer we can clearly see that cells enter the device broadly distributed from single inlet as they enter the array and are focused against the central wall and directed into the collection output at the end of the array we confirmed the function of the dld array at high flow rate by processing mcf breast cells spiked in the wetting solution at ml min ml of growth medium with cells was diluted to ml with the wetting solution and ml of sample was processed in concentrations and size distribution of cells were measured for input collection and waste solutions using coulter counter from an initial concentration of cells ml with average size the collection output had concentration of cells ml with average size while waste output had concentration of cells ml with average size factoring in the volume of each output vc ml vw ml we can calculate the capture efficiency as the ratio of cells in the collection output to the total number of cells in both outputs documentclass pt minimal begin document frac collected cells total cells frac c c c c w w end document collectedcellstotalcells ccvcccvc cwvw using this definition of the targeted cells were collected by the device experiments were then performed with cancer cells spiked into blood to assess the potential for separating ctcs from blood blood was supplied by donors from the interstate blood bank memphis tn shipped overnight and used within one day since blood has higher viscosity than water dilution between and times was performed to ensure that the device operated below the manifold pressure limit in first experiment of blood was added to ml of growth medium with malignant mdamb breast cells and then diluted to total volume of ml with the wetting solution ml of this mixture was processed at ml min flow rate and the output solutions were analyzed with flow cytometer mdamb cells used expressed red fluorescent protein dtomato that was used to distinguish them from other cells in the mixture which had no fluorescence total cells were analyzed from the input collection output and waste output in each run and the number of large fluorescent cells were enumerated from multivariable analysis of the input cells were cancer cells while of collection output cells and of waste output cells were cancer cells if we assume that the concentrations of other cells remain constant we can normalize these percentages to the ratio of cancer cells to other cells in each solution and get and for input collection and waste solutions respectively and capture efficiency in these conditions of for ml min flow rate the fluid velocities in the device range from near zero at the post edges to s in the middle of gap between posts this subjects the cells to an high shear stress that might damage them the strength of shear forces in flow are characterized by shear rate defined as vx where is the flow direction and is the direction across gap cell viability was measured by application of trypan blue in saline at dilution to input and output samples vortexing incubating for min at room temperature and examining the resulting solution with haemocytometer passing through the dld array had no effect on cell viability in several different cell lines suspended in the running solution across wide range of flow rates in experiments summarized in table with three epithelial cell lines mdamb pc mcf at various flow rates from to ml min greater than of the cells survived in each experiment pc are malignant prostate cancer cells while the shear rates in these devices greatly surpasses physiological levels we speculate that the reduced exposure time at the higher flow rates limits cellular damage at ml min cells traverse the entire mm array in about ms this observation matches with observations of white blood cells in rotary pump that suggest shear induced damage is an integral effect over time that is cell vitality decreases the longer cells are exposed to high shear experiments done by di carlo et al to examine gene expression in cells exposed to high shear showed no significant changes as result we do not expect shear induced cell death or alteration to be significant limitation in the operation of these devices we further assessed cell vitality by culturing cells after they had passed through device approximately mdamb cells were spiked into whole blood diluted and ml of this solution was driven through single layer device at ml min red blood cells in the output from the collection channel were lysed with rbc lysis buffer ebiosciences washed with the running solution and of the resulting solution was placed into cm culture flask with ml of growth media shown in fig the red fluorescent mdamb cells attach to the surface and proliferate while there is small background of white blood cells and unlysed red blood cells the cancer cells seem unaffected the ml min flow rates presented constitute fold improvement in flow rate over the herringbone ctc chip used by stott et al fold improvement over the of min historical flow rates in dld arrays and fold improvement over more recent efforts by inglis and are the fastest reported operation of these devices with internal velocities exceeding s and reynolds number re we confirm that the size based separation functionality is preserved even outside the low reynolds number flow regime however the number density concentration of about needs to be greatly improved for rare cell capture there are several improvements that can be made to increase this number second buffer input should be added to direct cells into clean solution free from background cells in blood because this device has only single inlet there will always be background of blood cells in the collection output that may interfere with attempts to propagate cells or analyze them there are several examples in the literature that have demonstrated that cells in blood can be isolated literally free from background cells using dld arrays with buffer input although second clear buffer channel would decrease the background of non sorted cells greatly it would not increase the absolute concentration of sorted cells in the output stream the absolute concentration of sorted cells is the product of the initial concentration times the efficiency of isolation presently about times the ratio of the volume sec of fluid flow in the waste stream to the flow in the collection stream we have channels on each side feeding common collection channel but the collection channel is times the width warray of the channels in the array so it would appear that concentration should be but this ignores the dependence of the flow on the dimensions of the channels the actual computation of array conductance is complex but we can guess what it is by roughly using the thin slit approximation for the conductance length documentclass pt minimal begin document cal end document of thin slit documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation cal frac w eta frac g end equation end document h qg where is the fluid viscosity is the height of the slit is the width w for thin slit is the volume sec of flow and documentclass pt minimal begin document frac dp dz end document dpdz the pressure gradient since the channel depth in our case is only twice the width this overestimates the difference in conductance between the product outlet channels and the waste outlet channels empirically change of the exponents from w to w yields concentration of for our device since the efficiency of capture in our device is quite high the simple expedient of feeding the output from the collection channel into another array would increase the concentration exponentially mm wafer could easily accommodate of these devices in series and also allow simply scaling the device up in size with more side channels combined with narrower collection channel we think concentration enhancement of at high flow rates with very low background is easily within reach in summary these experiments showed that high efficiency capture of cancer cells from blood is possible at flow rates of ml with no effect on cell vitality by using deterministic lateral displacement arrays at flow rates much higher than used in previous microfluidic devices operating devices in parallel by tiling more devices in plane and vertically stacking devices could easily enable flow rates an order of magnitude larger these results open up the possibility of rapid collection of viable circulating tumor cells and clusters of cancer and stromal cells from the blood of patients with metastatic disease capturing and propagating viable cells from patients could allow in vitro chemotherapeutic treatments to be studied in vitro to determine which may be the most effective in vivo and allow better study of the development of drug resistance  over the past few years number of new mathematical functions have been proposed for wind speed probability density distributions the most commonly used function that has been cited in literature has been the two parameter weibull function however in recent years studies have shown that the two parameter weibull function might be inadequate in modeling the wind speed probability density distributions or independent of whether the distribution is of unimodal or bimodal nature for the unimodal distributions the inadequacy may be due to the intricate behavior of the distribution which prevents it to be satisfyingly modeled by two parameter model for the bimodal behavior the two parameter weibull function which produces only unimodal distribution is simply inadequate to model it appropriately therefore in recent years alternative functions have been suggested for both unimodal and bimodal distributions seeking more involved functions to better model these distributions this article involves the modeling of observed wind speed probability density distributions using the main body of models found in the literature namely rayleigh lognormal two parameter weibull three parameter weibull and bimodal weibull probability distribution functions one of the important steps in the evaluation of different functions is the interpretation of the statistical parameters namely slope mean bias error and root mean squared error as are presently used in this article novel statistical tool is developed in the present article using these four statistical parameters the novel tool can be used to evaluate the relative performance of models when more than one model is involved or to determine the overall accuracy of particular model for specific site the calculations are made based on the long term wind speed data collected at interval at the experimental site at edinburgh napier university the probabilistic distribution of wind speed is one of the important wind characteristics for the assessment of wind energy potential and performance of wind energy conversion systems as well as the structural and environmental design and analysis thorough understanding of the characteristics of wind regimes in which wind turbine is expected to work is prerequisite for the successful planning and implementation of any wind power project the knowledge of wind velocity distribution at different time scales and quantum of energy associated with these wind spectra is essential for the proper sizing and siting of wind energy project once the probability density distribution or alternatively known as relative frequency distribution is known the wind power density thus wind energy output can easily be obtained knowing the probability density distribution and the corresponding power density distribution one can assess the economic viability of installing wind energy conversion system at particular location therefore the probability distributions and the functions representing them mathematically have been the main tools used in the wind energy related literature as stated by ramirez large number of studies have been published which propose the use of variety of standard parametric probability distribution functions to describe wind speed frequency distributions this article involves the modeling of observed wind speed probability density distributions using the main models found in the literature namely rayleigh lognormal two parameter weibull three parameter weibull and bimodal weibull probability distribution functions the probability density and the corresponding cumulative distribution functions cdfs considered in the present article are presented in table probability density over the years large number of studies have been published that present the use of variety of probability density functions pdf to describe wind speed frequency distributions at the present time however it is the two parameter weibull function that is the most widely used and accepted in the specialized literature on wind energy and other renewable energy sources the two parameter weibull function has experienced the widest use in the specialized literature on wind energy this is due to its appeal of wide applicability flexibility and usefulness for describing the wind speed distribution several authors have indicated that the weibull function should not be used in generalized way as it is unable to represent some wind regimes such as those that describe wind speed frequency histograms which present bimodality or bitangentiality the parameters and of the weibull function have been studied for many locations however when there is no detailed measured data for particular site except for the mean wind speed some approximations may be used to assume weibull distribution the scale parameter is usually slightly bigger than the mean wind speed for values of shape parameters between and while the scale parameter is half of the mean wind speed for value of shape parameters close to also note that higher values of indicate higher mean wind speeds while the value of indicates wind stability there are several methods presented in the literature to identify the parameters of the weibull function the weibull function relates the mean wind speed vm to its scale and shape parameters thusvm k where the gamma function can be solved using the stirling approximation given by xxx ex x the rayleigh and lognormal functions were proposed as alternatives to the weibull function the rayleigh function is special and simplified case of the weibull function it is obtained when the shape parameter of the weibull model is assumed to be equal to one of the most distinct advantages of the rayleigh distribution is that the pdf and the cdf may be obtained from the mean value of the wind speed and therefore offers convenient and simple approach the rayleigh model has been widely used to fit the observed probability density distributions and its validity was shown for various locations by numerous researchers in essence the classic weibull function is theoretically not universal model or no single model could be expected to give good results at all stations since wind patterns are different due to various reasons modifications to the two parameter weibull function were therefore suggested for better results among those the hybrid weibull model slight modification to the weibull function was proposed to improve the modeling at low wind speeds three parameter weibull function was also utilized in some studies and was found to provide improved fitness and flexibility than the classical weibull function tuller and brett and xiao et al suggested two alternative pdfs to two parameter weibull namely the type extreme value distribution and three parameter weibull function xiao et al reported that although three of the pdfs are all suitable for describing the probability distribution of the extreme wind speed data the type and the three parameter weibull function are more appropriate compared to the two parameter weibull regarding the bimodal distribution there are hypotheses as to the cause of bimodal nature of the distribution for la ventosa mexico jaramillo and borja related this to two different types of winds namely mountain gap generated wind phenomenon and that caused by local effects as sea breeze thus the frequency distribution for that particular location is established by both mountain gap wind phenomenon and sea breeze winds the mountain gap phenomenon produces exceptional wind speeds due to the effect of strong cross mountain pressure gradient constituting the second mode with an average wind speed of around s the sea breeze wind however caused by the temperature difference when the sea surface is colder than the adjacent land constitutes the first mode with low wind speed potential in recent years some studies have shown that the classic two parameter weibull function may be inadequate in modeling the wind speed distributions that show such bimodal behavior thus an alternative more involved functions such as the two component mixture weibull distribution bimodal weibull have been suggested to better model the bimodal behavior of wind regimes jaramillo and borja showed that the wind speed distribution in la ventosa mexico is not represented well by the typical two parameter weibull function therefore they also used bimodal weibull to analyze the wind speed frequency distribution in that region it is reported that the analysis of wind data showed that computing the capacity factor for wind power plants to be installed in la ventosa must be carried out by means of bimodal function instead of the typical weibull function otherwise the capacity factor is underpredicted the bimodal weibull model was also used for wind power density and wind turbine energy output estimations tuller and brett concluded that their proposed bimodal model was more realistic than the unimodal probability models normally commonly used in scientific literature the bimodal probability model estimation of the annual energy generated by pitch regulated wind turbine gives closer result to the energy calculated from the sample data than estimations made through the unimodal probability models carta and ramirez analyzed the statistical characteristics of hourly mean wind speed data recorded at weather stations located in the canarian archipelago as result of this analysis they showed that the typical two parameter weibull function does not accurately represent all wind regimes observed in that region however singly truncated from below normal weibull mixture distribution and the bimodal weibull distribution provide very good fits for both unimodal and bimodal wind speed frequency distributions observed in that region and offer less relative errors in determining the annual mean wind power density carta and ramirez presented methods to calculate the five parameters of bimodal weibull distribution namely method of moments the maximum likelihood method and the least squares method they applied these methods to the hourly mean wind speed data recorded at four weather stations located on the island of gran canaria canarian archipelago spain they concluded that the least squares method provides the highest degree of fit in all the stations analyzed though the difference with respect to the other two estimation methods is not significant there is in conclusion no significant difference between the different methods employed in describing wind power probability density distributions furthermore more models were studied elsewhere including the three parameter lognormal generalized extreme value variations in the gamma family pearson type log pearson and the generalized gamma and square root normal seeking either to find more accurate models or to improve the existing models note that the weibull distribution itself is special case of the generalized gamma distribution the present model evaluations are based on the wind speed data measured at the experimental site at edinburgh napier university the wind speed data have been collected at the experimental site at the top of the school of engineering building at height of at interval total of months of wind speed data was collected spanning from august to january inclusive these measurements were made possible by grant provided under the scottish research infrastructure funding programme some of the observed probability density distributions for the available data are given in fig the monthly mean speeds vary between and s for the presently analyzed data as can be seen in fig for january which is the windiest month with mean value of s the observed probability density distribution shows bimodal behavior for this particular urban site the bimodal nature of the distribution is thought to be due to the prevailing turbulence caused primarily by the tall buildings nearby and also by the topography of the location however as the mean wind speed becomes smaller the curves become more peaked as can be seen for october which is characterized by sharp peak indicating little wind potential with mean value of s the following statistical parameters are used in the following sections to quantitatively evaluate the performance of each function presently used the slope of the best fit line given by eq between the computed and measured variables is desired to be equal to one slope values exceeding one indicate overestimation while slope values under one indicate underestimation of the computed variable pdo pd pdc pd pdo pd note that pdc is the calculated probability density pdo is the observed and pd is the mean value of the given probability density pdc or pdo the coefficient of determination is the ratio of explained variation to the total variation given byr pdo pd pdc pd pdo pd pdc pd r lies between zero and one high value of thus indicating lower unexplained variation is desirable is often used to judge the adequacy of regression model but it should not be the sole criterion for choosing particular model as in general terms the value of increases with the number of coefficients in the model the root mean squared error rmse gives value of the level of scatter that the model produces this is an important statistical test as it highlights the readability and repeatability of the model it provides term by term comparison of the actual deviation between the predicted and the measured values since it is measure of the absolute deviation rmse is always positive lower absolute value of rmse indicates better model mathematically it is given by the following equation rmse pdc pdo the mean bias error mbe provides an indication of the trend of the model whether it has tendency to underpredict or overpredict the modeled values mbe can be expressed either as percentage or as an absolute value nevertheless within data set an overestimation of one observation can cancel an underestimation of another mbe nearest to zero is desired it is given by the following equation mbe pdc pdo one of the important steps in the evaluation of different functions is the interpretation of different statistical parameters namely slope mbe and rmse as were used in the present article therefore an overall accuracy score is required to facilitate discrete comparison between different models in the present article novel statistical tool is developed based on similar tool developed earlier by muneer deriving from the fundamental concepts to give an overall accuracy score for each function using the four aforementioned statistical parameters figure shows slope that has large deviation from the ideally sought value of but high value of whereas in fig the slope is very close to ideal value but low value of is realized due to large data scatter therefore case would be preferable over case similarly fig presents smaller but systematic trend of deviation notice the negative deviations in the middle range with positive outcomes at the lower and higher ends in the case of fig an almost equal spread of positive and negative but larger deviations is noticed although case would both provide much higher value of mbe case would however be preferable over case overall it can be concluded that the slope parameter provides much more important indication of the validity of any given model the of the line fitted between computed and observed data mbe and rmse for the given model deviation provide second order information as higher values of or lower values of mbe and rmse do not warrant better model ideally the latter three parameters ought to be examined only in conjunction with the value of slope the following overall accuracy score is proposed with varying weighting factors of and for r rmse and mbe respectively r rmsermsemax mbe mbe max note that and are dimensionless unlike rmse and mbe and therefore the latter two are divided by the values of rmsemax and mbe max the latter is the largest values among all models for particular month is convenient index by means of which it is possible to compare the performance of any suite of models therefore for perfect fit the overall accuracy score will be the maximum obtainable score per statistical indicator is unity therefore overall model would have maximum obtainable score of note that this is due to the fact that the slope parameter has been weighted with factor of it should be noted that obtaining the maximum score does not necessarily imply that the model is accurate and best performing it only indicates that the model yields better results compared to the other models in the evaluation in the present study the suitability of the functions is assessed based on both probability density and cumulative distributions the latter is particularly used as alternative to the former to try to improve the quality of the fits figure presents the observed probability density distribution for october which is one of the least windy months together with the distributions obtained from the pdfs it is observed that the rayleigh model leads to distributions that greatly over or underpredict the observed distribution while the weibull three parameter weibull and lognormal functions highly overpredict wind speeds greater than and s respectively bimodal weibull pdf provides close fit throughout the entire wind speed spectrum the observed probability density distribution for january which is the windiest month together with the distributions obtained from the pdfs is presented in fig note that the observed probability density distribution for this particular month is of bimodal nature as can be expected the models such as rayleigh lognormal weibull and three parameter weibull models are unable to model this bimodal behavior leading to distributions that greatly over or underpredict the observed distribution the weibull and three parameter weibull models lead to almost identical distribution curves on the other hand the bimodal weibull function provides the best fit producing very close distribution curve to the observed data note that the bimodal weibull model provides the best fit regardless whether the distribution is of bimodal or unimodal nature the model parameters of the functions obtained from the fit of pdfs to the observed probability density distributions and the corresponding mean wind speed values calculated from the pdfs are given in tables ii and iii respectively for all the data currently studied as can be seen from table ii the rayleigh parameters of do not conform to the expected vm relationship due to the fact that the rayleigh distribution proves too approximate to the observed one however they are quite close to those of the weibull function overall the shape parameters of the weibull function are very close to for the three parameter weibull function the parameter is very close to zero in most of the months meaning that it becomes equivalent to two parameter weibull function in these cases the and parameters of the former function are very similar to those of the latter for the bimodal weibull function the first set of parameters and is somewhat different than the usual and values however the second set of parameters is within the expected limits from table iii overall the mean wind speeds calculated from the bimodal weibull function parameters are closest to the observed ones while the other models exceedingly overpredict the observed mean wind speed values the statistical parameters for fits of pdfs are presented in table iv for some of the months currently analyzed figures and show the observed wind speed distribution in cumulative format for october and january respectively with the distributions obtained from the cdfs in fig the rayleigh model provides an inadequate fit and the lognormal significantly overpredicts the cumulative frequency up to s the remaining functions provide very close values to those of observed values for the case of january the rayleigh function still significantly over and underpredicts the observed cumulative distribution the parameters of the functions obtained from the fit of cdfs to the observed cumulative distributions are given in table from table the rayleigh parameters of now are more close to expected vm relationship because the rayleigh distribution is much more close to the observed cumulative distribution than it was to the observed probability density distribution furthermore they are almost identical to those of the weibull function for the three parameter weibull function the parameters are distinctly different from zero and interestingly the and parameters of it are very close to those of the weibull function for the bimodal weibull cumulative function unlike the bimodal weibull pdf the parameter can have either positive or negative values note that positive values are usually around while the negative values are usually less than the mean wind speed values calculated from the probability density distributions obtained from the cumulative distributions are also given in table from this table it is interesting to note that compared to the mean wind values from the pdfs those from the cumulative distributions are significantly closer to the observed ones because the main wind energy related parameters such as mean wind speed or wind power density are calculated from the probability density distributions the cumulative distribution should be converted to probability density distribution the probability density distributions obtained from the cumulative distribution are presented in fig for october the probability density distributions converted from the cumulative ones for january can be seen in fig as can be seen from figs and the probability density distributions obtained from the cumulative distribution are substantially different from those obtained directly from the pdfs the statistical parameters for probability density distributions obtained from the cdfs are given in table vi for some months however it is difficult to independently interpret the individual parameters therefore as more robust indication as the goodness of different functions the accuracy score developed earlier is applied to the statistical parameters given in tables iv and vi the monthly accuracy scores for pdf and cdf are presented in tables vii ix for pdfs in table vii for cdfs in table viii and for relative distributions obtained from the cdfs in table ix as can be seen from table vii the average changes between and for the pdfs the highest is provided by the bimodal weibull function with significantly large margin followed by the lognormal function with value of the rayleigh function is the least accurate model with an overall of the weibull and three parameter weibull functions return mediocre though the former proves better model than the latter for this particular data set for the case of relative distributions obtained from the cdfs as given in table ix it is interesting to note that the three parameter weibull leads to the highest with value of followed by the weibull function with score of the bimodal weibull function achieves an overall score of the rayleigh and lognormal functions lead to the lowest scores with values of and respectively when individual models are compared for their performance in terms of pdfs and cdfs it is observed that the rayleigh weibull and the three parameter weibull functions perform better when they are fitted to cumulative distributions while the bimodal weibull and lognormal functions perform better when the fitting is based on the probability density distributions the most significant improvement occurs with the three parameter weibull function when it is fitted to the cumulative distribution while the lognormal function deteriorates most when it is fitted to the cumulative distribution in the present article an intercomparison of wind speed probability distribution models has been undertaken most of the commonly used pdf and cdf used in the literature have been included namely rayleigh lognormal weibull three parameter weibull and bimodal weibull functions needed as the most important aspect of evaluating such functions novel statistical tool was presently developed so that an overall accuracy score can be obtained for the models studied the numerical values of the relevant parameters were obtained from the wind speed data collected at napier university for period of months the most important results arising from the current work undertaken are the following not any single statistical parameter can adequately be an indication of the goodness of model composite evaluation index for intercomparing the models was therefore presently developed the question raised in recent years as to the inadequacy of the weibull function in modeling the wind speed distributions was somewhat substantiated as being correct thus and alternative more complicated functions are needed to better model wind speed distributions either unimodal or bimodal based on the pdfs the mean wind speeds calculated from the bimodal weibull function parameters are closest to the observed ones by large margin distantly followed by the lognormal function when compared to the mean wind values from the pdfs those from the cumulative distributions are significantly closer to the observed ones the bimodal weibull function returning the best prediction of mean wind speeds considering the presently developed accuracy score changes between and for the pdfs the highest is provided by the bimodal weibull function followed by the lognormal function with value of of the rayleigh function is the least accurate model with an overall of it should be noted that the lognormal model constitutes significant alternative to the weibull model as both of them have two parameters for the case of probability density distributions obtained from the cdfs the three parameter weibull leads to the highest with value of followed by the weibull and bimodal weibull functions with scores of and respectively when individual models are compared for their performance in terms of their pdfs and cdfs it is observed that the rayleigh weibull and the three parameter weibull functions perform better when they are fitted to cumulative distributions while the bimodal and lognormal functions perform better when the fitting is based on the probability density distributions orography is the study of the physical geography of mountains and mountain ranges topography in general is concerned with local detail including vegetative and human made features in this study data from one urban site were used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of number of pdf models it was shown herein that the bimodal weibull function provides the best estimates of wind speeds number of studies such as the present undertaken for variety of topographic and orographic situations will be needed to develop more generalized pattern of results those results may then be used to specify the suitability of given model or set of models for given orography or topography it is quite possible that the present findings related to the suitability of bimodal distribution to our database might be due to the presence of nearby buildings and spacing thus future researchers working on urban wind speed data may wish to explore this point further  the crystal structures elastic and anisotropic properties of ch nh bx sn pb br compounds as solar cell absorber layers are investigated by the first principles calculations the type and strength of chemical bond x are found to determine the elastic properties x bonds and the organic cations are therefore crucial to the functionalities of such absorbers the bulk shear young modulus ranges from to gpa to gpa and to gpa respectively moreover the interaction among organic and inorganic ions would have negligible effect for elastic properties the g and poisson ratio show it would have good ductile ability for extensive deformation as flexible stretchable layer on the polymer substrate the main reason is attributed to the low shear modulus of such perovskites the anisotropic indices au ab ag a and show abx perovskite have very strong anisotropy derived from the elastic constants chemical bonds and symmetry the hybrid organic inorganic halide perovskite materials such as ch nh bx sn pb br as light harvesters in solid state sensitized solar cells has led reports of impressive efficiency values of up to kazim snaith park and kim et al have discussed interplay of the physical and electronic structure of lead halide perovskites with respect to their photovoltaic applications methylammounium triiodideplumbate and related compounds ch nh bx sn pb br take structural phase transition cubic tetragonal and orthorhombic depending on the temperature kawamura et al mashiyama et al baikie et al borriello et al chiarella et al feng and xiao frost et al and brivio et al have identified the crystal structure of ch nh bx mab by experiments and density of functional theory dft calculation the electronic and optical properties of hybrid perovskites are calculated by first principles which show that they have good photon absorption ability like other semiconductors the absorption performances of perovskite solar cell strongly rely on the crystallinity and stress state of the perovskite layer and the mechanical properties of perovskite in the system are important for practical applications to understand the mechanical properties of pervoskite thin absorber solar cell subject to different x species and organic cations and to guide the applications of such as absorber inplanar heterojunction solar cells fabricated on flexible polymer substrates first principles calculations are necessary as the mechanical properties of ch nh bx sn pb br are difficult to measure experimentally in this report we have investigated the elastic properties and anisotropy of the methylammonium tin lead halide compounds first by first principles calculations our findings shed light on screening demanded properties for practical devices obtaining the key properties hard to acquire experimentally and elucidating their functionalities in photovoltaic all first principles calculations based on density of functional theory dft are conducted using the plane wave basis in cambridge sequential total energy package castep code the dispersion interactions were calculated directly from an empirical pair wise corrections proposed by grimme in terms of dft scheme in this work which is show more accurate results than classical dft the exchange correlation functional of dft was used by perdew burke ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation pbe gga the normal conserving type pesudopotentials ncpps within the frozen core approximation were employed e s s n p s br p sn p and pb p here the scalar relativistic effects have been included in the construction of standard pb ncpps the remaining non relativistic effect turns on the spin orbital coupling interaction which is beyond the capability of any plane wave code using ncpps therefore the spin orbital coupling induced mass splitting of carriers holes or electrons near the band extremes is completely neglected moreover the accurate electronic structures including band gap calculation have tiny effect in elastic properties calculation the monkhorst pack type point used in our calculations is and for pseudocubic orthorhombic and tetragonal phases respectively the kinetic energy cutoff is set to ev figure shows the pseudocubic tetragonal and orthorhombic crystals structures of ch nh bx sn pb br compounds respectively the calculated and experimental lattice parameters of ch nh bx are tabulated in table the crystal structures of different phase of ch nh bx compounds are constructed based on the methods reported in refs and the previous research shows the basic building block of the organic inorganic perovskites is the abx structure where is commonly large cation coordinated to anions the structure consists of network of corner sharing bx octahedra where the atom is metal cation tin or lead and is the hybrid anion bromine or iodine the hinged octahedral allow for wide adjustment of the x bond angle and several sets of cooperative rotations known as tilt transitions promote symmetry which shows different structures at different temperatures experimentally the organic inorganic superlattices are easily obtained by altering the combination of the organic and inorganic components in the starting solution from which the hybrids are crystallized therefore the dimensionality can be used as further degree of freedom for tuning the material properties and different disordered structure appeared at different temperatures for example three phases exist in ch nh bx compound with pseudocubic at high temperature tetragonal at medium temperature and orthorhombic at low temperature respectively moreover the complex structure defected and disordered ch nh ion lead to the phase boundary unclear using different fabrication methods from table it can be seen that the calculated lattice parameters by empirical pair wise corrections in terms of dft scheme are in good agreement with experimental values this standard dft calculation is shown to provide the geometrical structures and relative stabilities for this type of perovskites structure materials in ch nh bx sn pb br compounds the effect of orbital hybridization in abx perovskite is to drive the ion off the octahedral center resulting in alternative long and short x bonds in the basal plane that leads to variety of exotic functionalities although the organic ions are important in photonic absorption and energy conversion the electronic structure and interaction among organic and inorganic ions would have negligible effect for elastic properties the mechanical properties of ch nh bx sn pb br compounds are important in the analysis of the strain stress fracture mechanics and deformation of solid absorber layers in application we have investigated them by the stress strain method based on the first principles calculations the elastic constants cij can be obtained by calculating the total energy as function of appropriate lattice deformation the elastic strain energy is as following documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation delta v frac sum nolimits sum nolimits c ij i j end equation end document e i cijeiej where is the difference of energy is the volume of the original cell the calculated independent elastic constants of pseudocubic tetragonal and orthorhombic phase of ch nh bx sn pb br compounds are tabulated in table ii for only the intrinsic elastic constants tabled in table ii the calculation use the space group

crystals c c c c c c for tetragonal crystals c c c c c c c c c c for orthorhombic crystals from table ii it can be seen that the calculated results of these hybrid halide perovskites satisfy the elastic stability conditions c and represent the uniaxial deformation along the and direction respectively c and are pure shear deformation on and crystal plane respectively is mixture of and or the pure shear stress at crystal plane along bar direction and so on according to the calculated elastic constants the bulk modulus shear modulus young modulus and poisson ratio of polycrystalline forms are evaluated by voigt reuss hill vrh approximation as tabled in table iii the sound velocities and debye temperature in the crystal are closely hinged to the elastic properties as the following

gv and gr are the bulk and shear moduli calculated by voigt and reuss approximations respectively for isotropic structures the indexes in au ab ag and are all zero deviations from zero indicate anisotropy the calculated results are shown in table iv to better describe the elastic anisotropic behavior of different crystals we have constructed the three dimensional surface image depicted in fig the directional dependences of the reciprocal of young modulus for various symmetry crystal structure in the figures can be defined by the following equations documentclass pt minimal begin

q are the directional cosines of the new axis or direction in the transformed cartesian coordinate system with respect to the original coordinates the surface contours of the young modulus of iodides perovskite type compounds discussed here are illustrated in fig in d space for the hybrid halide perovskites compounds the most calculated is the largest elastic constant among these independent parameters moreover it is well known that the low elastic constant implies weak resistance to shear in the plane compared with the elastic properties of perovskite polycrystalline the bulk modulus ranges from to gpa the shear modulus ranges from to gpa and young modulus ranges from to gpa when comparing these values we found several evidences as following the moduli of bromide are larger than iodide for the similar crystal structure and composition the moduli of tin based compounds are larger than lead based compounds for the similar crystal structure and composition the effect of phases on the elastic moduli is not clear we suspect the different radii and electronegativity of and ion may lead to above observations listed in and the ionic radius of sn pb br and is and respectively the electronegativity of them is and respectively the length and strength of chemical bond of sn br sn pb br and pb are different among each crystal symmetry debye temperature represents the strength of the average chemical bond as shown in table iii it can be see the debye temperature of these perovskite compounds ranges from to respectively the values are much lower than most of inorganic compounds and close to the stronger organic compounds the similar argument applies to sound velocity in sum the elastic properties are dependent on the building element of and ion furthermore the critical value has been used extensively to index the ductility of material in these perovskite cases the values of g for them are larger than the critical value for orthorhombic structures g values are much larger than which show that they would have deformation and remain the properties subject to bending tensile and compression therefore the conclusion that one could draw from the large g ratio can be used in fabricating thin film absorber layer working at room temperature for large scale deformation purpose the main reason is attributed to the low shear modulus of perovskites poisson ratio referring to ductile solid is usually with large the poisson ratio is larger than for these perovskite compounds generally the larger the poisson ratio is the softer the material is for example rubber is gold copper aluminum alloy steel and glass for ionic or covalent ionic crystals their poisson ratios are usually located between and but for the hybrid organic inorganic perovskite compounds it is more like molecular crystal and it would have good ductile ability as flexible layer on the polymer substrate the reason should be the weak chemical bonds in the perovskite compounds dependent on the constructed elements due to the soft characters of these perovskites the band gap of them can be tunable easily carried by strain engineering in application the anisotropy of elastic properties is an important topic from the view of applications for the different symmetry of the crystal it has different impacts on the anisotropic properties of the ch nh bx sn pb br compounds the anisotropy of crystal can be studied from the independent elastic constants by evaluating the anisotropic factors or indexes to describe these properties the au ab ag a and are listed in the table iv the universal anisotropic index au is better indicator than other indices which can provide unique and consistent results for the elastic anisotropy of perovskite compounds due to the smaller with the related low shear parameters the universal indexes au of bromide and iodide compounds is up to and respectively the elastic moduli and au of these compounds vary largely along different orientations and the calculated ag a and values support this conclusion though ag a and determine the anisotropy of the shear modulus the values of a and are quite different from ag it seems that the very strong anisotropy of these perovskites is unstable at ambient condition except some stabilizing factors like lots of vibrations at higher temperature or doped other elements are introduced the anisotropy of young modulus was presented by plotting its three dimensional surface contour for each perovskite compounds from fig it can be seen that ch nh bx compounds show strong anisotropic properties owing to the lower than the contours of young modulus of perovskite compounds are highly distorted along the direction the calculated planar contours of young modulus at the and crystallographic planes exhibit strong anisotropic properties too the maxima of young modulus for all ch nh bx structures are determined by their principal axes the rules for different constructed element are similar as the previous discussion by using the first principles calculations based on dft the equilibrium lattice parameters elastic and anisotropic properties of ch nh bx sn pb br compounds as solar absorber layer are investigated the results show that the type and strength of chemical bond x determine the elastic properties and the interaction among organic and inorganic ions would have negligible effect for elastic properties the bulk shear young modulus ranges from to gpa to gpa and to gpa respectively we found that the moduli of bromide are larger than iodide the moduli of tin compounds are larger than lead compounds and the effect of phases on the elastic moduli is not clear we believe the different electronic properties radii and electronegativity of and ion are essential to lead to such observations the g and poisson ratio demonstrate that such perovskites layer can be used in compliant devices with very large deformation demanded the main reason was attributed to the low shear modulus the anisotropic indexes au ab ag a and show abx perovskite indicate very strong anisotropy the results show these perovskite compounds could be used in flexible polymer substrates due to the soft characters and the band gap of them can be tunable easily carried by strain engineering in application the calculated results can be used to guide future experimental works on the hybrid halide perovskites as potentially high performance solar cell absorber  the content of this review consists of the types and the parameters influencing the performance electrical and thermal and also covers the numerical analytical and experimental models of photovoltaic thermal pvt collectors the pvt systems using air and water as heat extraction agents were discussed the parameters affecting the pvt performance such as the glazing mass flow rate and influence of absorber and design types were discussed in details from the exergy analysis it was found that the unglazed collector gives better total electrical thermal exergy whereas the energy analysis favors the glazed collectors from the literature review it is obvious that the pvt systems are very useful in the future there are no substantial initiatives taken in order to reduce the cost and to make pvt collectors favorable increasing the competitiveness of pvt collectors will enhance the utilization of renewable energy devices this communication was done to ease future studies to be conducted by researchers oil is one of the dominant sources of energy in the world increase in oil prices has created an inflationary pressure in the economic field which influenced the interest rates and investments one of the wise approaches taken by scientists is introducing renewable source of energy in this case solar energy solar energy technology which is also known as photovoltaic pv technology has developed within decade there are many applications of pv thermal pvt technology such as for water and space heating solar drying building integrated skins fa ades and many more in water and space heating the systems contain pv module combined with solar thermal collector where the heat on the rear side is used for heating purposes and is not disposed of into the environment the application of pv as fa ades has been given great attention by constructors and engineers around the world the benefits of pv as fa ades such as electricity generation thermal energy and daylighting have played an important role in the development of this double fa ades technology by proper design configuration of pv integrated double fa ades could result in the increase in electrical and thermal efficiencies and also improve the daylighting effect pv thermal collectors or more generally known as pvt collectors are devices that operate simultaneously to convert solar energy from the sun into two other useful energies namely electricity and heat figure below shows the schematic of pvt collector and its component there have been many review articles such as those of kalogirou and tripanagnostopoulos and zondag that conducted studies on pvt collectors various system designs have been developed to remove the excess heat generated and to utilize it as source of energy for variety of applications either domestic or industrial applications in the present paper the details will concentrate more on the types of the pvt collectors and their related characteristics and properties furthermore the building integrated pvt bipvt collectors will be discussed systems consisting of solar energy are important for reducing the building energy consumption thus pv integrated in building known as bipv which replaces the building elements such as roof tiles asphalt shingles and fa ade elements performs similar function but at the same time it provides electricity it is noticeable that bipv influences significantly heat transfer and its effect on building cooling and heating loads the well designed ventilated walls fa ades and roofs can cater to reduce considerably thermal loads due to direct sun radiation during summer bipv with ventilated air gap and nonventilated air gap during summer and winter respectively shows that the cooling and heating loads are both reduced the objective of this work is to provide an easy literature review which is able to provide useful information on pvt technology the solar thermal collectors have been introduced since the th century however the pv cells had been produced since the price of solar cells was still high during however due to the oil price hikes the consciousness of importance of renewable energy sources has risen in many countries the pvt application projects were launched together with the terrestrial application of solar cells although they were previously considered expensive pvt collectors can be divided into four types flat plate collectors concentrating collectors hybrid collectors water air and bipvt the flat plate collector and concentrating collector diagrams are shown in figs and respectively the pv panel is attached on top of the absorber plate other components such as the insulation glass cover and the absorber plate with tubes are clearly shown the first air hybrid collector was employed by the university of delaware the hybrid collector was integrated into the building roof which was also known as solar one house in the mentioned university the collector used air as coolant to increase the irradiance of pv modules concentrators are used there has been study on pvt solar collector with compound parabolic concentrator cpc and fins by othman et al and brogren et al figure shows that the cpcs concentrate solar radiation attached to the pv cells the fins on the back of the pv panel increase heat transfer to the air and enhance the efficiency of the system optical efficiency of water cooled pvt hybrid system with low concentrating aluminum cpcs is discussed by brogren et al new miniature concentrating pv mcpv and thermal system which was to produce both electrical and thermal energies was developed by kribus et al it was developed to provide energy to nearby users which were not only small scale application the heat produced from the mcpv was not only for low temperature usage the mcpv system which was under development produced about of electricity and of thermal energy the estimated cost to develop the mcpv system was low compared to current flat plate pv figure shows the variation in the overall system efficiency for production of electricity heat and chp with the coolant outlet temperature shown also temperature ranges for potential thermal applications are shown as well it can be shown that the concentrating collectors which concentrate more solar radiation onto the pv cells yield better performance compared to flat plate collectors air type collectors versus water air type pvt collectors are differentiated by looking at their air flow pattern the differences can be seen by looking whether the flow of air is above under or on both sides of the absorber in the water pvt collectors it is also distinguished by considering the water flow customs air based pvt collector is more preferred than water based pvt collector due to its low cost and less material usage this method of extracting heat through air can be operated either by natural flow or by forced flow of air however heat extraction by circulating air method is limited because of the low density small volumetric heat capacity and small thermal conductivity of air due to these few negative effects of air based pvt system water has been used as coolant an experiment carried out by he et al showed that by adopting water as heat extraction agent the efficiency of the pvt system can be increased due to the vast benefits of pvt technology it can be utilized in many types of applications such as in buildings and other industrial applications chow et al did research on the bipvt thermal applications in subtropical hotel building they came up with computational model that was based on monocrystalline silicon pv wall on storey building they found that different designs which are the bipv pv and pv exhibit short term electrical performances but have similar long term electricity yields this means that there is no significant difference in the electricity output of the three designs due to continuous cooling of the solar cell through the external fa ade they also concluded that placing the pv panel at the lower portion of the collector could improve the system it was also mentioned that the weather conditions and the operational mode determine the effect on the productivity of pv anderson et al conducted theoretical study on the bipvt solar collector through the use of modified hottel whillier model they further validated the experimental data by testing prototype of the collector they found that there are several parameters that influence the performance of bipvt collector they also suggested way to improve the use of steel as collector coating which is by maximizing the ratio of cooling tube width to spacing this method was shown to improve electrical and thermal efficiencies from fig the reduction in the inclination of bipvt reduces the thermal efficiency further research showed that it is cost saving to integrate bipvt into the building roof than onto it guiavarch and peuportier developed and implemented dynamic simulation tool to model the bipvt they conducted case study on two typical building to evaluate the performance of multicrystalline silicon pv collector integrated into the buildings they found that the efficiency of the unventilated pv module installed on the roof was whereas the ventilated measures had they concluded that when the integration of pv with the buildings is done properly where the pv collector can be used to preheat the ventilation air the pv performance can be improved liao et al presented numerical study on bipvt based on the two dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd model they further conducted their research experimentally on full scale outdoor test facility and found that the experimental measurements showed great agreement with the cfd model simulation study on different configurations of pvt collectors was conducted by adnan et al in their study they designed seven collector designs from the simplest design of oscillatory flow design to more complex parallel serpentine flow design the simulation that was analyzed under different solar radiations and ambient temperatures showed that the spiral flow design yield the highest performance the thermal efficiency of the design is while the cell efficiency is they also suggested that the efficiency of pvt collectors can be further improved by utilizing different types of cell such as amorphous silicon cell due to its black surface experimental numerical and analytical models it is well known that pvt systems were separate systems that consist of single solar collector and pv module they were attached together and worked simultaneously to generate electricity and thermal energy the performance of pvt collector deteriorates when the temperature of the system rises the separate conventional flat plate solar collector has steady state thermal efficiency th which can be calculated from eq where the heat collected qu is given by eq th qug qu cp ti for the separate pv module electrical efficiency el is given by el imvmgac as mentioned previously the performance of pv modules decreases as the temperature increases as mentioned by zondag et al the reliability of pv module performance on the temperature is given by the following el c where is the coefficient of temperature the value of is experimental he et al carried out an experimental rig design for natural flow which was tested in the city of hefai e in south facing position and with tilt angle of from the daily tests taken on the experimental rig the electrical efficiency obtained was based on the ratio of mass of water in thermosyphon system and collector surface area ac of kg the result in fig shows that the values of thermal efficiency th were low because all efficiency terms were based on collector area which covers of the absorber surface erdil et al built hybrid system consist of pv module and solar thermal collector and tested it for energy collection in cyprus they used two pv modules at an area of about two modules were used in their experiment to provide convenience during different seasons e one module in summer in their work they used glass as glazing and water as cooling agent because of the high transmittance of the two media from the results obtained they found out that the ratio of gain to losses for thermal energy is times the electrical energy which was measured between the periods of and figure shows the time plot of thermal energy gain and electrical energy loss el the economic analysis by applying the simple payback period method resulted in that their system built costs about euro for the payback period of years huang et al carried out an experiment to compare the efficiency of an integrated pvt solar ipvts system with conventional solar water heater the ipvts was introduced with its cost saving and space saving purpose from their work they concluded that the corrugated polycarbonate panes used have good thermal efficiency further test results showed that the primary energy saving efficiency of ipvts was above which is more than that of pure solar water heater or pure pv system furthermore they also found out that the characteristic daily efficiency ns and this value was of the efficiency of the conventional solar water heater using glazed collector ns refer to fig scientists at politecnico de milan carried out program to monitor the development and performance of hybrid pvt air collector they produced simulation model to predict the performance of the system built energy balances for different components of the hybrid pvt collector namely pv cells glass panes air gap and absorber plate were used as base for developing the simulation model they built prototype of the system and acquired data acquisition with min intervals for three clear sky days comparison between the simulation model calculations and experimental results for two performance parameters namely the electrical power produced and the outlet temperature of pv collectors was obtained from the research it was shown that the performance of the pvt collector increases when nearing the warm season when the outlet air temperature could reach up to from the program they developed the tetto integrate solarizzato e integrated solar roof whereby the technology was further used in real application tonui and tripanagnostopoulos reported cheap and simple method to cool the pvt system they introduced method to effectively extract heat from the back wall of the air duct using suspended thin metallic sheet from thermal efficiency tests it was found that the modified system gives higher performance and increased the electrical and thermal outputs they further investigated two methods namely using thin metal sheet suspended at the middle and fins attached to the back wall which could improve the heat extraction from the system the validation done showed constructive results between predicted and measured data sopian et al developed and tested double pass pvt solar collector which is suitable for solar drying purposes analysis was taken based on the energy balance equations at different positions such as the cover glass flow inlet and outlet channels and back plate they also made comparisons between the experimental results and theoretical results and found close agreements between the values that were reported numerical zondag et al developed four numerical models three steady state one dimensional d and three dimensional models and one dynamical model to predict the performance of pvt collectors they concluded that the steady state model yields performance as well as the other more time consuming and models the thermal efficiency of the dynamical model was found to be and for the steady state model the small difference indicated that the dynamical effects can be neglected for accurate calculation of the annual efficiency they also reported that the and models are more easily adapted to other configurations and provide more detailed information as required for further optimization of the collector analytical dubey et al developed an analytical expression for electrical efficiency of pv module either with or without duct which is function of climatic and design parameters they considered four different configurations of pv modules which are glass to glass pv module with and without duct and glass to tedlar pv module also with and without duct they concluded that the glass to glass pv module with duct yields the highest electrical efficiency of and it also gives the highest outlet air temperature compared to other three configurations tiwari and sodha developed thermal model of ipvts system which was experimentally researched by huang et al they derived an analytical expression for the pv module and the water furthermore they carried out numerical computations for the climatic data and design parameters of the experimental ipvts value the thermal model introduced by them showed great agreement with the experimental value obtained by huang et al with clear increase in thermal efficiency of the ipvts from to due to reduced temperature because of water flow there have been number of parameters highlighted that could affect the performance of pvt collectors these parameters include glazing water or air flow rate absorber plates and design types the analyses of these parameters are as follows sopian et al developed glazed double pass pvt collector for the collector built the air first enters the upper flow channel e glass cover and pv panel next the air flows to the back of the pv panel the flow pattern is shown in fig the work by sopian et al was further developed by hegazy where he researched four different types of glazed pvt collectors which consist of both single pass and double pass collectors e models ii iii and iv chow et al conducted an experimental and numerical validation to determine the suitability of using glazed or unglazed pvt system in the thermodynamical viewpoint in their experiment six different parameters were considered and evaluated for both glazed and unglazed conditions they found that the glazed system gave better results when viewed from the energetic point if we are to maximize the quantity of either the thermal or the overall energy output whereas from the exergy analysis the unglazed gave better results increase in pv cell efficiency packing factor water mass to collector area ratio and wind velocity is found favorable to go for an unglazed system whereas the increase in on site solar radiation and ambient temperature is favorable for glazed system water or air flow rate also known as mass flow rate has great influence on the temperature decrement of pvt systems it is known that pvt collectors can work with natural circulation or with forced circulation using mechanical device such as fan or pump tonui and tripanagnostopoulos investigated the effect of mass flow rate on the electrical and thermal efficiencies of theoretically validated pvt collector they found that the pv temperature tpv back wall temperature tw and the outlet air temperature tout were reduced with increment in the air mass flow rate as more and more air volume exists to take more heat away from the channel wall which consequently reduces the pv and back wall temperatures the outlet air temperature is also reduced because of the increase in air velocity in the channel figure shows the influence of mass flow rate on those temperatures kalogirou conducted simulation using the trnsys software to determine the ideal flow rate of the pvt system built which uses monocrystalline pv cells it was found that the optimum water flow was h which is equivalent to kg for the collector area he reported that the mean annual efficiency of the hybrid system was which is higher than standard pv system of efficiency furthermore for the same type of pv cells considered e monocrystalline it was reported that the improved electrical efficiency was moreover hegazy and sopian et al in researching the performance of pvt air heaters observed that the increase in the mass flow rate reduces the pv cell temperature and the outlet temperature and consequently raises the thermal and electrical efficiencies it was also reported by chow that as the mass flow rate in the tube increases from to kg for m pv collector area the thermal and electrical efficiencies also increase see fig cristofari et al researched on the behavior of copolymer pvt collector solar system in low flow rate condition they found that running in low flow conditions allows improving the global efficiency of the total solar system hegazy included in his research proposal to optimize the energy collection for solar air heaters sahs by hegazy the optimization criteria used were applicable for the range of mass flow parameter of moreover the optimized range l opt yielded l opt he calculated that the channel depth to length of absorber plate l ratio required to maximize the energy collection rate from sahs varies from to the recommended value for the l ratio isd the optimal for conventional sahs developed which operate with regard to variable airflow rates tripanagnostopoulos et al presented design aspect for hybrid pvt systems that use water as heat extraction fluid pvt water for both glazed gl and unglazed ungl types they have analyzed the design concepts that focused on small scale applications such as family houses multiflat residential buildings and small hotels they found that the addition of the thermal unit produced good total energy output electrical and thermal efficiencies of the design concepts are shown in table in their further analyses they calculated that the pvt water systems cost payback time was reduced by times for pc si pv modules and times for si pv modules the si pv modules showed best results which need only about years in their research they suggested the use of diffuse reflector to improve the electrical and thermal output of the system literature review on available works experiments and analyses on water and air pvt collectors was presented from the numerical models it was found that the thermal efficiencies of the steady state model and the dynamical model differ by this showed that the dynamical effect could be neglected in the annual efficiency calculation from the analytical models it was shown that the addition of ducts could increase the electrical efficiency of pvt system it was also shown that using water to cool the pvt system could increase the thermal efficiency from to glazed system gave better results when viewed from the energetic point of view if we are to maximize the quantity of either the thermal or the overall energy output by exergy analysis an increase in pv cell efficiency packing factor water mass to collector area ratio and wind velocity is found favorable to go for an unglazed system pv temperature tpv back wall temperature tw and the outlet air temperature tout were reduced with increment in the air mass flow rate as the volume exists to take more heat away from the channel wall which consequently reduces the pv and back wall temperatures the optimum pvt collector flow rate reported was h which is equivalent to kg for the collector areas which gave an annual efficiency of value of optimum flow rate of kg was also reported thus the uncertainties show that further studies on flow rate are necessary pvt collectors can be further upgraded as reported in bipvt collectors which can be utilized in buildings by considering the different designs of pvt collectors the most suitable design that yields the best performance can be used and thus the performance of pvt system can be further improved from the literature review it is obvious that pvt systems are very useful in the future there are no substantial initiatives taken in order to reduce the cost and make pvt collectors favorable it was also found that proper integration of pv collectors into buildings in which the pv is used to preheat the ventilation air could further improve the efficiency of the system eventually extensive works should be taken to improve the overall efficiency of pvt collectors and also reduce their costs increasing the competitiveness of pvt collectors will enhance the utilization of renewable energy devices  in this short review we have selected three main subjects mesoporous materials ii sensing applications and iii the concept

according to concerted interactions within nanostructures for the combined subject of mesoporous sensor nanoarchitectonics we present recent examples of research in the corresponding fields categorized according to mechanism of detection including optical electrical and piezoelectric sensing preparation and functionalization of nanostructured materials have been aggressively researched in the fields of applied chemistry and physics the systems investigated usually possess three important features type of material used ii required application and iii concept of research most of the examples can be defined using combination of these parameters which effectively determine the focus of the research in this short review we have selected the following parameters materials with mesoporous structures ii sensing as an application field and iii nanoarchitectonics as the research concept in order to highlight recent hot topics in nanomaterial research involving these features the motivation for the selection of these three parameters is briefly explained below nanostructured materials which can be applied for wide range of uses should be produced in series of easy processes yielding large quantities of materials without loss of their well defined nanometric structural features mesoporous materials satisfy these conditions as is well known mesoporous materials possess regular pore arrays with diameters in the range from to nm with extremely large specific surface areas and specific pore volumes therefore sensing properties based on size discrimination can be anticipated for mesoporous materials in addition these materials can be produced using low cost material sources such as surfactants polymers silica and carbon at the same time their structural dimensions are precisely defined by the template structures such as self assembled micelles synthetic procedures mostly involve simple procedures of mixing filtration drying and calcination or solvent extraction mesoporous materials are some of the most attractive nanostructured substances having both fine structural precisions and practically available production processes from the viewpoint of applications sensing is of general importance for various functionalities because sensing events arise from some external stimuli therefore sensing can be regarded as detection of the initiating process of various functional events for these reasons we have selected mesoporous materials and sensing as material type and application parameter respectively regarding the final parameter we have here selected the novel concept of nanoarchitectonics which was originally proposed by aono this concept is aimed at producing novel functionality of whole units according to the concerted interactions within its nanostructures methods in nanotechnology generally apply separate techniques for control of nanostructured materials and systems in contrast methodology in nanoarchitectonics rationally combines and enhances these techniques as harmonized technology for construction of architectures at the nanoscale and may include combine various processes including microfabrication self assembly and semi spontaneous nanostructure processing such as langmuir blodgett lb techniques and layer by layer lbl assembly nanoarchitectonics can be regarded as concept beyond nanotechnology and can be considered the next step for nanotechnology in this short review we have combined the three main parameters of mesoporous materials the material sensing the application and nanoarchitectonics the concept as an overview of recent research in the corresponding fields for an easier understanding the examples introduced here are classified according to the sensing mechanism including optical sensing electrical sensing and piezoelectric sensing because optical signals are simple to detect optical sensing has been widely used optical sensing using mesoporous structures can be roughly classified into three categories optical response based on specific interaction ii optical probe release and iii plasmon resonance and others according to their sensing mechanisms immobilization of photoactive groups on mesoporous materials is an advantageous strategy for optical sensing jun and co workers reported turn on fluorescence sensor for cn using cubic mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride with cu cubic mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride was synthesized by nanocasting method using ordered mesoporous silica kit as hard template to which cu was added as cu no bound cu captures photo excited electrons leading to quenching of the photoluminescence of the cubic mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride displacement of cu by cn switches back on the photoluminescence resulting in turn on fluorescence sensing without interference from other anions and serum proteins therefore this sensing system can be used under aqueous as well as physiological conditions ha and co workers synthesized sensing support materials referred to as sapy conjugate unit from salicylaldehyde and aminomethylpyridine modified mesoporous silica see figure this material can be used for sensing of fe dark brown max nm at ph and cu green max nm at ph with distinguishable colour change while the absorbance maximum of the metal free sapy mesoporous silica was at nm the corresponding detection limit was approximately ppb formation of metal complexes caused an internal charge transfer ict resulting in the wavelength shift and colour change this approach is capable of screening for fe and cu in competitive media by naked eye observation li and co workers demonstrated the importance of statistical data analyses in sensing they immobilized ionic liquid receptors on silica matrix and found that lumo homo energies excitation and emission spectra and fluorescent lifetimes were significantly influenced by coupling with different counterions statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca and linear discrimination analysis lda were used for further analyses tang and co workers immobilized the aggregation induced emission luminogen tetraphenylethene onto amine functionalized mesoporous silica the materials used exhibited supersensitive fluorescence quenching to the nitroaromatic compound trinitrophenol picric acid in aqueous solution because of photoinduced electron transfer and or energy transfer picric acid molecules diffused into mesopore channels and were adsorbed to remaining amino groups through acid base interactions thus approaching tetraphenylethene groups contact of picric acid and tetraphenylethene facilitated electron transfer in addition overlap of the absorption spectrum of picric acid and the emission of fluorescent mesoporous silica at nm induced energy transfer from the excited state of the fluorescent mesoporous silica to the ground state of picric acid as result fluorescence quenching was facilitated this system can be used repeatedly after washing with proper solvents since the tetraphenylethene is covalently immobilized inagaki and co workers prepared periodic mesoporous organosilica pmo in which fluorescent biphenyl bp groups were densely immobilized and receptor bipyridine bpy units were included figure this periodic mesoporous organosilica structure provided an ideal arrangement of fluorophores and receptors because numerous fluorophores surround the receptor placed in the rigid nanochannels energy funneling into the bpy receptor from large number of bp groups in the framework of periodic mesoporous organosilica results in enhanced emission of the bpy receptor this enhanced emission can be quenched or shifted in wavelength through interactions with ionic species for example bpy emission was efficiently quenched by the addition of even low concentration of cu in contrast red shifts were observed after addition of ag hg zn cd and pd complex of cu with partially filled shell often is not emissive while complexes of ag zn hg and cd with closed shell configuration are usually emissive sun et al synthesized anionic metal organic frameworks mofs with one dimensional mesoporous channels that were assembled using triazine triyl tris azanediyl triisophthalate as predesigned size extended hexatopic ligand these materials can selectively adsorb and separate cationic dyes separation occurs based on ionic selectivity rather than the size exclusion effect in contrast to the previous examples of porous materials therefore this system enables separation of large molecules with similar sizes but opposite charges the presence of the imino triazine backbone and carboxyl groups of the hexatopic ligand also induced unusual solvatochromic phenomena in the presence of acetone and ethanol guests and co workers developed functional mesoporous silica materials that can sensitively detect trinitrotoluene through fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret for this purpose they introduced poly phenylenevinylene into mesoporous silica nanoparticles through an ion exchange and in situ polymerization method aminopropyltrimethoxysilane was also immobilized as binding site for trinitrotoluene trinitrotoluene and the immobilized amino group form meisenheimer complexes between the electron deficient aromatic rings and electron rich amine ligands through charge transfer complexation interaction the complex formed absorbs in the green region of visible light resulting in strong suppression of the fluorescence emission of poly phenylenevinylene by fret mechanism ren and co workers reported hierarchic mesoporous zeolite nanocomposites for sensitive detection and subsequent removal of hg magnetic nanoparticles were immobilized in mesoporous zeolite nanonetwork and rhodamine hydrazine was connected at the surface rhodamine hydrazine is essentially non fluorescent in its apo state because of efficient photoinduced electron transfer quenching of the fluorophore by the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the benzoyl moiety binding of hg induced drastic increase of the fluorescence intensity at nm upon excitation at nm owing to the delocalized xanthene moiety of the rhodamine group hg ion can be simultaneously removed by using the magnetic property of the nanocomposites mesoporous materials can store significant amounts of optical probe species in their nanochannels when optical probes are released upon recognition of target guest species detection events can be transformed into an optical signal eritja and co workers prepared an aptamer capped mesoporous silica for the selective and sensitive detection of thrombin they used mcm type mesoporous silica as an inorganic scaffold into which fluorescent probe molecule rhodamine was loaded the thrombin binding aptamer was immobilized at the silica surfaces which had been modified with aminopropyltriethoxysilane binding of thrombin to its aptamer removes the aptamer components opening the gates of the mesopore channels with concurrent release of rhodamine in vitro studies of this aptamer modified mesoporous silica system revealed limit of detection of nm for thrombin zhang and co workers prepared dna functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles msn for the rapid sensitive and selective detection of hg in aqueous solution figure the presence of hg at ppb level destabilizes dna hybridization resulting in uncapping of the mesopore channels high sensitivity is attributed to the selective binding of thymine rich dna with hg the latter event induces release of the dye cargo with detectable enhancement of fluorescence detection is very rapid less than min with limit of detection reaching ppb this superior sensing performance is also due to the large loading capacity of dyes in mesoporous silica nanoparticles tang et al developed protein gated carbohydrate functionalized magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles for sensitive detection of the small molecule mycotoxin aflatoxin the monoclonal anti aflatoxin capture antibody was immobilized on concanavalin conjugated mesoporous silica particles loaded with rhodamine by using the streptavidin biotin interaction separately gold nanoparticles were densely functionalized with invertase and aflatoxin with bovine serum albumin specific competitive recognition for the immobilized anti aflatoxin antibody occurred between target aflatoxin and the labeled aflatoxin on the gold nanoparticle after addition of sucrose it is hydrolyzed to glucose by the immobilized invertase displacing the concanavalin complex and uncapping the mesopore channels as result loaded rhodamine is released for detection gupta and co workers used catalytic signal amplification for the colorimetric detection of cn in aqueous media figure their system utilized catalase in tandem with fe immobilized mesoporous silica nanoparticles fe msn mimicking the enzyme horseradish peroxidase the detection mechanism is based on several steps the presence of cn inhibits specifically the enzyme catalase resulting in suppression of disproportionation of o to water and oxygen activation of the residual o by fe msns produces oxidized tetramethyl benzidine tmb which has visually detectable green colour they predicted that the limit of detection of the proposed system could be improved based on appropriate selection of reporter molecules with large extinction coefficients or which generate fluorescence upon oxidation mart nez ez and co workers prepared unique system of lateral flow assays based on antibody gated dye delivery system using mesoporous silica this test strip based lateral flow assay system was used to detect triacetone triperoxide at the ppb level with an overall assay time of to min binding of triacetone triperoxide to an antibody cap induced release of dye at the solvent front due to the flow conditions the flow transports certain amount of released dye away from the spot of mesoporous materials depending on the amount of triacetone triperoxide charnay and co workers prepared gold functionalized radial mesoporous silica nanoparticles these nanoparticles were then coated with phospholipid bilayers the resulting hybrid structure plays the role of biofunctional platform where gold metallic nanoparticles immobilized at the pore channels can exhibit plasmonic activity for biosensing sensing activity of this system upon adsorption of bovine serum albumin or for molecular recognition between avidin molecules and biotin receptors integrated in the supported lipid bilayer could be demonstrated mesoporous medium provides large surface areas and pore volumes with an accessibility to variety of functional molecules or nanoparticles preparation of multifunctional plasmonic devices would be possible through surface bio functionalization of the gold functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles langhammer and co workers developed time resolved nanoplasmonic sensing spectroscopy using mesoporous tio films in order to investigate dye molecule interaction in media such as dye sensitized solar cell device structures figure hidden interface indirect nanoplasmonic sensing enables measurement of dye adsorption kinetics even of thick in their case mesoporous tio films in this system plasmonically active gold nanoparticles were placed at the hidden inner interface between mesoporous tio layer and the support surface indirect nanoplasmonic signals could be measured simultaneously giving time resolved and independent information about the interfacial and total amounts of dye adsorbed in the mesoporous tio film the proposed measurement method also has significant potential for new insights into diffusion kinetics in porous catalyst systems gas adsorption materials and controlled release systems diffusion kinetics of several mesoporous structures has been compared in recent reports mirsky et al reported method for real time sensing of microorganisms such as bacteria and cells using photonic lamellar gratings of porous silicon for two dimensional arrays of lamellar grating the zero order optical reflectivity exhibits an interference pattern similar to that obtained for reflective interferometric fourier transform spectroscopy biosensors the signals obtained can be fourier transformed into optical thickness resulting in sensing of rather large biological objects sailor and co workers developed label free optical biosensor using porous silicon carbon composite the porous materials used were prepared by electrochemical anodization of crystalline si infiltration of poly furfuryl alcohol and carbonization adsorption of rabbit and chicken igg to the protein modified porous silicon carbon substrates was monitored by time resolved measurement of reflective interferometric fourier transform spectroscopy porous silicon carbon materials exhibited good stabilities comparable with porous tio and superior to that of porous al marsal and co workers prepared gold coated ordered nanoporous anodic alumina films for label free biosensing based on reflective interferometric fourier transform spectroscopy for improvement of sensing signal outputs thin gold layer was deposited on the top of anodic aluminum porous structures increased refractive index contrast between the nanoporous alumina layer and the analytical aqueous solution led to significant contrast in the interferometric spectrum and higher sensitivity of the structure sensing performance for detection of bovine serum albumin was significantly enhanced the superior features of regular mesoporous materials are also advantageous for other sensing methods in the following paragraphs non optical sensing systems such as electrical electrochemical and piezoelectric sensors using mesoporous materials are introduced electrical responses electrical and electrochemical sensors have been widely used because the integration of such sensing systems as electric devices is rather easy so that introduction of mesoporous structures in electric and electrochemical devices is promising approach zheng and co workers prepared mesoporous sno materials for electrical gas sensing of the systems examined sensor response increased with h concentration from to ppm and the sensor showed very fast response and recovery the response and recovery times for ppm h were only ca and at respectively in contrast very weak response for nh was found zhou and co workers fabricated mesoporous and hollow zno microspheres and investigated electrical gas sensing of ethanol and acetone at low concentrations response magnitudes increased with the test gas concentration from ppm to ppm within this concentration range the sensor did not exhibit saturation behaviors wang and co workers prepared mesoporous structures of type semiconductor cr for applications in gas sensors and lithium ion batteries the mesoporous cr in hexagonal and cubic phases showed improved performance for vapor phase sensing of ethanol acetone and isopropanol as compared with the bulk cr material high surface area thin crystal walls and narrow pore size distribution contribute to the improved sensor performance wang and yamauchi have been developing mesoporous metals and alloys that can be applied in various areas recently they developed novel strategy to fabricate mesoporous pt and pt based alloy films with large surface areas by electrochemical micelle assembly in addition programming of square wave potential resulted in formation of composition controlled mesoporous pt au alloy films these pt au mesoporous films are capable of electrochemical oxidation of glucose and so can be used in highly sensitive glucose sensors at fixed working potential dynamic amperometric responses with successive increments of the glucose concentration from to mm was observed rapid increase in the current after each addition of glucose was confirmed in all cases this mesoporous pt au alloy film system can be easily regenerated to their initial state only by rinsing with distilled water the sensor electrodes maintained their activity for glucose sensing for at least ten cycles dong and co workers reported an electrochemical sensor for discrimination of vasopressin enantiomers using split aptamer as new chiral selector where graphene mesoporous silica gold nanoparticle hybrid was used as the electrochemical sensing platform electrochemical probe ferrocene was covalently appended on poly ethyleneimine and assembled with poly sodium styrenesulfonate on the negatively charged indium tin oxide ito electrode through lbl assembly on this assembled film two bilayers of graphene mesoporous silica gold nanoparticle hybrid were further assembled with counter polyelectrolyte poly ethyleneimine with subsequent immobilization of vasopressin aptamer fragments mesoporous silica materials are capable of suppressing the nonspecific adsorption of the dna hybrid structures with graphene and gold nanoparticles have good electronic conductivity which is advantageous for the electronic transfer of probe molecules piezoelectric responses mass detection method utilizing quartz crystal microbalance qcm based on piezoelectric properties of quartz provides versatile detection for wide range of guest substances because all the materials result in weight changes upon their adsorption resonant frequency of qcm device sensitively shifts in proportion to mass change on its electrode the device sensitivity usually reaches nanogram level or better mesoporous materials often provide appropriate media for qcm sensing ariga and co workers assembled oxidized mesoporous carbon cmk with cationic polyelectrolyte on qcm plate by the layer by layer lbl assembly method sensing performances for several substances were investigated in aqueous solution frequency shift upon adsorption of tannic acid to the cmk lbl films was observed immediately after injection of tannic acid frequency shifts upon adsorption of tannic acid greatly exceed those for catechin and caffeine the superior adsorption capacity for tannic acid likely originates in interactions and hydrophobic effects based on size fitting of tannic acid to the cmk nanochannel adsorption quantities of tannic acid to the cmk hi lbl film at equilibrium exhibited sigmoidal profile at low concentrations the highly cooperative behavior observed might originate from confinement effects during adsorption which may be similarly explained by enhanced guest guest interactions as shown in figure carbon capsules synthesized using surfactant coated zeolite crystals as templates were assembled in layer by layer manner with couterionic polyelectrolyte on qcm plate that was used to detect specific molecules in gas phase this sensing system showed better detection capabilities for aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene than aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane interactions probably play crucial role in the adsorption of volatile guest in the carbon capsule film interestingly impregnation with additional recognition components can alter gas sensing selectivity the carbon capsule film impregnated with lauric acid showed the greatest affinities for non aromatic amines in contrast impregnation of dodecylamine into the carbon capsule films resulted in strong preference for acetic acid yamauchi and co workers modified qcm electrodes with size controlled nanoporous carbon particles that were used for sensing of toluene molecules the particles used were synthesized through carbonization of monodispersed zeolitic imidazolate framework crystals the qcm electrodes containing the small sized nanoporous carbon clearly exhibited higher sensitivity upon uptake of toluene vapor sensor output reached stable values within few minutes upon adsorption equilibrium interestingly large sized particles showed smaller adsorption despite their larger surface areas reduction of the particle size is probably advantageous for adsorption of toluene molecules onto the entire electrode the same team used nanoporous carbon of large surface area for qcm sensing system in this case nanoporous carbon materials were prepared by direct carbonization of al based porous coordination polymers their superior structural characteristics of significantly high porosity resulted in superior sensing capabilities toward toxic aromatic substances for example sensing capability of this sensing system for benzene is approximately three times greater than for cyclohexane and hexane despite the three have similar molecular sizes and molecular weights it is expected that graphitic carbon containing sp hybridized carbons should have higher affinities for aromatic hydrocarbons yamauchi and co workers synthesized hollow nanocubes of prussian blue pb analogue figure that can be used for selective qcm sensing and removal of cs ion the hollow particles were obtained by synthetic route based on chemical etching with assistance of protective reagent polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp this process can be scaled up to mass production for environmental remediation prussian blue materials are known to be capable of significant adsorption of cs ions further large adsorption uptake for cs ions was due to the presence of huge hollow cavity that can promote the loading capacity of cs ions the same research group also prepared continuous cage type mesoporous silica films with large spherical mesopores using polystyrene block polybutadiene block polystyrene triblock copolymers on qcm sensor plate on line monitoring of water vapors was examined in this synthesis the framework thickness and pore to pore distance can be tuned without significant size change of the original spherical mesopores which are advantageous for water adsorption tests this structural feature is also useful for both high loading capacity and slow release rate for anti cancer drug delivery or for other efficient drug delivery systems not limited to mesoporous structures pb materials are useful for the similar functions vinu and co workers reported photo induced synthesis of cooh functionalized meso macroporous carbon films this material can be immobilized onto qcm plate to provide excellent sensing capability for aromatic amines carboxyl groups were introduced on the surface of the porous carbon films using ozone treatment under photo irradiation in this approach an amine sensitive acid surface can be created without addition of toxic and or environmentally hazardous oxidizing agents such as sulfuric acid hydrogen peroxide or nitric acid in turn the same research group prepared qcm sensing systems for acetic acid using highly ordered nitrogen containing mesoporous carbon this nitrogen containing mesoporous carbon was synthesized using gelatin biomolecular precursor and sba mesoporous silica as template via nanocasting method these sensing systems are useful for the sensing of toxic acidic molecules including co and acetic acid ishihara and co workers fabricated cage in fiber type nanoporous carbon sensor selective for aniline figure electrospun nanofibrous films poly methyl methacrylate pmma containing carbon nanocage materials were immobilized on qcm sensors this hierarchic construction provides greater surface area and porous membrane structure advantageous for sensitive and rapid sensing qcm sensing systems equipped with gas flow system allowed for detection of aniline at the ppm level with high selectivity over water benzene ammonia and other chemical species aromatic amines such as aniline contained in cigarette smoke broiled meats some vegetables and emissions from industries can be carcinogenic therefore the real time sensing system shown in this example could be highly useful for cancer risk management in this short review we have collected together research examples of sensing applications using functional mesoporous materials there exist wide variety of modes of sensing because of the great freedom available in the structural design and synthesis functionalization and assembly of mesoporous materials several of the examples in this review strikingly illustrate the important features of nanoarchitectonics where structuring concepts such as mesopore formation and lbl assembly have been rationally combined since most of the construction techniques exemplified here do not require expensive facilities or unusual conditions for preparation developments of this research field will be limited only by our imaginations in addition functional mesoporous materials are also useful for removal of toxic substances and catalysis therefore we propose that by thought alone novel functionalities for mesoporous sensor nanoarchitectonics can be produced  this manuscript summarizes the feasibility study conducted for the windfloat technology the windfloat is three legged floating foundation for multimegawatt offshore wind turbines it is designed to accommodate wind turbine mw or larger on one of the columns of the hull with minimal modifications to the nacelle and rotor potential redesign of the tower and of the turbine control software can be expected technologies for floating foundations for offshore wind turbines are evolving it is agreed by most experts that the offshore wind industry will see significant increase in activity in the near future fixed offshore turbines are limited in water depth to market transition to deeper waters is inevitable provided that suitable technologies can be developed despite the increase in complexity floating foundation offers the following distinct advantages flexibility in site location access to superior wind resources further offshore ability to locate in coastal regions with limited shallow continental shelf ability to locate further offshore to eliminate visual impacts an integrated hull without need to redesign the transition piece between the tower and the submerged structure for every project simplified offshore installation procedures anchors are significantly cheaper to install than fixed foundations and large diameter towers this paper focuses first on the design basis for wind turbine floating foundations and explores the requirements that must be addressed by design teams in this new field it shows that the design of the hull for large wind turbine must draw on the synergies with oil and gas offshore platform technology while accounting for the different design requirements and functionality of the wind turbine this paper describes next the hydrodynamic analysis of the hull as well as ongoing work consisting of coupling hull hydrodynamics with wind turbine aerodynamic forces three main approaches are presented the numerical hydrodynamic model of the platform and its mooring system wave tank testing of scale model of the platform with simplified aerodynamic simulation of the wind turbine fast an aeroservoelastic software package for wind turbine analysis with the ability to be coupled to the hydrodynamic model finally this paper focuses on the structural engineering that was performed as part of the feasibility study conducted for qualification of the technology specifically the preliminary scantling is described and the strength and fatigue analysis methodologies are explained focusing on the following aspects the coupling between the wind turbine and the hull and the interface between the hydrodynamic loading and the structural response currently there are number of offshore wind turbine floating foundation concepts in various stages of development they fall into three main categories spars tension leg platforms tlps and semisubmersible hybrid systems barge type support structure has been studied but is not included in this discussion due to its significant angular motions that hinder its commercial development in general terms spar type has better heave performance than semisubmersibles due to its deep draft and reduced vertical wave exciting forces but it has more pitch and roll motions since the water plane area contribution to stability is reduced tlps have very good heave and angular motions but the complexity and cost of the mooring installation the change in tendon tension due to tidal variations and the structural frequency coupling between the mast and the mooring system are three major hurdles for such systems when comparing floater types wave and wind induced motions are not the only elements of performance to consider economics play significant role it is therefore important to carefully study the fabrication installation commissioning and ease of access for maintenance methodologies even though there have been few visionary papers on the topic of floating wind turbines significant research and development efforts only started at the turn of this century in the s researchers from nrel and mit started significant d effort with the development of coupled hydroaerotools while model test campaigns were performed at marintek in norway on spar hull the first version of the hywind spar concept the use of semisubmersible hull as floating foundation was proposed independently by fulton et al and zambrano et al the latter paper proposed design was minifloat hull the predecessor of the presented windfloat design over the past few years academic interest in floating foundations for offshore wind turbines has reached industry and significant amount of funding has been allocated to prototype development leading the effort shown in fig from top left to bottom right are the statoil norsk hydro hywind spar top left the blue tlp recent prototype top right the sway spar tlp hybrid bottom left and the force technology windsea semi submersible bottom right the windfloat hull is semisubmersible fitted with heave plates extensive technical qualification of the hull has been performed over the past years by marine innovation technology multiple studies have been performed on the minifloat the trademark of the original hull name and are published in permanent literature these include model tests hydrodynamic and structural studies along with specific tasks based on oil and gas and other industry requirements the work described herein is based on the learning from those previous studies the windfloat system described in this paper aims at enabling floating offshore wind technology by providing both technical and economical solutions its intent is to provide acceptable static and dynamic motions for the operation of large wind turbines while limiting expensive offshore installation and maintenance procedures the challenges associated with design and operations of floating wind turbines are significant floater supporting large payload wind turbine and nacelle with large aerodynamic loads high above the water surface challenges basic naval architecture principles due to the raised center of gravity and large overturning moment the static and dynamic stability criteria are difficult to achieve especially in the context of offshore wind energy production where economics requires the hull weight to be minimal the following fundamental aspects must be addressed to design such system the influence of the turbine on the floater and the influence of the floater motions on the turbine performance large body of work has been published on the hydrodynamics of floating platforms see refs and for comprehensive overviews hydrodynamics of minimal floating platform with similar substructure was discussed by cermelli and roddier wind loads on floating structures discussed in the above references are normally computed using simple relation between the apparent wind speed and loading based on empirical drag coefficients or results from wind tunnel tests in the case of floating offshore wind turbine wind load components generated by the turbine and their effects on platform motion are significant and may lead to coupling effects which cannot be accounted for using conventional methods the following methodology is applied in this paper with increasing level of refinement of the coupling effects between the wind turbine and platform motion in the first step consisting of global sizing of the floater coupling between the turbine and floater is accounted for using the following approximation the wind thrust is determined by assuming that the base of the turbine is fixed and it is applied as force and overturning moment at the base of the mast this approach is further described in ref the second step involves time domain simulations of the hydrodynamic response of the platform using timefloat software the software was modified to compute wind turbine loads based on an equivalent drag model which provides suitable wind thrust at the hub and also generates aerodynamic damping gyroscopic effects due to the gyration of the rotor coupled with platform rotations are also included this model is relatively simple to implement numerically and could also be adapted to an experimental setup in order to verify the platform motion predictions during wave tank testing of small scale model results obtained at the uc berkeley ship model testing facility are presented this model does not account for turbine flexibilities and the various control systems installed on large wind turbines which have the ability to pitch the rotor blades resulting in variable thrust and torque in order to keep the rotor speed constant and the tower stable despite variable wind velocities in the third and most advanced step the aeroservoelastic calculation software fast developed at the national renewable energy laboratory nrel was coupled with the hull hydrodynamic software timefloat to compute the platform motion and wind turbine loads including the effects of turbine dynamics and the effect of platform motion on the resulting aerodynamic forces this offers the ability to compute simultaneously the effects of the mooring system water entrapment plates as well as all wind induced loads on the turbine the methodology is similar to that of jonkman but coupling with timefloat allows accurate modeling of the nonlinear viscous forces generated by the water entrapment plates to address the influence of the floater motion on turbine performance study was performed in which floater motions determined using the approach presented in this paper were applied at the base of the mast and turbine performance was evaluated the msc adams with the adams to aerodyn interface software allows for motion time series input similar to earthquake loading the resulting forces in the various components of the turbine were compared to the case of fixed base results of this study will be published shortly as part of the design qualification process global structural analysis must be performed and structural sizing and reinforcement of the components of the windfloat were achieved the structural assessment of the design necessitates the use of methodology and design criteria that account for the specificities of the structure large wind forces and hydrodynamic loading need to be accounted for accurately in the absence of full scale experience the foundation is designed according to combination of recommendations for offshore oil and gas platforms and for fixed offshore wind turbines to ensure that the design is sufficiently conservative an extensive numerical analysis is carried out on all novel parts of the structure such as the truss connecting the columns together and the turbine tower and its interface with the hull in later phase of the project structural optimizations of the platform will be carried out to reduce overall steel weight review of the available design standards for the windfloat is presented briefly along with summary of the main characteristics of the platform and preliminary scantling of the columns sections xvi and xvii of the present paper focuses on the design of the truss and tower with finite element analysis using the full description of environmental loads on the platform from hydrodynamic analysis strength and fatigue analyses are performed the design of the tower is of particular interest since it is at the interface between the floater and the wind turbine space does not permit complete description of the system in particular wall thicknesses in various parts of the structure the intent of this paper is to not provide specific results for given geometry but rather to expose practical methodologies that can be used for design while including all significant hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loading contributions there are presently no standards specific to floating offshore wind turbines there are however rules and guidelines for offshore floaters and for offshore fixed wind turbines saiga et al had very useful discussion on the various design guidelines in the scope of this preliminary work the following documents provided sufficient information for the framework of the project we note that the iec standards are very similar to those of dnv and germanischer lloyd

os design and manufacture of wind turbine blades offshore and onshore wind turbines october the windfloat technology consists of column stabilized offshore platform with water entrapment plates and an asymmetric mooring system wind turbine mast is positioned directly above one of the stabilizing columns see fig it is comprised of the following elements three columns which provide buoyancy to support the turbine and stability from the water plane inertia these columns are commonly used elements in floating offshore platforms and one may rely on standard industry criteria such as the abs rules for column stabilized units for their design the external cylindrical shell is stiffened with regularly spaced ring girders and vertical shape stringers to provide sufficient local and global buckling stiffness to the column scantling of the structural elements of the hull aims to determine the thickness of shells girders and webs as well as the size of their stiffeners and flanges since deeper shells are subject to larger pressure loads the hull is divided horizontally into four sections that are sized according to their largest head overflow this helps reduce the amount of steel required to build the columns it is important to note that such rules have been designed to extremely low failure rates for structures undergoing heavy operational burden such as the mobile drilling units constraints include the ability to withstand collisions with supply vessels the ability to support heavy equipment including rotating machinery and frequent moves over large distances these will undoubtedly result in overly conservative scantlings for offshore renewable energy systems further studies will be aimed at minimizing structural weight while ensuring sufficient robustness and will require extensive use of reliability analysis horizontal plates at the bottom of the columns which increase the added mass hence shift the natural period away from the wave energy and increase the viscous damping in roll pitch and heave stiffeners cantilevered from the bottom of the columns with bracing tying these stiffeners back to the columns support the plates the water entrapment plates provide additional hydrodynamic inertia to the structure due to the large amount of water displaced as the platform moves in addition vortices generated at the edge of the plates generate large damping forces that further impede platform motion structural design of the water entrapment plates at the keel had to be carried out numerically since design codes do not provide specific guidelines for such components the authors have performed finite element analysis of the heave plates for variety of projects including minimal water injection platform for deep water marginal oil and gas fields which is similar in payload and displacement and whose water entrapment plates have the same edge length and surface area the results described by aubault et al are used to determine the size of stiffeners and stringers on the water entrapment plate as illustrated in fig permanent water ballast inside the bottom of the columns to lower the platform to its target operational draft once installed an active ballast system moves water from column to column to compensate for the mean wind loading on the turbine this movable ballast compensates for significant changes in wind speed and directions it aims at keeping the mast vertical to improve the turbine performance up to ton of ballast water can be transferred in approximately min using two independent flow paths with redundant pumping capability the active ballast compartment is located in the upper half of each column the damage design case includes the possibility of all the active ballast water being in the worse compartment six mooring lines made of conventional components drag embedment anchors chains shackles fairleads and chain jacks an offshore wind turbine with as little requalification that is possible from existing fixed offshore turbines the tower is made of number of sections with tapered diameter and constant wall thickness that are welded together at its lower end the turbine tower extends into the column in order to maximize continuity of the structure leading to minimized stress concentration in critical areas of the structure where bending moments are highest due to wind induced overturning moment and where large tubulars connect to the other stabilizing columns the connection is located above the wave zone with clearance above the largest wave crests the tower diameter is smaller than the column heavily stiffened top of column section is designed to carry the tower loads into the column shell the yaw bearing is installed at the top of the tower and keeps the turbine headed into the wind the windfloat in its described configuration in this paper has dimensions listed in table we note that this is not final design and that each specific wind farm being subjected to different wind and wave environments will have variations from this configuration it is also noted that the present design has significant safety margins subsequent design work was performed by the authors since these initial studies indicate that the hull presented in this paper has the capability to support the loading forces of what can be expected of typical wind turbines with rated power up to mw the stabilizing columns are spread out forming an equilateral triangle between the three column centers boat landing is installed on one or two of these columns to access the structure the columns are interconnected with truss structure composed of main beams connecting columns and bracings connecting main beams to columns or other main beams minimal deck space is required between the tops of the columns figure shows gangway connecting one column to the next and is the main deck element additional areas may be used to support secondary structures such as auxiliary solar cells and to provide access around the wind turbine mast the height of the deck is positioned such that the highest expected wave crests will not damage deck equipment or the turbine blades the structure is anchored to the seabed using conventional mooring lines arranged in an asymmetrical fashion the turbine supporting tower is carrying more mooring lines than the other two the philosophy of the windfloat is to accommodate turbines from different manufacturers it is therefore important to work with the turbine manufacturers and use their data to optimize the design figure shows typical turbine thrust loading on the tower as function of wind speed this is very useful information which is used to understand the mean force and the moment the turbine will apply on the top of the column and is key driver to the sizing of the hull figure shows typical turbine rated power as function of wind speed this information is necessary to predict the total amount of electricity that the turbine will produce when it is linked directly with the wind data for specific site in the initial phase of this feasibility study conservative assumptions were made to develop the platform global sizing it was assumed that the wind induced thrust at the top of the mast could be estimated based on drag coefficient applied to the overall area covered by the rotor e ft diameter disk the selected drag coefficient was for wind speeds up to s and thereafter up to s wind the turbine was assumed parked for higher wind speeds this model is conservative and has been being significantly improved since these studies nrel turbine code fast has been integrated with mi s floating body motion prediction code timefloat fully coupled simulations can be performed to better understand the influence of hull motions on the turbine and vice versa the turbine and mast main specifics for mw turbine are listed in table ii these numbers are specific to manufacturer but most large turbines of the same size are very similar with respect to principal weights and dimensions currently two concurrent sites are being evaluated for the windfloat first the west coast of the s from northern california to washington second the atlantic coast of portugal in both cases the wind resources are acceptable for wind farm development and the wave conditions are quite severe this paper focuses on the windfloat design performed for the western s site detailed metocean analysis was performed for the site shown in figure years of wind and wave data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa buoy were used for the analysis the windfloat is envisioned to be located km miles offshore so as to minimize risks nuisance to the general public and to mitigate the view impact from the coastline the water depth is assumed to be ft the windfloat is intended to be suitable for open ocean locations with relatively harsh metocean conditions over wide range of water depths and most likely will be cost efficient at or beyond water depths in this design phase the conditions assumed are those of northern california as shown in fig this location was chosen in an early assessment based on the good wind resources and the geographical proximity of humboldt bay the metocean conditions north of the eureka site oregon washington will be typical of the eureka site but will most likely have slightly larger significant wave height hs value there are number of noaa buoys that can be used to derive the exact extreme conditions and will be used in the detail design of specific project from the wave data three design sea states were defined an operational case is shown in table iii an extreme sea state with wind gust as defined in gl design guidelines and shown in table iv and the year storm shown in table the extreme wave event assumes year return period in keeping with common practice from the offshore industry it is noted that offshore wind turbine codes such as germanischer lloyd guideline for the certification of offshore wind turbines only require year return period events to be considered for design although likelihood of failure of an offshore wind turbine foundation may be comparable to that of an offshore platform the consequences are far less severe because they are unmanned structures and do not have the potential for large pollutions in the context of this feasibility study year return period events were considered for preliminary design this offers an element of robustness which is useful since the design typically evolves significantly at this early stage once the project feasibility has been demonstrated reliability study will be conducted to set the final criteria for the design of an offshore wind farm with the objective of minimizing the overall project cost the data were also processed to find out if there are any directional effects between the wind and waves it was remarked that the wind and waves are collinear when they are both coming from the north however when the wind came from the south the waves had tendency to come from the west hence directional criteria are shown in table vi the operational requirements provided in this section are typical of an offshore floater they form the basis of the initial design to be carried out as development work progresses further as base case the windfloat is assumed to be permanently moored using conventional anchoring system made of chain jack chain and wire sections and an anchor that means the windfloat will not be disconnected in case of extreme weather conditions the main purpose of the windfloat is to generate electricity from the wind turbine therefore the windfloat should be designed to maximize the amount of time the turbine is operational since existing turbines stop operating at s wind speed it is desirable for the wave induced motions in waves typical of those wind speeds not to interfere with this operational limit it is anticipated that the turbine may need to be strengthened to survive extreme storms in their parked positions due to the additional inertial accelerations caused by the wave induced motions closed loop active ballast system is designed to compensate for the mean wind force and direction water needs to be moved between columns such that the mast remains vertical hence optimizing electricity production it is not envisioned that this active ballast system compensates for the dynamic motions of the floater as it should have response time of between and min in rapidly changing wind conditions including wind turbulence pitching of the blades reduction in thrust is performed to help minimize the wind induced trim if necessary the response time for this mode is of the order of minutes or less the windfloat is designed to withstand very significant storms without failure borrowing from the requirements for oil and gas platforms the windfloat hull was designed for the year return storm at the site there are three separate regimes for the turbine that are wind speed dependent the blades are optimally pitched to maximize electricity production the blades are pitched as to minimize the loading on the blades but the turbine keeps spinning the rotor is not spinning and the turbine is either idling or locked down in survival mode depending on the severity of the environment this is typical of large wind turbines however as the platform moves in large waves one must recognize that regime may occur sooner than expected due to the windfloat wave response as part of the turbine qualification work specific turbine operational envelope must be defined the philosophy behind the emergency shut down system is to preserve the structure and minimize the loss of equipment since the platform is normally unmanned both automated and remote shut down procedures must be in place the following points are nonexhaustive list of key actions that should trigger series of checks and possible shutdown of the turbine failure of the active ballast system noted by either large mean pitch that does not diminish coupled with an abnormal power requirement of the pumps water leaks in column noted by heel of the platform into that column which cannot be compensated by the functioning active ballast system large accelerations measured in the turbine which would induce stresses above the design threshold inability for the turbine to rotate into the wind noted by discrepancy between the measured wind direction and the turbine heading power failure loss of communication between the windfloat and the remote operator there should be enough backup power available on the windfloat to complete an emergency shutdown procedure and keep emergency and safety systems such as navigation lights operational until maintenance can be performed there are very strong synergies between the windfloat hull and the minifloat oil and gas platform in terms of fabrication installation and commissioning the minifloat design philosophy is to optimize the economics by reducing cost in all phases of the project the same philosophy is applied here and design decisions are made after clearly understanding their impact to all stages of the process the mast and turbine are fully integrated with the platform at quayside during fabrication the platform is then towed to its installation site using tugboat due to its exceptional stability performance this operation can be conducted with minimal restrictions on weather conditions unlike fixed offshore wind foundations there is no requirement in lifting the turbine at the offshore installation site which was proven to be difficult and costly such heavy lift operations for mw turbines have been performed from floating heavy lift vessels in summer in the north sea but have been limited to ft seas and hence almost impossible off the northern california coast with the proposed windfloat floating platform integration of the mast turbine and platform is performed at quayside and on site operations consist only of deploying mooring lines and connecting to the platform in the case of an unexpected failure of the wind turbine the installation sequence can be reversed and the platform towed back to port for repairs the fabrication site should meet the following requirements the structure should be designed to minimize welding at the assembly yard by providing large preassembled cylindrical sections of the columns which can be efficiently fabricated in workshop using automatic welding machines it should be in the vicinity of waterway deep enough to allow for the windfloat to be towed at transit draft to the open ocean the windfloat is designed to be stable at its transit draft temporary buoyancy may be attached to the column carrying the turbine to accommodate the depth of the channel the mast nacelle and turbine should be installed at quayside this implies the use of large crane the means of loading out the hull from the integration site into the water should be considered early on when considering specific yards possible solutions are single lift from heavy lift crane dry dock graving dock or submersible barges the transit phase studies should address the following points the platform is towed after precommissioning to avoid the large cost and risk of placing the tower and turbine onto floater in open water if buoyancy module is needed to get out of the fabrication yard then it should be removed as soon as practical and the platform can be ballasted down to be even keel with approximately ft draft the transit route should be as short as possible which means that the location of the fabrication yard is project specific this is important especially since an offshore wind farm will be comprised of multiple windfloat units and each hull has to be towed proper selection of the installation vessel is fundamental to project economics the benefits of using the same vessel with the ability to perform the mooring installation the towing of the windfloat platforms and the power cable installation could be significant it is important to minimize the offshore commissioning phase since offshore operations including mobilization of people and vessels offshore are very expensive the following points are important to keep the cost down the mooring system needs to be prelaid and ready to be connected the anchor handling vessel recovers the messenger lines from the platform and pulls in the chain section of the mooring line the connection to the wire section is done above the water tensioning of the mooring lines should be done from the platform with chain jacks space limitations on the column supporting the tower and turbine should be considered carefully since the turbine will be already installed the procedure involved to start up the turbine should be simplified as much as possible installation and connection of the power cable are complex the need to protect the subsea cable for stability and to prevent damage should be assessed early on cable burying or protective shells may be considered details on the methodology used to design the windfloat e to predict its motion size and structure are discussed next the work that has been performed to date includes the following global sizing including rules check and hydrostatics stability hydrodynamics including model tests and hydroaerocoupling of the turbine and the hull structural design scantling strength fatigue of the trusses and the mast to assess the stability characteristics of the platform the restoring moment is computed in intact and damaged conditions at different wind headings the downflooding angle heeling angle for which the vents above the top of columns are underwater is also calculated and is shown in table vii the restoring moment curves obtained are compared to the curves of wind overturning moment to determine the heeling angle at equilibrium combined with factor of safety the comparison provides an estimation of the stability of the platform rough assessment of the wind overturning moment under steady wind was carried out in this analysis based on range of thrust coefficients for mw wind turbine worst case scenario failure mode is considered with combination of wind overturning moment and faulty active ballast system wind headings every are considered for this analysis damage cases are also taken into account by assuming that section of one column is flooded the damage remains limited due to compartmentation of the columns in all considered configurations the angle of static equilibrium is smaller than the downflooding angle with comfortable safety margin and the platform remains stable in damaged conditions the time domain software timefloat was developed by the authors for coupled analysis of floating structures it uses wamit as preprocessor to compute wave interaction effects and computes the time domain response of one or more floaters subjected to waves wind current and connected with moorings tendons hawsers fenders or any other mechanical connections it takes into account the viscous forces due to shedding around the hull and wave drift forces the solution is fully coupled as the influence of vessel motion on tether forces is taken into account at each time step and conversely the influence of tethers on vessel motion is also included at each time step summary of the algorithm is presented next in the frequency domain the equation of motion of floater is a b cx where and are frequency dependent added mass and radiation damping coefficients and is the sum of forces applied to the floater including the wave exciting force in the time domain one can show that the equation of motion has the following general form a t tk x cx f where is frequency independent and is the retardation function a sin k cos these integrals are calculated numerically timefloat uses an explicit scheme to solve up to degree of freedom dof equations of motion for two body system the windfloat is the only vessel considered in this analysis and the software only solves dof equations the general equation of motion is discretized in time and the following linear vectorial equation is solved at each time step a ak vk xk fmem fdiff fvisc fdrift fmoor fwind the left hand side of newton equation of motion contains terms proportional to the dof acceleration ak velocity vk and motion of the floater xk with the following notations is the mass matrix is the infinite frequency added mass matrix and is the matrix of retardation coefficients for which are integrals of the frequency dependent radiation damping coefficients due to outgoing waves generated by the moving floater the damping coefficients are computed by wamit and integrated at the beginning of the time domain simulation to generate the retardation function matrix is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix computed by wamit only the terms c c and are nonzero refer to wamit manual for details figure shows the hull geometry used in the wamit computations the right hand side includes the various external forces brief description of the terms in this equation is given below fmem represents the memory effect e the effects of wave components generated by past motion of the floater described by the convolution of the retardation function with body velocity as shown in eq above fdiff is the dof wave exciting force determined by fourier series using the wamit frequency dependent wave exciting force components and wave amplitude components representing the specified wave spectrum random phase and random frequency algorithms are used to generate irregular wave trains efficiently and accurately fvisc is the dof viscous force resulting from drag effects on the vessel columns and water entrapment plates these are computed using modified morison equation model based on the relative velocity of the wave current kinematics and of special line members results of multiple model test campaigns have been used to calibrate the empirical viscous force model the effect of ocean currents is captured with this viscous force model fdrift is the dof drift force on the vessel computed based on the wamit mean drift frequency dependent coefficients obtained with the pressure integration or momentum approach and the wave amplitude components newman approximation is used alternatively full second order diffraction model can be used if the wamit second order module is run previous work has shown that the second order potential solution was not required for the windfloat fmoor is the dof force on the vessel resulting from all mooring lines mooring lines are modeled either with cable elements or nonlinear springs for cable elements finite difference scheme is used to yield the dynamic mooring line configuration and mooring tensions at each time step the mooring dynamics and hydrodynamic loads are included using morison type formulation the nonlinear finite difference equations are solved using newton raphson algorithm as described by chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos fwind is the dof wind turbine force on the vessel superstructure the wind force model was modified to capture some of the aerodynamic coupling between the turbine and the windfloat platform it was assumed that the wind force applied on the rotor was proportional to the square of the relative velocity between the wind and the hub it was determined that an equivalent disk in the rotor plane with diameter would provide the maximum rated thrust of mw turbine assuming drag coefficient on the disk the wind force is perpendicular to the disk and its direction varies in time with the platform rotations the gyroscopic moment was estimated frommgyro p where is the moment of inertia of the spinning rotor is the rotational velocity vector of the rotor around its axis and is the rotational velocity vector of the platform around the pitch and yaw axes the gyroscopic moment mgyro is added to the moment contribution of fwind newton equation is applied in an inertial frame of reference which coincides with the vessel frame of reference at the origin of the vessel frame of reference is located at the mean water level directly under the center of gravity the axis points toward the bow e the column supporting the wind turbine tower the axis toward port side and the axis upward timefloat is written in fortran information is provided to the software through an input file in text format with all vessel mooring and numerical parameters additional input consist of the wamit files and the wind and current coefficients files after reading the input timefloat solves an initial static phase in which mean wind and current loads are applied as well as the mooring line pretension this phase serves to reduce the transient phases and quickly provides static information if needed then the solution is advanced in time using runge kutta algorithm for the dof rigid body motion and velocities at each of the four fractional steps used in this process external forces are updated wamit software was used to compute added mass and damping coefficients as well as wave exciting forces and mean drift coefficients only the underwater part of the hull is modeled the model includes the columns water entrapment plates and main tubulars connecting columns the bracings are only modeled as line members using the morison equation dipole elements are used to discretize the water entrapment plate since they are thin structural elements in the preliminary design phase selected number of design cases were defined based on combination of offshore mooring design codes and offshore wind turbine design codes e api rp sk ref and germanischer lloyd the design cases that were thought to be the most onerous for the platform motions were checked these included the extreme coherent gust ecg and the year storm hs shown in tables iv and in addition number of operating cases were run corresponding to the turbine maximum thrust wind speed s with associated waves hs and the maximum wind speed with turbine spinning s with associated waves hs for detail design and certification much larger number of design cases will have to be considered however the return period of the maximum events will likely be years in accordance with wind turbine design codes rather than the year return period selected for this preliminary study space does not allow for an extensive presentation of the hydrodynamic simulations however some results of numerical predictions are provided later and compared to model test results for key parameters model model test campaign was conducted at the uc berkeley ft long ship model testing facility to test the validity of the numerical analysis tools scale model of the platform was fabricated out of the acrylic lead weights were placed inside the columns and on the water entrapment plates to adjust the center of gravity to its target position item in fig the platform motion was measured using digital video camera tracking the motion of light emitting diodes placed on model the system provides dof measurements of the motion in the plane of the camera tower was made of thin not to scale in outside diameter acrylic pipe because the device used to model the wind turbine was relatively heavy and it was not possible to obtain the correct center of gravity with the lead weights if the tower was modeled with in diameter acrylic pipe as originally planned stays made of thin string were connected to the tower to increase its stiffness the turbine model device was connected to the top of the tower onto load cell which measured the axial force perpendicular to the tower large disk made of foam board was placed on the model to attract wind loads corresponding to the design wind force no attempts were made to match the atmospheric turbulence the wind maker naturally produces turbulence and the turbulent wind fluctuations are somewhat averaged by the large disk in the end the wind force was measured and the turbulence level will be compared to variations in the aerodynamic forces generated by prototype wind turbine the disk diameter is third of the total area covered by the rotor the drag coefficient on the disk is estimated to be an electrical motor was placed at the top of the tower to model the gyroscopic effect this well known mechanical force arises when rotor spinning around certain axis undergoes rotation around different axis for instance platform pitch and yaw would lead to gyroscopic forces applied on the tower these forces are significant design issue for the blades and the shaft bearings but they may also have contribution to the global response of the floater the motor was adjusted to spin at the froude scaled turbine speed of hz approximately rpm in prototype scale and the inertia of the blades was approximately modeled with two weights positioned on an aluminum rod the model was kept in position in the tank using four soft springs two of them connected to column which holds the turbine and one on each of the other columns the mooring lines were connected at the edges of ft square frame placed on the tank floor this provided top angle for the mooring lines of approximately this equivalent mooring model provided horizontal stiffness similar to that of the prototype six line catenary mooring system yielding s resonant period in surge however the prototype mooring design has not been finalized and the focus of these tests was placed on platform motion no attempts were made to measure mooring tension or validate mooring dynamics plunger type wave maker is located at one end of the tank and parabolic wave absorption beach at the other end set of five large wind fans was assembled to generate the required wind loading on the turbine model as shown in fig the effect of the active ballast system was modeled by shifting lead ballast on the model to compensate for the mean wind overturning moment h long realization of the year waves was generated the associated wind is s which is the maximum wind speed at which the wind turbine is allowed to rotate such wave events may occur at the site with wind speed under the cutoff speed due to swells most likely the rotor would be parked if such wave conditions arise however this conservative design case was generated to establish upper bounds of platform motion the year wave run was repeated without wind additionally regular waves were run with and without wind to determine response amplitude operators raos results of the year storm simulation are summarized in table viii time series of platform surge heave and pitch were processed to yield rms maximum and minimum values these show satisfactory agreement between the model test results and numerical simulations performed with timefloat the pitch rms is slightly underpredicted by the software versus measured and the minimum and maximum pitch angles are off by due to some differences in the predicted versus measured wind overturning moment the platform response is however deemed extremely well behaved with maximum pitch angle of in m hs sea state the maximum crest to trough pitch is with m maximum wave height crest to trough similar responses and trends were observed for all tested platform headings and and for runs with and without wind the maximum yaw angle measured in the runs was under raos were computed for wave periods between and figure shows the raos in surge heave and pitch for wave heading the presence of wind does not affect surge or sway significantly but its effects are slightly more pronounced on the pitch raos although wind speed is constant in all the regular wave runs it does impact the regular wave response because the wave induced motions generate sinusoidal variation in the relative speed between the wind and the disk which results in an additional periodic force component on the disk leading to corresponding periodic pitch moment regular wave tests were repeated with wave heading to investigate the platform yaw response e the model orientation was changed by rotating the anchoring frame to there is no wave induced yaw for heading since the platform is port starboard symmetric the yaw rao at is shown in fig additional tests were carried out by adding two large triangular vertical plates on each column named yaw plates with the bottom edge extending outward to the edge of the heave plate and the side extending from the heave plate to ft below the mean water level in prototype scale the effects of yaw plates in reducing first order yaw were minimal the irregular wave test showed that the second order yaw was also not significantly reduced overall the experiment did not point to serious limitations of the numerical modeling ability coupled aerohydrodynamic the forces generated by the wind turbine are reasonably well computed by the modified timefloat software and are correspondingly well modeled experimentally for steady wind speed however in reality the wind speed is constantly changing due to naturally occurring turbulence in the atmosphere large wind turbines are equipped with sophisticated control systems generally designed to keep the rotor speed constant at all times using variable torque generator and blade pitching mechanism changing the angle of attack of the blades by rotating them around their local axis this technique known as blade pitching can have significant effects on floating platforms as observed by nielsen et al and by jonkman the control system may induce negative damping which results in resonant oscillations of the platform at its pitch natural period in order to assess the effects of blade pitching on the floater as well as to provide accurate computation of all loads induced by the wind turbine on moving foundation software dedicated to wind turbine design fast was interfaced with timefloat to provide fully coupled aeroservoelastic hydrodynamic time domain numerical model of the windfloat platform with mw wind turbine fast which stands for fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence is an aeroservoelastic modal code for horizontal axis wind turbines developed by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel fast models the wind turbine as combination of rigid and flexible bodies the rigid bodies are the earth nacelle hub and optional tip brakes the flexible bodies include blades tower and drive shaft the model connects these bodies with several dofs including tower bending blade bending nacelle yaw rotor teeter rotor speed and drive shaft torsional flexibility fast uses kane method to set up equations of motion which are solved by numerical integration the aerodyn subroutine package developed by windward engineering is used to generate aerodynamic forces along the blades the fast and timefloat fortran source codes were modified to change timefloat into subroutine called by fast hydrodynamic forces including wave exciting forces viscous forces and mooring forces are computed by timefloat and passed to fast which solves the coupled turbine tower problem and passes platform motion back to timefloat the fast model of utility scale multimegawatt turbine known as the nrel offshore mw baseline wind turbine was developed by jonkman et al using publicly available information from turbine manufacturers this wind turbine is conventional three bladed upwind variable speed variable blade pitch to feather controlled turbine conventional control system was used with generator torque controller whose goal is to maximize power capture below the rated operation point and blade pitch controller designed to regulate rotor speed above the rated operation point the coupled fast timefloat model was run using the validated windfloat hydrodynamic model described in sec sample results are provided for m significant sea state with peak period and m steady wind waves and wind are at heading along the symmetry axis of the windfloat jonswap wave spectrum is assumed with peakness factor no atmospheric turbulence is assumed in this simulation figure shows sample time series of the platform roll pitch and yaw over min duration after the initial transients generated at the beginning of the numerical simulation have disappeared slight asymmetry is present due to the rotation of the rotor in one direction generating small mean roll and yaw component background platform pitch oscillation of approximately is caused by the blade pitch controller which excites the platform at its pitch resonant period around this was later tuned out by modifying the controller coefficients and adding an additional filter superposed to the resonant pitch cycles are wave induced pitch oscillations which result in slight changes between resonant cycles but are overall small contribution to the platform pitch in this sea state in fig time series of the base of the tower are shown wave induced surge is clearly visible in this irregular wave sea state mean surge is primarily driven by mean aerodynamic loads on the turbine the platform pitch oscillation results in vertical movement of the tower base at the same period as the pitch cycles figure presents the blade pitch angle time series at the bottom and power out take at the top the blade pitch controller locks into the platform pitch resonance with cycling of the blades drop in produced power occurs for approximately at each cycle when the relative speed between the nacelle and incoming wind drops below the threshold for maximum power output this does not have large impact on mean produced power which is mw on average but would require filtering further investigations of the control system have been performed following the recommendations of jonkman and nielsen to eliminate this resonant response in order to maximize power production and minimize fatigue loading of all components and systems results will be published shortly the windfloat is novel offshore structure which combines wind turbine and floater no formal design code has been developed yet for the design of structural reinforcement and scantling existing standards for offshore wind turbines were developed in the past decade from knowledge of onshore wind turbines and growing experience in near shore operations of wind energy devices however their scope remains limited to wind turbines in shallow waters with fixed foundations the windfloat is moored platform with complex dynamic behavior which cannot be overlooked in the structural design of critical elements such as the tower although offshore wind energy codes such as the germanischer lloyd guidelines for the certification of offshore wind turbines provide critical information about the extent of wind loading on the structure the design criteria may not be sufficiently conservative for floater to ensure high reliability of the design the structural analysis of the windfloat is largely based on standards from the oil and gas industry including the abs rules for mobile offshore drilling units and the api recommended practice for fixed offshore platforms the dnv recommended practice ref is used to assess shell buckling of the tower these design criteria need to be combined with realistic model of the wind loading effects and conservative estimation of environmental loadings on the hull the environmental loadings in both cases are obtained for sea states in the wave scatter diagram encountered at the intended location of the windfloat off the coast of northern california for each peak period tp in the wave scatter diagram the sea state with highest significant wave height hs is identified the resulting sea states with characteristics listed in table ix represent the steepest wave conditions for each peak period the strength analysis may be based on these sea states all peak periods are included in the strength analysis since wave loading depends on wavelength the largest wave height does not necessarily result in largest loading on the platform the fatigue analysis requires the generation of extensive numerical data the fatigue damage must be calculated for all sea states in the wave scatter diagram based on time series of nominal stress to avoid the production of large amounts of data and to save cpu time the stress range is computed only for those identified sea states for given peak period the level of stress is assumed to be linear with significant wave height thus the level of stress is scaled with significant wave height to complete the wave scatter diagram and determine the fatigue life of all structural elements for the truss and the tower of windfloat strength and fatigue analyses are carried out the computation of local forces and moments is achieved with finite element software sap by computer structures inc berkeley ca using beam theory the structural calculations are linear static analysis is sufficient on the truss since the natural period of its elements are too low to be excited by environmental loading however dynamic analysis is necessary to account for the excitation of the natural period of the tower the applied loads are obtained from timefloat time series for each sea state external forces and moments are applied at the extremities of the tubular elements in the finite element model or as distributed loads for the dynamic analysis of the tower the acceleration load calculated in timefloat is directly applied at the base of the tower the purpose of this study is to identify the weakest points on the elements and to run preliminary structural analysis to ensure the reliability of the elements for the strength analysis the most extreme stresses are used to compute recommended strength ratios when necessary the thickness of the tubular elements was adjusted to meet the appropriate safety factors in strength on tubular elements fatigue assessment is especially critical at the joints hot spot stress approach as recommended in api is used to estimate the fatigue at the joints between bracing elements this method entails the calculation of stress concentration factors scfs at the joints the fatigue life is computed based on the nominal stress as provided by beam column finite element model multiplied by the scf the damage and fatigue life are computed with formulation from dnv recommended practice rp for short term rayleigh distribution of stress levels the annual damage for all sea states and in three directions is combined with miner rule tda seastatespi m where is the range of the nominal stress pi the probability of occurrence of sea state in any given year and is the frequency of cycles which may be taken to the zero up crossing frequency recall that td is the design life and and are parameters of the api s curve the primary function of the truss is to provide the windfloat hull with sufficient global structural stiffness to withstand environmental loads three dimensional model of the windfloat is created fig the columns and bracing are modeled with tubular grade steel beam column elements main horizontal bracing members are ft long cylinders that support the horizontal loads between columns light bracing members provide reinforcement at of their length these bracing members are diagonal between the main bracings and columns for vertical stiffness and horizontal between main bracing elements to provide horizontal stiffness the joints between the column and the bracing are modeled with an element of stiffness ten times that of the bracing element and consistent with api recommendations the water entrapment plates are not included in this model but the applied forces on the plates are calculated externally and transferred to the base of the columns external and inertia forces applied to each structural member are computed using dedicated software based on the timefloat program which computes hydrodynamic loads by integration of the diffraction and radiation pressures on each part of the structure the software also matches the hydrodynamic panels with corresponding structural elements the time domain force components passed to the finite element model include weight of all elements radiation and diffraction pressures as well as mass inertia and hydrostatic stiffness effects wave exciting forces including froude krylov effects are passed via the diffraction pressure the viscous forces reflecting viscous loads on heave plates columns and truss members are applied to the corresponding parts of the structure the mooring forces are applied vertically to the chain stoppers at the top of column since they set the column in compression the horizontal component of the mooring is applied to the fairlead at the keel with top angle the wind induced forces thrust and torque are applied horizontally at the top of the tower drift forces are neglected since they are relatively small on individual elements it is verified that the sum of external forces and inertia forces on all parts of the structure is approximately null the truss consists of unstiffened tubular elements for the analysis of tubular members api rp wsd defines allowable axial bending shear and hoop stresses maximum predicted stresses on the elements in design environmental conditions are computed with finite element analysis the overall structural reliability of member is estimated by combination of the maximum to allowable stress ratios with appropriate safety factors all computed ratios must be less than to comply with api the stress on the truss is determined using static finite element algorithm on the model subject to all environmental loads including rigid body dynamics contributions to capture the highest stress level the forces are calculated for min snapshot of the most extreme wave of h simulation on all relevant sea states for three headings the maximum api stress ratios increase with larger sea states thus sea state with the largest significant wave height is associated with the maximum stress ratio at heading for most frame elements figure represents the maximum api ratios calculated in the worst case at heading for sea state plotted directly on the structure the shell thickness and diameter of the truss elements were adjusted to ensure compliance with api criteria it was determined through further analysis that the wind loads were driving the design of the truss in strength analysis figure illustrates the effect of wave and wind loading on the shape of the truss the main horizontal bracing elements undergo significant bending next the fatigue analysis is performed on the truss the target design life of the windfloat is years in this design cycle safety factor of is applied and calculated fatigue life of years is required this is very conservative and can be reduced as the engineering is refined the fatigue analysis is critical at the joints between bracing elements and the fatigue life of the connection is determined based on the stress ranges calculated by beam theory to apply the hot spot stress curve the scf needs to be determined for nominal stress away from the welding toe on beam model of the tubular element it is reasonable to expect the scf to be between four and six for well designed connection the von mises stress at the connection obtained from beam column finite element modeling is used as nominal stress in this case sensitivity analysis is carried out on the value of the scf the exact stress ratio between the maximum stress at the weld toe and von mises stress in beam theory will be determined precisely by finite element analysis with d model of the connection in follow on studies it should also be noted that weld profile control is assumed at the joints of truss elements so that the api curve may be used to define the relationship between hot spot stress range and number of cycles to failure the maximum levels of von mises stress in the truss are observed for peak periods between and depending on the heading this is consistent with wave loads on the columns when the wavelength is half the distance between columns the stress ranges are determined for all sea states in the scatter diagram and combined to obtain the fatigue life results are summarized in table assuming that the stress at the weld is accurately computed by the beam model and that no increase in wall thickness is implemented at the connection the minimum fatigue life of the nodes is years this optimistic assumption will be verified with detailed finite element of the connection it is likely that increase in wall thickness over short section near the node will be required to achieve fatigue life targets estimates of fatigue life based on can with wall thickness equal to twice the nominal wall thickness of the tubular members are provided in table xi the design of the tower must take into account wind and wave induced motions dynamic analysis of the tower is required since the first lateral mode of resonance is near at such periods some wave energy may be transmitted to the tower through the platform rigid body motions the tower is tapered unstiffened ft high tube with increasing wall thickness from top to bottom it supports ton nacelle and rotor at the top it is connected to the column at the bottom with bolted or welded flange joint the buckling strength of the tubular element is determined for extreme environmental conditions and the fatigue life of the joint at the base of the column is calculated the numerical model is composed of number of beam elements with decreasing diameter and thickness from bottom to top beam elements are sufficient for this study since there is no external pressure distribution on the tower convergence analysis is carried out to determine the minimum number of elements necessary to correctly represent the dynamic characteristics of the tower with eight elements the mass and stiffness of the structure have converged time series of accelerations at the base of the tower are generated for all twelve relevant sea states in the wave scatter diagram additionally the largest wind force the maximum of the thrust versus wind speed curve is applied horizontally at the top and the tower supports its own weight as well as the weight of the turbine the deflections of the tower are computed using linear beam theory with time domain finite element algorithm in fig the bending moment top and the sway motion at the base of the tower bottom are plotted during the largest wave event of the time series for sea state which corresponds to the year storm the maximum horizontal excursion at the base of the turbine tower is ft crest to trough during single wave cycle corresponding to ft wave crest to trough the bending moment time series clearly shows the dynamic response of the tower which includes oscillations with period below superimposed to the wave induced component with period around a ratio of critical damping is applied to the numerical model this is the level of damping expected on the tower when the turbine is parked in most scenarios when the turbine rotates the damping ratio increases on the tower due to aerodynamic drag sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the effect of damping on tower fatigue in fig the bending stress at the base of the tower is plotted for and critical damping ratios highlighting the variations in the dynamic response of the tower yet the energy at the natural period of the tower is small compared to wave induced variations in bending stress the structural damping does not affect the fatigue results significantly the rms of bending moment varies by only when damping is increased from to of critical damping in this high sea state the natural period of the tower is low enough to not interfere with wave induced motion of the platform the unsupported section of the windfloat tower is much shorter than onshore towers because the hub is slightly lower than onshore and the platform truss provides lateral stiffness to the tower up to ft elevation above the mean water line bending moment at the base of the tower is also plotted in fig for sea state tp the bottom of the figure shows time series of the sway motion which is combination of linear wave dynamics with period of and slow drift cycles with period of approximately only the energy from first order wave dynamics at low periods is transmitted to the tower excitation of the tower natural periods is not apparent due to the small magnitude of tower base motion for the strength analysis the design recommendations from dnv rp are used the shell buckling assessment is based on formulas for unstiffened tubular elements the column buckling does not need to be computed since kl e fy where kl is the effective length is the radius of gyration of the cross section is young modulus and fy is the yield strength of steel the largest events are identified over h time series the shell buckling ratio is calculated at the lower end of each of the eight elements using the local wall thickness and diameter for this element stress is largest at these lowest ends since the axial force and bending moment increase toward the base of the tower as illustrated in one time step in fig it may be noted that even for extreme events of the largest sea states wind force on the turbine contributes up to of the axial stress on the tower the wind force is critical to the design of the tower in strength shell buckling ratios are computed for these extreme events according to dnv recommendations at the base of the tower the largest design equivalent to the von mises stress to design shell buckling strength ratio is which is of the maximum allowed thus the tower will not be affected by buckling from dynamic wave loads and wind thrust the fatigue analysis is assessed at the joint between floater and turbine at the base of the tower the column and the tower meet in flange connection which is bolted or welded the standard deviation of the von mises stress is determined over h simulation of the structural response to the relevant sea states the bending moment is computed at point at the base of the tower for number of wave directions between and to account for the directionality of waves at the northern california location each heading is given identical probability of occurrence for this analysis the hot spot stress n curve with rayleigh approximation is used to determine the damage per year on the connection the scf should be computed from d finite element analysis of the connection however this work will be performed in later phase of the project once structural details of the connection are established in preliminary analysis sensitivity study is carried out on the scf at the base of the tower results are summarized in table xii the calculated fatigue life is years based on nominal wave induced stress damping level is conservatively assumed to be of critical for all sea states although it will likely be higher when the turbine is spinning the design of the connection between the tower base and top of column will have to be carefully designed to reduce scfs to acceptable levels based on fatigue life targets fatigue due to cycling of the wind loads and tower vibrations due to the spinning rotor have not been included in this model detailed aerodynamic calculations will be performed to account for these additional fatigue sources the work presented herein was aimed at providing sufficient technical information about the system to highlight challenging areas for any offshore floating wind turbine foundations the most prominent areas are as follows the turbines in their as is configurations may not be able to withstand some of the floater induced motions it is therefore critical to involve the turbine manufacturers to verify that the new motion envelopes are within their design criteria it is further important to minimize the floater motions most critically the pitch motion to eliminate any potential for the blade interference with the mast due to the gyroscopic force which maintains the blades in their turning plane fabrication and installation the foundation should be fabricated and integrated near the installation site however the infrastructure required for the construction of such large system may not exist near some of the potential wind farm areas and might have significant cost implication on the project steel cost has been rising significantly recently but so has the welding and fabrication costs optimizing the structure for steel weight may not yield the most inexpensive hull understanding the fabricator constraints during the design phase is very important to reduce fabrication complexities and associated cost run ups this paper also discusses the hydrodynamic analysis of the windfloat numerical analysis was first carried out with simplified models of the wind turbine forces this work was done with fully coupled time domain algorithm which accounts for diffraction radiation effects as well as viscous forces and the influence of the mooring model tests were performed to validate the predictive ability of the numerical hydrodynamic algorithm this experimental work consisted of generating wave loads in wave tank facility as well as wind loads using fans and drag disk placed on the model and rotor to model gyroscopic effects coupled aeroelastic hydrodynamic model was then implemented to provide better resolution of wind turbine loads and take into account the effects of the turbine control system for this work the validated hydrodynamic model discussed above was interfaced with fast software developed by nrel for design of wind turbines it was shown that interactions between the wind turbine control system and the platform generate small rotational oscillations with long periods which in some cases could result in slightly reduced power output further work will be carried out to improve the turbine control system and assess the effects of coupled aeroelastic hydrodynamic loads on the windfloat components lastly this paper discusses the preliminary structural assessment of the windfloat it focuses on the methodology designed to estimate the strength and fatigue of windfloat novel structural components it is assumed that structural loading on the underwater elements of the platform such as the columns and the water entrapment plates is mostly dependent on wave loading their preliminary design can be conservatively established using design guidelines developed for the offshore industry novel elements such as the truss or the interface between the wind turbine and the columns e the tower must be analyzed thoroughly due to the importance of aerodynamic loading on their design strength and fatigue analysis is performed using simplified beam model to assess the structural reliability of the structure under conservative environmental loading and identifies the areas that will require further detailed analysis the work presented herein was focused on providing sufficient technical information about the system to highlight follow on design challenges few critical topics have been identified on the truss and tower design the wind force is essential to the strength behavior of the windfloat since its contribution to the bending stress of the structural members is significant it is essential to include the effect of aerodynamics in the detailed structural analysis but in the preliminary analysis large factor of safety sufficed to conclude the global structural reliability of the windfloat detailed analysis of the truss node fatigue is required involving finite element models the analysis presented herein was sufficient to verify that the general arrangement and dimensions of the main structural components of the structure are compatible with expected environmental loading local reinforcement of the structure will be required but are not expected to significantly alter initial weight and cost estimates  a pressure transmitting medium named daphne which solidifies at ps gpa at room temperature is presented the value of ps increases almost linearly with temperature up to gpa at the high pressure realized by medium at the liquid state allows higher limit of pressurization which assures an ideal hydrostatic pressure we show volume change against pressure pressure reduction from room to liquid helium temperature in clamped piston cylinder cell pressure distribution and its standard deviation in diamond anvil cell and infrared properties which might be useful for experimental applications material properties under high pressures are nowadays fundamental information in solid state physics therefore high pressure studies are getting more and more common in recent years among those discoveries in the pressure range around gpa are remarkable very recently pressure of gpa gave rise to the superconducting tc of iron based lao xfxfeas from to organic conductors such as di dcnqi ag refs and and medh ttp asf showed interesting critical behaviors around gpa cenige shows generic phase diagram between magnetism and superconductivity and ceirsi shows high hc properties with relatively low pressure gpa many of those works require extremely high quality hydrostatic pressures for example effective masses and or single temperature in shubnikov de haas effect or de haas van alphen effect is falsified under low quality pressures an indispensable condition for generating high quality hydrostatic pressure is that the pressure medium should be in liquid state when the pressure around the sample is being changed usually increased when piston cylinder made of becu is used the maximum pressure without deformation inside is gpa below which the pressure cell can be used repeatedly where becu denotes heat treated copper alloy with small content of beryllium which is used for the construction of high pressure devices we have reported that daphne solidifies at gpa and flourinert solidifies at gpa therefore the combination of piston cylinder made of becu with the pressure medium of daphne always provides good quality of hydrostatic pressures but not with flourinert however recently developed pressure cells made of two layers of nicral inner layer becu outer layer ref or conventional maraging steel can generate pressure of gpa with these technical advances in the mechanical strength in the piston cylinder cell techniques and with fruitful physics subjects the requirement of new pressure medium with higher solidification pressure at room temperature comes up it is known that the methanol ethanol mixture remains liquid up to gpa but it seriously hampers studies that use conductive paste such as silver or gold or carbon paste therefore this mixture is not suitable for transport measurement furthermore this mixture is known to have large compressibility and is not favored even among those who are not dealing with transport study since large room for compression should be reserved when the pressure quality is poor it is sometimes difficult to distinguish real coexistence of two phases from simple mixture of two phases due to pressure distribution around the sample this difficulty is likely to occur when the pressure region under discussion is beyond the solidification of the pressure medium since daphne exhibits high solidification pressure this medium certainly extends the hydrostatic pressure region and thereby avoids such complexities the purpose of the present paper is to show new pressure medium that solidifies at gpa in addition to the solidification experiment we demonstrate pressure distribution and its quality in diamond cells compression data pressure reduction from room to low temperatures in clamped piston cylinder as well as infrared properties solidification pressure of pressure we adopted three methods for the examination of the solidification pressure one is to use cubic anvil cell the second one piston cylinder cell and the third one diamond anvil cell dac in the case of cubic anvil cell strain gauge kfrs kyowa electronic instruments co ltd tokyo japan is placed inside teflon cell filled with pressure transmitting oil whose solidification is being examined the inner dimension of the teflon cell is mm in diameter and mm in height and it is surrounded in pyrophyllite gasket as shown in fig the principle of the cubic anvil cell is as follows teflon cell of mm wall thickness filled with pressure transmitting oil is located at the center of the pyrophyllite cubic gasket this cubic gasket is compressed from six sides isotropically by six anvils and is crashed at pressure around gpa the crashed phyrophyllite works as an isotropic pressure transmitting powder to the teflon cell this process allows realization of hydrostatic pressure pressure as function of load force of the press is calibrated against the fixed points of bi transitions e and gpa in separate run figures c show the resistance of strain gauge kfrs kyowa electronic instruments co ltd tokyo japan immersed in daphne daphne and pes respectively as is seen in figs c the resistance shows clear kink at gpa for daphne gpa for daphne and gpa for pes respectively since the value of gpa for daphne agrees well with the previous result obtained with piston cylinder cell we realize that the kink in strain gauge resistance represents the solidification of the medium we speculate that the variation in the strain gauge resistance with pressure in the liquid reflects the shrinkage strain of the strain gauge itself by pressure while that in the solid medium reflects the shrinkage strain of the solidified pressure medium however it is noted that in the actual measurement such kink in resistance is not observed in real stuff in the cubic anvil experiments an example is shown in fig for the resistance of two dimensional organic conductor medh ttp asf we also examined the solidification pressure of daphne using piston cylinder cell made of heat treated maraging steel the method of examining the solidification pressure is the same as the previous one that is two strain gauges are located orienting in parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the piston cylinder as shown in fig when the pressure medium is in the liquid state the resistance of the two strain gauges varies in the same way with pressure while above the pressure of solidification of the medium the resistance of the two strain gauges behaves differently it is explained that before solidification strain gauge shrinks as pressure increases and after solidification it shrinks only along the cylinder axis but much less along the perpendicular direction in this experiment pressure is calibrated against the fixed points of nh i ii nh ii iii bi ii and bi ii iii transitions although gpa is an extrapolated value beyond the gpa of the bi ii iii transition it is very consistent with the value obtained in the cubic anvil experiment which is also calibrated at gpa of the bi iii iv transition by use of diamond anvil cell and the temperature dependence of the solidification we studied the solidification problem also by use of dac in paris this is the third method in this paper to deal with solidification and will be useful for those who are interested in experiment with dacs as shown in fig seven ruby spheres of diameter were placed in membrane driven dac using gasket hole of filled with daphne the position and width of the fluorescence line were measured for each individual ruby at increasing pressures solidification of the liquid is detected by the onset of deviations in the pressure indicated by the different ruby spheres as well as by the sudden increase in the width of the line similar to the technique described first by piermarini et al for this purpose we evaluated the standard deviation of the pressure values indicated by the seven ruby spheres which is seen to rise sharply at gpa this is the same pressure where also the widths tend to increase both the line positions and the width hence consistently indicate solidification at gpa note that the standard deviation at gpa is still only gpa e which is indeed small given the fact that these conditions are deep in the stability field of the solid daphne we extended our work to examine the solidification pressure psol as function of temperature in the same method we made two experiments at isotherms one at and one at the first one gave psol of gpa the latter gave gpa the quality of the data is the same as in fig within uncertainty psol of daphne increases linearly with temperature e at rate of gpa to reach gpa at pressure distribution in a precise pressure distribution in dac at room temperature is examined in kobe independently of the measurement in paris as shown for daphne and daphne using also ruby indicators as shown in fig the diameter of the sample space of the gasket is and the diameter of the culet of the dac is the length of the error bars is extremely narrow for gpa for daphne and increases above gpa which is almost consistent with the solidification these pressure dependences are consistent with the properties shown in fig however it is remarkable that even daphne has narrow error bars up to similar pressures in addition the transverse pressure distribution in the wide range of from the culet center is quite homogeneous even up to gpa for daphne physical properties material daphne is colorless and transparent and mainly consists of alkylsilane its specific weight is cm and its viscosity is extrapolated and mm at and respectively on the other hand pes is polyethylsiloxane daphne is mixture of olefin oligomer whose specific weight is cm and its viscosity is extrapolated and mm at and respectively comparing these two kinds of medium daphne is about times less viscous than daphne depending on temperature consequently sealing against mechanical leak should be performed more carefully with daphne than with daphne pressure with the interest in the compressibility of the pressure medium we examined the volume as function of pressure simply speaking the volume change is known by measuring the displacement of the piston of the piston cylinder however we have to take into account two factors one is the compression of the teflon the volume of which is non negligible compared to that of the medium and the other is the initial mechanical tightening of the system to correct the effect of teflon compression we measured the compression of the teflon rod which is shown in fig already in this experiment correction of the initial mechanical tightening effect is necessary we measured the displacement as function of pressure where the load of the ram is related to pressure which is calibrated against fixed points of nh and bi ii transitions in separate run for teflon measurement and in situ for the medium measurement after displacement mm is plotted against pressure gpa dp versus plot is performed this derivative plot shows distinct anomaly which is the border between mechanical tightening and the real compression of the medium and teflon after this anomalous point is detected it is natural to extrapolate the versus curve to naturally this determines the the initial volume at then the versus curve in full length is obtained once the compression property of teflon is obtained we can obtain the versus curve the contribution of teflon is treated assuming that the volume of teflon and the medium is aligned in series as shown in fig then using the compression data of fig and with the correction of the initial mechanical tightening we derived finally the versus curves of daphne daphne pes and water o all of which were obtained in our laboratory the purpose of showing the data for o is to demonstrate that our measurement and analysis are reasonably consistent with the old data of bridgman pressure we have many inquiries on using clamped cell for low temperature applications it will be useful to note the example of pressure relations between room and low temperatures of daphne and daphne the absolute pressure calibration at room temperature becomes much more accurate than the previous measurement because in the previous study we used becu cell which allows only gpa at maximum with which the bi calibration was not possible in this study we could interpolate the pressure of interest by using bi fixed point with the development of piston cylinder cell that achieves gpa low temperature pressure is calibrated against the superconducting tc of pb which is inductively detected then pressure relations between room and low temperatures are shown in fig it is seen that pressure reduction in daphne with this design is slightly larger compared to that in daphne but is relatively stable against the pressure at room temperature infrared infrared properties might be of interest for the readers the optical transmittance in the infrared region of cm ev is investigated for daphne and daphne in kobe both daphne and daphne show only simple absorption lines based on alkylsilane and hydrocarbon arrowed in fig such good transmittance features in the extreme wide range from cm far infrared to cm near infrared demonstrate that daphne and daphne are the most promising pressure mediums for infrared experiments although the fine structure is additionally observed around cm in the case of daphne the absorption is weak and the optical spectrum can be obtained through the pressure medium we presented new pressure transmitting medium named daphne an alkylsilane which solidifies at ps gpa at room temperature this value is much higher than the previously obtained values of gpa for daphne and gpa our measurement for pes the high pressure realized by medium at the liquid state allows higher limit of pressurization which assures an ideal hydrostatic pressure if one needs higher pressures with high quality hydrostaticity one can refer to our result that ps increases almost linearly with temperature up to gpa at for designing pressure devices we showed volume change against pressure for piston cylinder application an example of pressure reduction from room to liquid helium temperature in clamped piston cylinder cell is presented with dac pressure distribution and its standard deviation were shown which are also useful for other types of pressure devices for infrared optical study we examined the infrared transmittance  in this paper we present our vision of what kind of wearable devices and how they can be powered by the heat of human beings and by using ambient light the basic principles of designing body powered devices and ways of their hybridizing with photovoltaic cells are discussed the mechanisms of thermoregulation in humans and the laws of thermodynamics enable placing distinct boarder between realistic targets and the science fiction these allow prediction of application areas for wearable energy harvesters accounting for competitive batteries with long service life the existing family of body powered wearable devices and new technologies for thermopiles are discussed the theory and practice point at the necessity of using microelectronic and microelectromechanical system technologies for the target application area these technologies for thermopiles offer the possibility of reduced production cost therefore autonomous systems powered thermoelectrically could be successfully marketed the related aspects of design and fabrication are discussed what is an energy an energy harvester or an energy scavenger is small power generator that uses energy available in the ambient such as electromagnetic energy wind water flow or temperature gradient these sources are the same as those used in power plants or smaller power generators such as the ones for powering houses in remote locations light towers spacecrafts and on transport except those based on fossil fuels there are also microgenerators in the research stage which are to replace wiring and batteries in autonomous and stand alone devices or in devices that are difficult to access energy harvesters are being developed for the same purpose an energy harvester is typically from several to cm size power microplant which does not require fossil fuel but converts into electricity any primary energy that is available in the ambient for free the reason to call them harvesters is new application area they are used for powering small devices such as sensors or sensor nodes this way of powering them eliminates the need for cost ineffective work such as wiring or either recharging or replacing batteries despite the fact that plenty of microgenerators being developed worldwide are frequently called scavengers or harvesters not all of them are truly the ones probably miniature turbine in pipe cannot be called such as far as it introduces unwanted pressure drop therefore to compensate for this drop the pressure at the pump station must be proportionally increased thereby such turbine works actually as an ineffective converter of the energy spent by the pump station into energy produced by the turbine the same is referred to small dynamo or another converter of mechanical energy into electricity such generator requires additional power g cyclist spends more efforts if he she switches the bike dynamo on converting the temperature differences available in the ambient can be safely called energy harvesting unless it adversely affects humans themselves or the other objects built or used by mankind for example the outer and inner wall surfaces of buildings have temperature difference thermopile connected in between those two surfaces would generate energy however such thermopile would cause additional heat exchange between the two surfaces therefore this way of power generation would require increasing the heating cooling power of the home facilities by coefficient of more than the power gained due to physical interaction of microgenerator with ambient objects subjects it always affects them to some extent we arrive to the conclusion that true energy harvester is not only microgenerator that uses energy available in the ambient it also does not consume sensible amount of primary energy required in host neighbor object subject so there is no need to compensate for any adverse effect caused by the harvester the history of energy harvesting for powering it is matter of fact that energy harvesters as we call them nowadays have been used for centuries they appeared before the age of electricity therefore their output was purely mechanical we can mention the invention of self winding pocket watch by swiss horologist abraham louis perrelet before french revolution in about while not claiming that it was the first known example of energy harvester in the history the mainspring of this self winding watch was wound using the energy generated by the natural movements of the wearer another source of power was used in the clock atmos invented in by french engineer jean leon reutter the clock spring is wound using expansion or contraction of sealed gas filled capsule due to natural day night changes in ambient temperature and periodic variations in atmospheric pressure necessity of wireless remote control for television pushed american physicist robert adler born in austria to invent in device which was converting mechanical energy of pushing the button on remote control device into acoustic signals that controlled functions on the television set e it used the principle similar to that of tuning folks the device called zenith space command stayed in use for over decades as far as we nowadays push buttons on our battery powered remote controls there was no additional effort required from the user of ultrasonic remote control and it might be called energy harvester the age of electronics demands that the harvested energy must be converted into electricity therefore modern automatic watches generate electricity instead of winding the spring the photovoltaic pv cells are also used in low power handheld devices and watches the first watch powered by pv cells has been designed by american inventor roger riehl which has been marketed in under the brand name synchronar some other modern watches are also powered using pv cells hidden behind semitransparent dial the simplest pv powered calculators consume nowadays only few microwatts like watch therefore at daytime they do not use power from the backup primary battery thermoelectric converter of the human body heat into electricity was the latest in the market in the row of energy harvesters in handheld wearable devices the first device of this type again it was watch bulova thermatron has been marketed in however the market success to thermoelectrically powered watches came later in after perfecting the electronics of watches the modern self powered watches consume power in between several and a very low power however if we look back into the history we can find out that even the first self winding watches consumed extremely low power too indeed walking with such watch in the pocket for just few tens of minutes completely wound the mainspring the same is related to the atmos clock before getting an idea of making such self winding clock l reutter designed the so called day anniversary clock wherein the power consumption has been reduced to extremely low level it was so low that winding its spring once per days was enough for timekeeping only upon such dramatic reduction in power consumption it turned out possible for him to design energy harvesting atmos that consumes about on estimate e about four times less than the most economic modern electronic watches thus the history gives actually very fruitful idea that before designing the devices based on harvesting ambient energy the research must be performed on the energy available in the ambient for particular device and ii the power consumption of the device itself must be minimized theoretical bases of body powered human body constantly generates heat as useful side effect of metabolism however only part of this heat is dissipated into the ambient as heat flow and infrared radiation the rest of it is rejected in form of water vapor furthermore only small fraction of the heat flow can be used in wearer friendly and unobtrusive energy scavenger for example nobody would accept large device on his her face therefore the heat flow from it practically cannot be used at last due to the laws of thermodynamics the heat flow cannot be effectively converted it into electricity however human being generates more than of heat therefore quite useful electrical power still can be obtained using person as heat generator the tool for converting heat flow into electricity is thermoelectric generator teg the heart of which is thermopile typically only few watts of heat flow can be harvested unobtrusively on person and thermoelectrically converted into several milliwatts in form of electricity if we recall that watches consume times less it is fairly good power moreover pv cells of the same area typically generate much less power because not much light is available indoors where the authors and the reader of this paper are resting now the human body is not perfect heat generator as heat supply for wearable teg the body has high thermal resistance therefore the heat flow is quite limited this is explained by the fact that warm blooded animals have received in the process of evolution very effective thermal management this includes very high thermal resistance of the body at ambient temperatures below if the skin temperature decreases below thermal comfort as result not much heat is dissipated from the skin and only about mw cm is available indoors on average the measured performance characteristics of wearable tegs ref coincide with their theoretical analysis the practically confirmed conclusion is correctly designed unobtrusive teg in the right location on the human body can produce approximately cm of electrical power in moderate climate on average the produced power depends on the thickness of teg and its size the thicker the teg the better its power generation while the larger the teg the less power per unit area is produced at the system level short term or long term power reserve must be provided in the form of rechargeable battery or capacitor to avoid power shortages using such energy storage element the power gained by teg on occasional basis can be uniformly redistributed and consumed at near constant rate over long period of time there are specific requirements to both the thermopile and teg in energy scavengers including wearable devices first the thermal resistance of thermopile rtp for maximum power generation must be equal tortp rpprtegrpp rteg where rpp is the thermal resistance of air and holding elements interconnecting the cold and hot plates of teg e the elements connected thermally in parallel to the thermopile and rteg is the optimal thermal resistance of teg which maximizes power generation the optimal thermal resistance can be obtained from the equation of its thermal matching with the ambient rteg rbody rsi ret rbody rsi ret where rbody is the thermal resistance of human body in location of teg this is the thermal resistance between the body core and the chosen location on the skin rsi is the thermal resistance of heat sink e the thermal resistance due to convection and radiation on the outer side of teg and ret is the thermal resistance of teg which would occur if the teg becomes empty with no thermoelectric material in it equation is thermal equivalent of electrical matching of generator with its load the last requirement is that the ratio n ret rbody rsi must preferably be more than this ratio depends on the size and thickness of teg therefore the thinner teg the less power it regrettably produces equations call for semiempty teg where the thermopile occupies only small part of the device volume the rest must be occupied by air or material with thermal conductivity less than the thermal conductivity of air this is nice requirement because wearing something empty is more pleasant than wearing heavy batteries wearable devices as the first practical demonstration of body powered medical devices wireless pulse oximeter spo sensor has been designed fabricated and tested on people in fig the device noninvasively measures oxygen content in arterial blood watch size teg is used in this device as power supply with minimal power production of about at night and typical variations during the day within the range goldlike coating of the radiator provides nice appearance of the device the coating has high reflection coefficient in the visible region of the spectrum to minimize heating by sunlight and high emission coefficient in the long wave infrared region to enhance radiation losses from the teg typically battery powered pulse oximeters existing in the market have power consumption above mw therefore before making it powered from the human body power consumption of electronics has been reduced by factor of about in addition both low power radio used and applied duty cycling enabled maintaining the overall power consumption at record level of fig this battery free device has small supercapacitor mf as charge storage element for buffering the radio transmission bursts it is operational up to temperatures of at daytime and at duty cycle of at higher ambient temperatures the duty cycle must be reprogramed decreased otherwise the power generated could be less than the power consumed if this happens the device switches into sleeping regime for while during sleep its power consumption is extremely low and the device wakes up again upon collecting enough charge in the supercapacitor e when the voltage on it exceeds the disadvantage of energy storage in supercapacitor is that only about half of the energy produced over is used for the application when the storage supercapacitor is fully charged there is no power transfer into it from the teg unless the next measurement of the oxygen content in blood is performed the performance characteristics of the pulse oximeter are listed in table another example of battery free body powered devices is an electroencephalography eeg system fabricated in the main challenges in creation of such complex system powered by the wearer heat are lowering power consumption of biopotential readout while maintaining the signal quality and ii real time data transmission in the above example of pulse oximeter the signal processing is performed onboard so that power consumed by the transceiver is minimal fig in eeg on the contrary real time brain waves should be transmitted so the wireless link consumes large power following historical examples of successful energy harvesters this work has started with effective reduction in power consumption of the eeg application low power biopotential readout application specific integrated circuit asic has been designed first which provided excellent signal quality despite very low power consumption then the battery powered wireless eeg has been designed and its performance has been compared to the commercially available wired eeg system in hospital in application to polysomnography only after that the system has been turned into the self powered one the set of experiments has shown that the forehead is convenient location of teg on the head on one hand the latter provides high heat flow on large area on the other hand it is free from thermally isolating hair the power consumption of the eeg circuit see table ii required large sized teg e larger than cm to fit it to the patient head shape it is designed as sections with size of cm on stretchable headband fig the radiators on the outer side of thermopiles ensure effective heat dissipation into the ambient air and the thermal matching of teg with the environment the teg is designed for indoor use at typical ambient temperatures maintained in hospital wards at it produces about cm e close to the theoretical limit of power generation on people at this temperature in compact device there is however drawback of such high power generation at lower ambient temperatures the heat flow rapidly exceeds the sensation of discomfort and the device turns into uncomfortably cold object for example at the teg already produces mw but the sensation of cold becomes too annoying this problem is solved in exactly the same way as someone solves it on the body level in cold weather headgear should be worn on top of the system to limit the heat flow and make it comfortable to improve eeg system described above the teg has been hybridized with pv cells in indeed despite the fact that pv cells do not produce the same power as teg of the same area the outer surface of the latter is exposed to ambient light therefore if the pv cells cover the teg the joint power generation improves with no increase in the system weight and size in addition this improved version of the device has been relocated from the forehead to the temples for thermal shunting the hair its surface touching the skin has been provided with set of fins the fins comb the person hair while the device is being put on as result good thermal contact with the skin is provided and the power generation becomes not worse than on the forehead the pv cells provide additional power therefore the power generated by the teg can be proportionally decreased therefore smaller size of the teg is required or its thickness can be decreased the eeg system with such hybrid power supply in principle has to be supplied with rechargeable battery because power generated by pv cells is much more unstable than the one generated by the teg however in this demonstrator used in the office it was left with supercapacitor to show its self start from the body heat the headphonelike eeg diadem fig is more comfortable according to the user responses in particular at low ambient temperatures the pv cells used in this device have been fabricated on p type float zone si substrate in comparison to standard industrial process for monocrystalline pv cells their surface has been modified using random micropyramid formation together with the lithographically defined front side finger pattern an efficiency of has been obtained the pv cells are interconnected in the device in chessboard way in two parallel circuits this allowed obtaining an almost perfect dependence of power versus direction of light the power output varies only within while the wearer makes complete turn around him herself in direct sunlight the system has been tested at ambient temperatures down to however no discomfort has been mentioned by its wearers some features of this system are listed in table iii the power consumption of the eeg system is illustrated in fig about half of the power is consumed by the transceiver therefore more power efficient radio would allow either shrinking the generator size or powering more channels however the microcontroller and biopotential readout consume the other half of the power taking this into account the biopotential asic has been redesigned and its latest eight channel version consumes the same power as the two channel asic used in the battery free eeg systems discussed above the battery free systems discussed above have been designed to work at power consumption near the minimum of expected power generation to avoid power shortages indeed when comparing row the power consumption with row power generation capability in any table above the difference by coefficient of is always the case the excess energy which might be transferred into the charge storage supercapacitor most of the time was not actually transferred because the latter was already fully charged therefore at least of energy was wasted if however secondary battery is used as an energy storage element it can provide the required power for days or weeks even with no harvested energy therefore using battery enables operating the device at the power produced on average so that much less power is required from the teg on average as result the teg can be effectively miniaturized to be more comfortable for its user to make compact wearable self powered device the energy harvester is typically placed close to the location on the body wherein the body parameters are being measured therefore it seems logical that an electrocardiography ecg system should be preferably integrated somewhere on the chest that is why an ecg system described below is integrated into shirt the ecg system in shirt fig is powered by secondary battery the power consumption is mw and therefore if the system would have supercapacitor instead of battery power of about mw or much more would be required from the teg at this is to be sure that if the wearer puts business suit jacket on the system still works with the battery about mw from the teg is enough the battery is constantly recharged using the wearer body heat fourteen mm thin thermoelectric modules with size of cm have been integrated into the front side of the shirt it is less than of the shirt area the radiators of teg modules have been painted like chameleon into the shirt colors except one module that is to give impression about the module size this actually illustrates two basic ways of module integration one way is to make them invisible and the other way is to use radiators as decoration elements the second way is even more interesting for the market especially concerning the products for young generation the wiring and the other modules of ecg system are located on the inner side of the shirt pv cells are located on the shoulders to get maximum power both indoors and outdoors in the office the teg typically generates the power within the mw range at about on the matched load however if the wearer walks indoors the power production rapidly increases to mw because of high thermal resistance of teg modules they are never cold in this sense the modules function in the same way as textile in cold weather the other pieces of clothing are worn on top of the shirts however as measured at about outdoors while wearing thick jacket the power generation is by better than indoors the power management module contains fully integrated dc dc upconverter fabricated in m process it works with an open circuit input voltage of or higher from teg converts it up and charges small nimh battery the converter asic provides up to mw therefore three converters have been connected in parallel to enable input power up to mw to be efficiently transferred into the battery the converter contains charge pump with variable number of stages control algorithm can be used to vary the number of stages and switching rate and therefore to operate always with near maximum efficiency the net power conversion efficiency is at an open circuit teg voltage of it increases while the voltage decreases and exceeds at the voltage less than in parallel to the teg power conversion circuit there is secondary parallel circuit that allows charging the battery directly from pv cells two low cost amorphous silicon solar cells with size of cm each are integrated into the shirt on its shoulders fig pv cells are added to the system because if the shirt is not worn for months the battery can be discharged in such case it can be charged again by placing the shirt in direct sunlight for few days therefore when the shirt is taken off and not used for long time it must be stored in an environment where light is available periodically g in wardrobe with windows the small power provided by pv cells is sufficient to compensate for the self discharge of the battery that is by factor of about exceeds the standby power in this way even after months of nonuse the electronics is maintained in the ready to start state waiting for the moment the shirt is used again the open circuit output voltage of pv cells in the office is high enough therefore they are connected directly to the battery through simple rectifier circuit the use of pv cells has other advantages too first it provides some additional power g at least in the office and second in tropical countries pv cells compensate for lack of power generated by the teg the necessity of laundry demands reliable waterproof encapsulation of the system components teg pv cells and electronics the latter is integrated in two sided flex circuit and encapsulated using silicone molding fig smart power management is one of the key elements of self powered systems as discussed above the system uses two complementary power sources and its charge pump can track the optimal power conversion by changing the number of its stages and switching frequency depending on input power in addition the microcontroller keeps track of the input power from the teg and of the available energy stored in the battery if these drop below safe threshold the system performs an autocompensation by temporarily reducing the sampling rate and transmission duty cycle this allows nonstop wireless acquisition of an ecg signal on cost of its quality even under severe energy deficit where the full quality signal acquisition that requires mw cannot be provided if the voltage from teg drops to near zero which happens when the shirt is taken off the system switches into standby state with low power consumption table iv because of extreme fragility of thermopiles the shock protection components enforce thermoelectric modules as result its laundry with an acceleration of is allowed despite using noniron shirt for the ecg system its pressing can be performed safely because wiring sustains all possible regimes of pressing the flex with electronics is divided into quasirigid islands with dense components the islands are interconnected through highly flexible zones this gives limited amount of flexibility to the circuit and makes it compatible with both integration in clothes and laundry the production cost of tegs still exceeds the cost of the batteries this is because very small temperature drop can be obtained in wearable thermopiles e one to few as result large number of thermocouples few thousand are required thereby adversely affecting the system cost however microelectronic technologies may help alleviate this problem modern technologies it is quite interesting that the theory sec iii does not demand large size thermopiles for the maximum power generation in wearable teg the only requirement for thermopile is that it must have high thermal resistance per cm of the harvester on the skin if small size thermopile g micromachined one replaces in such teg g in watch size teg the thermopiles purchased in the market it can produce the same power this does not mean that any small size thermopile is good for the target application still both the electrical contact resistance and thermal conductance parallel to the thermopile in teg must be minimized because these are parasitic factors that adversely affect its performance characteristics in fact both factors can render the device worthless the modeling of micromachined thermopiles in wearable teg shows that due to scaling laws the smaller thermopile the lower aspect ratio is required fig an aspect ratio is the ratio of the height of thermocouple legs to their lateral dimension commercially available thermopiles require high aspect ratio of about therefore the only feasible solution is to make multistage thermopiles scaling the thermopile down results in proportional decrease in the aspect ratio that is required for getting the same thermal resistance as result at lateral dimensions below the optimal aspect ratio could be decreased to the values acceptable in microelectronics technologies at larger lateral dimensions e several tens of micrometers thick film and microelectromechanical system mems technologies could be used instead however the smaller thermopile the better is the chance of its market success as proof of the theoretical concept micromachined thermopile with tall poly sige thermocouples see fig has been fabricated on mm die based on the modeling results in such thermopile covered by heat sink die fig right the air between the dies thermally shunts the thermopile thereby decreasing the useful temperature drop on it to few tens of millikelvins therefore the thermopile figs and has been fabricated on top of m tall rim etched in silicon wafer fig this has been done for decoupling the thermocouple height and parasitic thermal conductance through the air inside the teg in the two versions of the thermopile either or thermocouples have been fabricated close to each other on top of the rim so that one thermocouple occupies an area of about after the ion etch of the substrate the mean distance between the thermopile die and bare silicon die attached to its top as heat sink die fig increases by factor of few hundred this allows reaching eq an additional decrease in the parasitic thermal conductance through the air between the hot plate and the radiator fig has been reached by increasing the distance between them and by using the thermally conducting aluminum spacer to interconnect the top die with the radiator as result despite the too low topography used in the device temperature drop of is obtained on the thermopile in wrist device figs and the temperature drop depends on the person activity and increases under the forced air convection e on walking person two versions of mems energy harvester have been fabricated in the first one fig the radiator is supported by thermally isolating pillars in the second one fig the thermal resistance of the ambient air is further decreased by using pin featured radiator an additional protection grid surrounds it and serves as touch protection as well as an outer shock protection two steps are still required to make such technology mature and competitive to batteries in wearable devices increase the aspect ratio and height of microthermocouples and ii develop thin film bite technology with better thermoelectric quality of the materials than can be reached with poly sige the required aspect ratio can be reached using projection lithography because critical dimension of is sufficient the minimum target within the required height of thermocouples has been already reached fig and the research is ongoing toward practical demonstration of poly sige thermopiles with high aspect ratio the second step e the film technology for bite materials is also in progress so that in the near future their thermoelectric properties are expected to approach those of bulk materials the production cost of micromachined thermopiles can be by factor of less than the cost of today thermopiles in the market because only mm of the wafer is required for devices such as those shown in fig therefore in mass production wearable thermopiles can be very competitive on cost with the batteries the other technologies such as thick film ones could also have market success if low cost process is developed the human body produces heat equivalent to the heat dissipated by few laptops several tens of watts out of the produced heat are dissipated as heat flows from the skin depending on ambient conditions the temperature humidity and wind due to laws of thermodynamics this heat cannot be effectively converted into electricity within the ambient temperature range the theoretical thermoelectric efficiency of converting human body heat into electricity varies from to on average in thin device e not thicker than watch the obtainable power varies within cm of the person skin respectively taking into account that only few percent of the body area unobtrusively can be covered by thermoelectric modules the only few milliwatts of electrical power can be obtained on person the extensively measured performance of wearable thermoelectric generators confirms the calculation result that in such applications they outperform solar cells on typical person therefore neither mobile phone or geographical positioning system device nor personal digital assistant can be self powered only several minutes per day can be provided which does not satisfy the market needs wearable sensors and medical devices including wireless ones rapidly evolve to very power efficient devices while maintaining high signal quality this enables powering them using body heat and ambient light the market success to such self powered systems can come only if the production cost of thermopiles is dramatically decreased several parallel developments of microelectronic and mems technologies for new film based generation of thermopiles is ongoing but still these are not mature some additional information for the reader is provided in power point presentation on wearable electronics self powered from the human body its present state and perspectives the power efficient self powered smart electronics in particular wearable electronics is knocking on the doors of the market however the battery in such devices cannot be simply replaced with an energy harvester it requires system redesign smart power management and frequently very low power radio in clothes the necessity of laundry and pressing gives good chance to self powered systems to compete successively with batteries environmental aspects are also in favor of energy harvesters that offer much greener garments for their postuse utilization  we perform first principles calculations of mechanical and electronic properties of silicene under strains the in plane stiffness of silicene is much smaller than that of graphene the yielding strain of silicene under uniform expansion in the ideal conditions is about the homogeneous strain can introduce semimetal metal transition the semimetal state of silicene in which the dirac cone locates at the fermi level can only persist up to tensile strain of with nearly invariant fermi velocity for larger strains silicene changes into conventional metal the work function is found to change significantly under biaxial strain our calculations show that strain tuning is important for applications of silicene in nanoelectronics graphene two dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms has attracted great attentions due to its exceptional mechanical and electronic properties and potential applications graphene is reported to be the strongest material ever to be measured and its charge carriers behave like massless dirac fermions around the fermi level ef and have high mobility as silicon being the element of iv family close to carbon the silicon analogue of graphene the so called silicene also initiates considerable scientific interest theoretical calculations have shown that silicene favors low buckled honeycomb structure the band structures of buckled structures of silicene have been investigated theoretically and found to exhibit linear dispersions crossing ef at the dirac points and of the hexagonal brillouin zone resembling that of graphene recently the silicene structures have been obtained by chemical exfoliation and possible growth of silicene on ag substrate has also been reported linear electronic dispersions of silicene nanoribbons and sheets are observed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy furthermore silicene has apparent additional advantage in integration into current si based electronics and thus has hopeful applications in nanoelectronics previous studies have shown that strain engineering can be an effective way of tuning the electronic properties of either bulk si or one dimensional si nanowires and is considered to be one of the most promising strategies for developing high performance sub nm silicon devices for example strain can enhance the electron mobility and reduce the effective mass of the carriers of bulk si and si nanowires it can also tune the band gap and change the nature of the band gap from indirect to direct in si nanowires as novel two dimensional form of si silicene shows encouraging advantages like the dirac fermion behavior over traditional bulk si and strain can be introduced by the substrate etc it is therefore important to study the strain tuning effect on silicene so far as we know although properties of one dimensional silicene nanoribbons have been studied theoretically in both elastic and plastic deformation region theoretical investigations of strain modulated properties of two dimensional silicene are mainly focused on the small strain range of elastic deformation however large strain may appear in practice and introduce novel modulations for silicene sheet thus systematic studies of mechanical and electronic properties of silicene sheet under large strain are necessary and timely for its applications in nanoelectronics in this paper we use the first principles approach to study the mechanical and electronic properties of low buckled two dimensional silicene under the elastic strain first the relevant elastic constants of silicene is investigated in the harmonic range of elastic deformation then uniform strain is applied on silicene the strain increases until silicene undergoes plastic deformation the response of the mechanical and electronic properties to the strain is systematically studied the low buckled configuration of silicene is studied by using periodical supercell model vacuum of at least is applied to eliminate the interactions between adjacent silicene sheets the first principles calculations are performed within density functional theory dft implemented in the dmol package the local density approximation lda is employed for the exchange correlation functional all electron treatment and triple numerical plus polarization basis sets are applied for silicon atoms monkhorst pack point mesh for the brillouin zone sampling is used for the hexagonal supercell which contains two silicon atoms and this sampling is scaled according to the size of the supercells in our calculations the structures are optimized until the maximum force allowed on each atom is less than ev we first optimize the geometric structure of the low buckled silicene without strain for the most energetically favored structure the lattice constant buckling distance and si si bond length figs and are and respectively which are in good agreement with previous calculations the strain is defined as a where is the lattice constant with strain the mechanical properties can be revealed from the strain energy es e namely the energy difference between systems under given strain and no strain since silicene is two dimensional material which has an ambiguous definition of thickness one can use the in plane stiffness instead of the young modulus to measure the strength a es where is the equilibrium area of the supercell as homogeneous and isotropic two dimensional material the elastic properties of silicene can be represented by the in plane stiffness and poisson ratio the poisson ratio can be straightforwardly defined as trans axial where trans and axial are the transverse and axial strain respectively rectangular supercell is constructed to calculate the elastic constants figure shows the supercell used for the calculations ax and ay are the lattice constants of the supercell in and directions respectively and varies with the strain values between to ensure they are in the harmonic region for each grid point ax ay the corresponding supercell is fully relaxed and its strain energy is calculated fig the strain energies for different grid points are then fitted to quadratic polynomial expressed by s varepsilon a varepsilon a varepsilon varepsilon es x y x where and are strains along the and directions respectively it is found that is almost equal to due to isotropy in the honeycomb symmetry the poisson ratio and in plane stiffness can then be obtained as a and a a c a a the calculated values of and of silicene are m and respectively which are in good accord with previous theoretical results and of graphene were calculated to be m and respectively it can be seen that the poisson ratio of silicene is about two times that of graphene and the in plane stiffness of silicene is of that of graphene because the position of si is below that of in the periodic table the si si bond is longer than the c bond in order to stabilize the honeycomb structure of si the structure puckers to form sp like orbitals and the bonding between adjacent sp like orbitals which are perpendicular to the silicene sheet is much weaker than the bond in graphene thus silicene is much less stiffer than graphene then large homogeneous strain ranging from to is applied to the system to investigate the response of mechanical and electronic properties the symmetric hexagonal lattice is chosen to provide brillouin zone with well defined high symmetry points and hexagonal supercell is used in the following calculations strain dependency of es and its derivative des is shown in figure when the strain is sufficiently small des increases linearly with respect to the strain which corresponds to the harmonic region the harmonic range of silicene shows asymmetry for tensile strain and compressive strain and can be taken between following the harmonic region the system goes into the anharmonic region in which the strain energy still increases with the increasing strain but des shows nonlinear behavior with respect to the strain at critical strain the strain energy has sharp decrease meanwhile the system changes to different structure from the hexagonal structure irreversibly and goes into the plastic region there are two critical points describing the instability of the structure fig one critical point is the strain at which des achieves its maximum value for silicene under uniform expansion is about and corresponding si si bond length is when des starts to decrease which means less tension is required to expand the structure imaginary phonon frequencies are expected to appear for specific wave vectors of acoustic wave for larger than which implies that the structure can be unstable under certain acoustic waves this phenomena is the so called phonon instability and has been found in graphene and graphane the other critical point is the yielding point in our calculations it is the strain at which the strain energy has the maximum value and then descents suddenly of silicene under uniform expansion is about and corresponding si si bond length is when the strain energy increases with the increasing strain and the structure maintains the hexagonal structure if the tension is released for the system may restore the configuration without strain it should be noted that our calculated value of corresponds to the system with perfect structure at zero temperature can be reduced by various factors such as appearance of defects and finite ambient temperature therefore when c the system is metastable and may experience plastic deformation due to specific wave perturbations defects and ambient temperature we further study the electronic structures of silicene under uniform expansion band structures of silicene under various strains are shown in figures c when no strain is applied the and bands cross at the and points at ef and show linear energy dispersion relation around the dirac points and which leads to vanishing density of states dos at ef fig this graphene like massless dirac fermion behavior of carriers of silicene agrees with earlier papers when the strain increases the energy level of the like orbital at the point shifts down towards the fermi level fig the dirac cone remains at the fermi level for strains less than about fig for strains larger than about goes below ef while the dirac cone shifts above ef which introduces finite value of dos at ef fig this semimetal metal transition behavior of silicene under uniform expansion differs remarkably from graphene whose dirac cone can keep at ef even at uniform strains up to it is expected that there will be significant changes in the resistance at low bias voltages along with this transition we also plot and the energy level of orbital at the point ek as functions of the strain to show the transition explicitly fig the orbital and the like antibonding orbital response quite differently to the strain ek changes very slightly when the strain increases while decreases rapidly with the increasing strain the semimetal metal transition occurs when ek since high fermi velocity is very important for high speed electronic devices we also investigate the fermi velocity vf of silicene in the semimetal state at various strains fig the fermi velocities can be obtained by fitting the and bands near the dirac point with the expression q vf where k for comparison we also calculate the fermi velocity of graphene without strain the fermi velocities of graphene and silicene without strain are and s respectively which indicates silicene can also be used in high speed devices like graphene the trend down the periodic table agrees with earlier calculations our calculated value of vf of silicene without strain is in good agreement with lew et al result and smaller than cahangirov et al result similar to graphene vf of silicene decreases slowly with the increasing strain when strain increases up to vf only decreases to of because the band lineup between silicene and other materials is important for its potential applications in nanoelectronics we also explore the work function of silicene under uniform strain work function of material is the minimum energy needed for an electron of the material to escape into the vacuum and can be defined as evac ef where evac is the potential energy at infinite distance away from the material in our calculations we average the electrostatic potential in the plane parallel to the silicene plane at different distances to the silicene plane and vacuum of is large enough for the average electrostatic potential to flatten to asymptotic value with the increasing distance to the silicene plane evac is determined as the asymptotic value of this average electrostatic potential energy and then work function can be obtained by using its definition the calculated work function of silicene without strain is about ev as shown in figure the work function increases monotonously by ev when the strain increases up to for larger strain the work function nearly remains ev and only decreases by mev when the strain increases from to thus strain engineering can be an effective way to control the band lineup in silicene related contacts in addition the strain tunable work function is also assumed to affect the charge transfer between gaseous molecules and silicene and hence strain modulation can be used in silicene based gas sensors in conclusion we calculate the elastic constants of silicene and find silicene is much less stiffer than graphene recently strain calculations for one dimensional armchair silicene nanoribbon which has dimer bonds across the ribbon asnr have been performed by topsakal et al it is found that two dimensional silicene sheet is more stiffer than asnr while yielding strain of silicene sheet is slightly smaller than that of asnr the theoretical values of in plane stiffness and yielding strain for asnr is m and respectively we also show that the semimetal nature of silicene can be destroyed by biaxial strain in the elastic range silicene undergoes the semimetal metal transition at the strain of and the fermi velocity changes very little before this critical strain thus only small strain could be applied on silicene if one wants to make use of the carriers of dirac fermion behavior the work function is found to first increase with the increasing strain and then nearly saturate the strain tunable work function also makes silicene more competitive in applications of nanoelectronics  this article explores the tuning of blue to pink colour generation from li ion co doped ypo eu nanoparticles prepared by polyol method at with ethylene glycol eg as capping agent interaction of eg molecules capped on the surface of the nanoparticles and or created oxygen vacancies induces formation of intermediate mid gap bands in the host structure which is supported by uv visible absorption data strong blue and pink colors can be observed in the cases of as prepared and annealed samples respectively co doping of li enhances the emission intensities of intermediate band as well as eu on annealing as prepared sample to the intermediate band emission intensity decreases whereas eu emission intensity increases suggesting increase of extent of energy transfer from the intermediate band to eu on annealing emission intensity ratio of electric to magnetic dipole transitions of eu can be varied by changing excitation wavelength the ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps study of as prepared samples confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies and eu but absence of eu dispersed particles in ethanol and polymer film show the strong blue color suggesting that these materials will be useful as probes in life science and also in light emitting device applications eu doped oxide vanadate molybdate tungstate and phosphate compounds are the excellent red emitting phosphors due to their thermal and chemical stability the great interest in doping of trivalent lanthanide ions in host arises from their unique intra configurational f transitions which occur as sharp and intense emission lines they are extensively used in plasma display panels pdps field emission displays feds cathode ray tubes crts fluorescent lamps and laser devices etc however the production of phosphor with uniform particle size distribution small particle size shape control and easy dispersion in polar solvents like ethanol methanol are challenging area moreover decrease in particle size results more surface dangling bonds which can absorb oh and co from the surrounding environment such as aqueous medium or atmosphere during wet chemical synthesis route such small particles can be dispersible in polar medium to some extent if capping agent is added to such particles the extent of dispersion in medium with long duration increases on other hand variation of luminescence intensity is also dependent on type of capping agents e capping agent with long chain hydrocarbon having functional group h cooh g ethylene di ammine tetra acetate edta citric acid can reduce luminescence intensity whereas capping agent with short chain hydrocarbon g ethylene glycol eg improves luminescence as compared to those prepared in water medium recently eu doped camoo gdpo and tb doped camoo are successively prepared by polyol method also some other methods such as hydrothermal and pechini methods are used for the preparation of laf and o nanoparticles among the oxide phosphors ypo has large indirect band gap ev high dielectric constant optically isotropic with refractive index high melting point and small phonon energy cm such small vibration energy is good choice of the host materials and will allow for effective radiative transitions between electronic energy levels of the rare earth ions in ypo host ypo has tetragonal structure with space group amd h h zircon type and the ion occupies d site symmetry the ion is coordinated to the oxygen atoms to form dodecahedron and the po tetrahedrons are isolated from each other in such manner yo po yo po yo group has two different types of o bonds whereas po group has one type of o bond the bond length of four o bonds is and remaining four bonds have it was reported that o bond length changes whereas o bond length almost remains the same on annealing ypo nanoparticles at higher temperatures in past few years ningthoujam and his co workers has examined the luminescence properties of ln ion doped ypo nanoparticles it was found that the presence of water molecules up to in ce co doped ypo eu was observed and thus the luminescence intensity was quenched significantly there are many research articles available to show the enhancement of luminescence in eu doped ypo nanophosphor by co doping li and bi appreciably in which the intensity of magnetic dipole transition is predominant over electric dipole transition but in some cases the intensity of electric dipole transition is predominant over magnetic dipole transition in eu doped la po ypo nh which is expected from the theoretical view on site symmetry of where eu ions occupy existence of intermediate bands observed in ypo system has not been discussed much in literature this understanding will be useful in transfer process from such intermediate bands to eu generation of light emitting diodes led in green and red regions has been reported however material with efficient blue emitter is challenging to led applications could the blue emitter be produced from ypo eu in this study we have prepared at eu doped ypo ypo eu and li co doped ypo eu at relatively low temperature of for using polyol route where eg molecules act as capping agent as well as reaction medium their detail crystal structure and luminescence are studied variation in luminescence intensities of magnetic and electric dipole transitions with different concentrations of li and heat treatment is observed interestingly intermediate bands between band gap of ypo are observed variation in color can be observed in this study by modification of surface and particle size annealing temperature the nanoparticles of at eu doped ypo ypo eu and li li and at co doped ypo eu are prepared at low temperature for in ethylene glycol eg the starting materials for po eu li are yttrium oxide o sigma aldrich ammonium dihydrogen phosphate nh po sigma aldrich europium oxide eu sigma aldrich and lithium hydroxide lioh sigma aldrich respectively in typical synthesis procedure of at li and at eu doped ypo nanoparticles of o of eu and of lioh were dissolved together in concentrated nitric acid hno in ml two necked round bottom flask and were heated at with addition of double distilled water at least five times in order to remove the excess acid to this of nh po dissolved in ml of double distilled water and ml of ethylene glycol eg were added the solution was stirred for and followed by sonication for uniform mixing the reaction mixture was heated at for under refluxing condition until the white precipitation is completed eg molecules act as solvent as well as capping agent during the reaction for ypo nanoparticles when the nucleation starts surrounding eg molecules cap smaller particles and thus particle growth is slow the agglomeration among the particles is hindered dielectric medium of reaction is also help in controlling particle size the precipitate so obtained was washed two times by centrifugation in ethanol to remove the excess of eg and then dried at room temperature for four days finally the as prepared sample is divided into two parts one part of the sample was annealed at in ambient atmosphere at the rate of min for during this organic capping agent eg is removed as co and o gaseous due to burning in addition only uncapped particles remain and growth of particles occurs the crystal structure of the material was identified by pw philips powder ray diffractometer xrd with ni filtered cu radiation at kv and ma all patterns were recorded over the angular range deg with step size of the scherrer relation was used to calculate the average crystallite size from xrd spectrum the relation is expressed as follows documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation frac

mixed together with eg and dispersed particles could be achieved under ultrasonic vibration for a drop of the dispersed particles was put over the carbon coated copper grid and evaporated to dryness in the ambient atmosphere the high resolution tem hrtem images were recorded at kev using fei titan microscopy infrared ir spectrum was measured with ftir spectrometer bomem mb with resolution of cm the sample was mixed with kbr sigma aldrich in ratio and pellet was prepared such pellet was used to record the spectra the photoluminescence pl spectra of these powder phosphors were recorded using hitachi spectrometer with w xe lamp as source at the spectral resolution of nm all the measurements were carried out at room temperature pl decay was recorded with edinburgh instrument equipped with nd yag laser pumped optical parameters oscillator opo having pulse width of ns and repetition frequency of hz as the excitation source chemical bonding energies of ions in sample were measured using ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps specs germany mg x ray source hv ev uv visible absorption spectra were recorded using simadzu uv pc spectrophotometer the xrd patterns of as prepared and annealed at li co doped ypo eu samples are matched with jcpds card no the patterns show that samples have single phase and exhibit tetragonal structure of ypo having space group amd figure shows the typical xrd pattern of at li co doped ypo eu annealed at the average crystallite sizes of at li co doped ypo eu as prepared and annealed samples are found to be and nm respectively the samples show high crystalline nature and intensity increases with li ion concentration also annealing at confirms the increase in crystalline nature figure shows the ftir spectra of at li co doped ypo eu nanoparticles of as prepared and annealed samples both show similar pattern in peaks except at and cm in the case of as prepared sample the peaks at and cm correspond to the bending vibrations of po termed as region the strong bands centered at and cm correspond to stretching vibrations of po termed as region the vibration intensity of region is found to be stronger than that of region the integrated intensities of both and are found to increase with annealing temperature we do not find any extra phosphorus containing groups such as o which is generally observed at cm the intensities of peaks corresponding to bending and stretching vibrations of h o centered at and cm decrease with annealing temperature in the case of as prepared sample the weak peaks due to stretching vibrations of c group of eg are found at and cm and the peaks centered at and cm correspond to no group which may be originated from the presence of hno which is added in reaction the oh ions on the surface of particle act as source of quencher to luminescence intensity and the luminescence intensity can be significantly enhanced after removing oh ions by heat treatment discussed later the peak at cm corresponds to asymmetric stretching vibration of co which arises from absorption over particle or ir lamp passing through air medium tem transmission electron microscope tem and high resolution tem hrtem are used to characterize the morphology and structure of as prepared and annealed at li co doped ypo eu samples figures and show tem and hrtem images of as prepared sample the well resolved lattice fringes of as prepared sample having inter planar distance are observed and are assigned to plane of tetragonal system after fast fourier transform fft figure shows lattice fringes of its annealed sample two types of lattice fringes having inter planar spacing of and corresponding to the and planes of tetragonal phase of ypo are found the selected area electron diffraction pattern of as prepared sample is shown in figure the high crystallinity is confirmed by the rings as shown in figure the assignment of the rings is shown in figure itself spherical particle sizes of and nm are observed from as prepared and annealed samples respectively xps to study the li ion effect on chemical binding energies of ions in ypo eu compound xps measurements of as prepared and at li co doped ypo eu samples are studied fig the xps spectrum in fig shows the peak corresponding to li having core binding energy be ev for at li co doped ypo eu sample figure shows the peaks at and ev corresponding to d and and ev corresponding to eu for and at li co doped ypo eu samples respectively notably the peak for p falls on ev it is difficult to distinguish eu and p when the spectra in range of ev is expanded fig we observe small peak at ev which corresponds to eu and no peak corresponding to eu is observed at ev this confirms the high probability of eu present in samples figure shows the xps spectra of p and its corresponding peaks at ev for and at li ypo eu samples are observed the s peaks for and at li ypo eu samples are found to be at and ev are observed fig from this study be of individual ions increases on li co doping this suggests the improvement of crystallinity on li co doping e defect decreases shifting of be signifies that possibility of change in positive charge and or chemical environment around eu xps study confirms that the li co doping changes the chemical environment around eu it is to be noted that there is asymmetric nature of s peak at the higher energy site e hump at ev which is signature of oxygen vacancy in lattice deconvolution of peak s of as prepared and at li co doped ypo eu samples using lorentzian distribution function is shown in figs a and b here symbol refers to supplemental material two peaks and ev could be fitted well luminescence figure shows excitation spectra of as prepared samples of li and at co doped ypo eu by monitoring the emission wavelength at nm the excitation spectrum consists of strong absorption band between nm with center at nm and full width at half maxima fwhm nm which can be assigned to the charge transfer from to eu eu ct there are sharp absorption peaks at and nm which correspond to d g and l of eu respectively the absorption intensity of l transition of eu ion at nm fwhm nm is times stronger than eu ct absorption indicating weak energy transfer from eu ct band to eu figure shows the excitation spectra of annealed samples by monitoring the emission wavelength at nm peaks are similar to as prepared samples however eu ct band is found at nm and its intensity is less than that of as prepared sample the blue shift of eu ct band with respect to as prepared sample indicates increase of ionicity with annealing in pure eu there is no absorption peak at nm and also intensity of eu ct band is more than that of eu nm in this study absorption intensity in nm is very high and also intensity of eu ct band is much less than that of eu nm it means that there is host intermediate band absorption however pure ypo has band gap of ev nm which is more than the energy of eu ct band large absorption band in nm in excitation spectra fig indicates that there are intermediate bands localized levels between the band gap of ypo similar observations were reported in eu li co doped lapo and zno in overall li doping improves absorption intensity we have recorded the emission spectra of li and at co doped ypo eu at different excitation wavelengths nm and nm samples with li and at are shown in figs and remaining samples are shown in figures and we have used nm filter for recording emission spectra in all excitations except nm no filter is used in the emission spectra of ypo eu fig the broad emission intensity in nm with maximum at nm in case of as prepared sample and at nm in case of annealed sample when excited at nm are observed this broad peak emission is related to host or intermediate bands the red shift in emission peak is related to increase of crystallite size on annealing the intensity of broad emission increases with increasing excitation wavelength from to nm and even is much more than that of eu emission at and nm magnetic f and electric f dipole transitions respectively it is expected that luminescence intensity of eu should be more on excitation at nm eu ct band as compared to that at nm because of energy transfer from eu ct band to eu but this is opposite to this observation it means that there are intermediate absorption bands between band gap of ypo this may be related to interaction with absorbed gases co o or capping agent eg in case of as prepared sample or carbon remained in case of annealed sample or defects present in lattice the emission intensities after excitation at and nm in case of as prepared sample are very high and found to saturate whereas annealed sample shows the saturation at nm excitation in the case of annealed sample the host intermediate bands emission intensity decreases and the broadening of emission peak in nm occurs as compared to as prepared sample this may be related to the extent of decrease of defect or absorbed gases or capping agent eg on annealing and thus it enhances energy transfer rate from host intermediate band to eu when li is co doped in to ypo eu the intensity related to host intermediate bands increases up to li at and then decreases with further increase of li in case of as prepared samples figs and and figs and in case of this intensity remains almost unchanged except at of li where intensity is found to be high in all li co doping systems the annealed samples show lower luminescence intensity related to host intermediate as compared to as prepared sample this trend is similar to that without li co doping overall the peak maximum corresponding to the host intermediate shifts to the higher wavelength by nm with li co doping up to at this may be related to the increase in crystallite particle size on annealing in addition to strong host intermediate band emission the electric and magnetic dipole transitions of eu at and nm are observed their intensity variations with excitation wavelengths as well as li concentrations are found these are clearly shown in figs s emission intensities at different excitation wavelengths are compared by fitting the area under electric

electrical dipole transition its fwhm and asymmetric ratio with li at nm excitation increases with li up to at and decreases with further increase of li its fwhm decreases from to nm as li concentration increases up to at value is found to be less than indicating higher intensity for magnetic dipole transition over that for electric dipole transition it is to be noted that is found to be at and nm excitations table when we see site symmetry of eu in ypo it should be d which has asymmetric environment with two different eu bond lengths in such view the electric dipole transition should be more than the magnetic dipole transition e variation in intensities of these two dipole transitions at different excitation wavelengths was not discussed in the previous studies to the best of authors knowledge this may be related to the interaction of incoming excitation light with eu environment nearest environment and second nearest environment po the interaction parameter will depend on incoming wavelength and intensity this revelation after analysis is one of present findings in case of annealed samples variation of luminescence intensity with li is similar to as prepared samples but their luminescence intensity and fwhm are higher than as prepared samples for nm excitation figs and increase in luminescence intensity is related to decrease of non radiative rate from surface dangling bonds and capping ligand eg on annealing is found to close to at all excitation wavelengths and such behavior is different from as prepared samples highest is found to be for at li co doped ypo eu under and nm for annealed sample its value varies between in some glass systems and in camoo hosts sohn et al reported the effect of excitation wavelengths at nm host excitation and nm eu ct excitation on emission intensity and of eu doped ypo at nm excitation is whereas this becomes at nm excitation ningthoujam and his co workers have examined the luminescence properties of eu ion doped ypo nanoparticles capped by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta it is found that the excitation wavelength significantly influences the emission intensity and due to the presence of capped layer on the surface of nanoparticles recently li and his coworkers studied white light emission from oleic acid capped lapo eu nanorods due to the formation of intermediate state mid gap states as consequence of the interaction of chemical bonding of oleic acid to lapo eu the color coordinates from red to white under different excitation wavelengths nm were obtained guo and his coworkers found the higher luminescence intensity at electric dipole transition than that at magnetic dipole transition in glass ceramic having eu doped ypo nano crystals in addition to eu they found the presence of eu in glass matrix which results broad emission peak centered at nm due to the f transition of eu conversion from eu to eu is related to the reduction process occurred from fluoride used in the preparation of glass ceramic ray and his coworkers prepared ypo eu nanorods and nanoparticles which have dominant in electric dipole transition than magnetic dipole transition from above literatures variation of luminescence intensities of electric and magnetic dipole transitions depends on sample characteristics now we have question for origin of broad luminescence observed in nm whether it is from the host or due to eu present in the sample in our study the probability of reduction of eu to eu is very low since there is no fluoride precursor during preparation also our xps study fig confirms the no peak corresponding to eu in the sample spectrum this suggests that the observed luminescence in nm is related to the presence of intermediate bands within host which arises from oxygen defect in lattice from xps study or capping ligand interaction with surface of particles or adsorbed gases over surface of particles from ir study figures and show the photographs of at li co doped ypo eu as prepared and annealed nanoparticles under the nd yag laser excitation at nm power at focusing spot as prepared sample shows strong blue color whereas annealed sample shows pink colour when we see emission spectrum for nm excitation fig in which power is used it is expected that blue green colour should be instead of pink colour in our opinion the high power of laser makes electric and magnetic dipole transition intensities more prominent over host emission for sample pink colour the presence of eg molecules capped on surface of as prepared li co doped ypo eu particles are useful to easy dispersion of nanoparticles in polar solvents like ethanol and polyvinyl alcohol pva for typical dispersion mg of as prepared at li co doped ypo eu is dispersed in ml of ethanol followed by ultrasonication

kept for days at room temperature for drying in this way polymer films of at li co doped ypo eu having thickness mm and cm diameter are prepared the film shows very bright blue under nm laser excitation fig both dispersed particles in the ethanol and the film show blue colour with the cie commission internationale de eclairage chromaticity co ordinates li et al reported strong blue emission of oleic acid capped eu doped lapo having cie values around under nm excitation uniform brightness of the thin film confirms the homogeneous distribution of particles in pva matrix it is found that peak positions of electric and magnetic dipole transitions are unaffected after dispersion of nanoparticles in pva polymer matrix which is not shown here the emission intensity of as prepared nanoparticles re dispersed in ethanol and pva matrix is slightly less than the powder sample this is due to the presence of less no of eu ions per unit volume of dispersion this film will be useful in the development of optoelectronic devises figure shows the schematic diagram of energy levels in li co doped ypo eu band gap of ypo ev nm is more than eu charge transfer band ev nm and their band edges are crossing each other because of defect on surface or capping ligands on particles there is possibility to have intermediate bands which is also supported by uv visible absorption measurement fig absorption band extends up to nm such intermediate band absorption helps in enhancement of luminescence intensity by energy transfer et to eu similar type of results are shown in case of lapo nanoparticles after excitation at nm the electrons from the valence band go to excited state which falls on intermediate bands mid gap states and holes are created at the valence band after the removing the excitation source the electrons comes to the valence band ground state during this the electron hole recombination takes place resulting to emission at blue to pink colour regions in addition emission due to eu f and f could be observed due to energy transfer from intermediate bands or eu ct band to the excited state of eu luminescence the luminescence decay curves of the level nm of eu for as prepared and annealed samples of li and at co doped ypo eu have been shown in figs c excitation wavelength is fixed at nm from nd yag laser the decay curves are not well fitted by mono exponential equation i exp the typical mono exponential curve fitting to data of at li doped ypo eu annealed at with is shown in figure and parameters obtained after fitting is given in table the fitting behavior can be clearly understood by plotting ln vs which is shown in fig inset the fitted straight line does not match with decay data points this suggests that environment of eu ions in lattice are not same in different positions all decay data are fitted by using bi exponential decay equation which is expressed as documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation i t tau e tau end equation end document i t e where and are the intensities at different time intervals and and their corresponding lifetimes the bi exponential fitting to luminescence decay data of annealed at li

lifetime of eu increases from to ms with increasing li concentration from to at and decreases with further increase of li e at li where lifetime is ms this behavior is similar to variation in luminescence intensity with li fig in case of annealed samples lifetime value of ms is observed for li and at and ms for li at the lifetime value increases on annealing the bi exponential decay suggests the availability of eu ions on surface and core of particles on annealing the percentage of decreases and that of increases this indicates decrease of non radiative rate from surface of particles on annealing li li and at co doped ypo eu nanoparticles are prepared using polyol method at reaction temperature as prepared samples are annealed to to remove the presence of dangling bonds on the surface of nanoparticles in the case of as prepared samples the formation of intermediate bands mid gap states is found the intensities of both the intermediate bands nm and eu nm emission of the samples increase with li up to at and then decrease with increasing li in the case of as prepared samples however significant change has not been observed in intermediate band emission intensities for annealed samples with without co doping of li and its emission intensity is slightly less than as prepared sample except at li co doping however the intensity of eu emission is significantly enhanced on annealing at the intensities of intermediate band and eu emission are significantly influenced by the excitation wavelengths nm blue emission is not due to the eu confirmed by xps study and this is assigned to intermediate bands within host band gap where electron hole recombination takes place after excitation we observe core binding energy with small peak at ev in xps spectra which corresponds to eu and no peak corresponding to eu is observed at ev this confirms the high probability of eu present in samples the as prepared nanoparticles are re dispersed in ethanol and pva thin film is prepared form the re dispersed particles the film shows uniform bright blue the cie chromaticity coordinates of as prepared samples are close to they can be potential candidate for life science activity and leds applications the emission intensity ratio of electric to magnetic dipole transitions varies with the excitation wavelength in case of as prepared samples the lifetime of eu increases from to ms with increasing li concentration up to at and decreases with li e at li where lifetime is ms and such behavior is similar to variation in luminescence intensity in case of annealed samples lifetime values are found to be and ms for and at li co doping respectively this work demonstrates the preparation of high quality luminescence material by introducing li ion which helps in enhancement of luminescence intensity of eu  in this study we measured the cell temperature and methanol concentration dependences of direct methanol fuel cell dmfc performances and its polarization characteristics using single cell with ag ag so reference electrode which has been developed for the dmfc research in our laboratory the membrane electrode assembly composed of carbon supported pt ru and pt catalysts and the nafion membrane was used for the measurements as result the power densities obtained while feeding and mol dm methanol solutions increase in the order of and for the mol dm methanol the power density at is lower than those at and in these cases the polarization curves to investigate the details of the relationship between the dmfc performance and temperature indicate that for the and mol dm methanol the current densities measured at the same anode and cathode potentials are enhanced with the increasing temperature as for the mol dm methanol the current densities at the anode and cathode decrease at to clarify reason for the particular results of the mol dm methanol the dmfc performances and the polarization curves at and were compared as function of the methanol concentration these results demonstrate that the decrease in the dmfc performance at by feeding mol dm methanol is attributed to the simultaneous appearance of the crossleak and methanol crossover causing the decline in the methanol oxidation performance at the anode and reduction performance at the cathode direct methanol fuel cells dmfcs are clean and efficient energy converter operating at low temperature such as around room temperature in this system methanol supplied to the anode is directly oxidized therefore no reforming equipment is required which leads to the realization of small and compact dmfc system based on this feature the dmfcs are expected to be used as power sources for portable electronic devices however the dmfcs still have not been widely used because of their low power density with regard to the reasons behind the low power density of the dmfcs low methanol oxidation activity of the anode catalyst and decline in the reduction performance due to methanol crossover have been stated for obtaining high power density during the dmfc power generation the cell temperature and methanol concentration are the important factors thus in order to produce dmfcs with high power density it is important to assess the effects of these factors on the anode and cathode characteristics the methanol oxidation performance at the anode and the reduction performance at the cathode are predicted to change during the power generation due to co poisoning and the methanol crossover consequently the polarization characteristics at the anode and cathode should be simultaneously measured during the power generation for these measurements dmfc single cell having dynamic hydrogen electrode dhe used as the reference electrode is applied to simultaneously measure the cell voltages and the potential differences of the anode reference and cathode reference the electrode potential of the dhe reflects the oxidation evolution reactions at the pt when high concentration of methanol is fed to the anode of the single cell for long time some of the methanol reaches the pt of the dhe the methanol will be oxidized at the pt which influences the oxidation evolution reactions that determines the hydrogen electrode potential consequently in order to correctly evaluate the anode and cathode characteristics another reference electrode which is not influenced by methanol is required based on this information we have previously developed new dmfc single cell having ag ag so as the reference electrode which is not influenced by methanol as result the anode and cathode characteristics can be correctly measured during the dmfc power generation by using this single cell in this study we first measured the cell temperature dependence of the dmfc performance while feeding and mol dm methanol solutions to the anode and humidified gas to the cathode next the details of the relationship between the cell temperature and the dmfc performance were investigated from the polarization curves at the anode and cathode measured during the power generation furthermore the changes in the dmfc performances and its polarization characteristics were evaluated at and as function of the methanol concentration based on these results we assessed the cell temperature and methanol concentration dependences of the dmfc performance preparation of membrane electrode the mea geometric electrode area cm used in this study was prepared as follows nafion dupont was used as the polymer electrolyte membrane the membrane cm cm was boiled in mol dm so for and then washed twice by boiling in pure water for commercially available pt amount of deposited pt wt tanaka kikinzoku kogyo and pt ru amount of deposited pt ru wt pt ru atomic ratio tanaka kikinzoku kogyo catalysts were used in the cathode and anode respectively the catalyst was dispersed using ball mill in wt nafion solution wako pure chemical industries diluted by mixed solvent of methanol propanol and millipore water weight ratio the dispersed solution was spread on carbon paper tgp h toray over cm area the amount of the spread pt or pt ru was adjusted to mg cm subsequently the pretreated nafion membrane was sandwiched between the two catalyst coated carbon papers and then hot pressed at kn and for min preparation of ag ag so reference schematic illustration of ag ag so reference electrode to measure the anode and cathode characteristics during the dmfc operation is shown in the upper panel of fig this reference electrode was prepared as follows the surface of ag wire mm was covered with ag so by anodic polarization in mol dm so pt wire of mm diameter and cm length was inserted inside the tip of the pyrex glass tube for liquid junction to the reference electrode the tip of the glass tube was then heat sealed finally the glass tube for the reference electrode including the ag wire of which the surface was covered with ag so was filled with saturated so aqueous solution measurements of dmfc single cell performance and anode and cathode polarization the prepared mea was installed in single cell having ag ag so reference electrode for the measurements as shown in the upper part of fig the ag ag so electrode was installed from the cathode side and placed in direct contact with the nafion membrane to measure the dmfc performances and the polarization curves the single cell was connected to two electrometers he hokuto denko and an electrochemical instrument electronic load plz wa kikusui and the data were collected using data logger gl graphtec see the lower panel of fig prior to the measurements the pre operation for conditioning the mea was carried out by feeding mol dm methanol solution to the anode at ml min and fully humidified gas to the cathode at ml min the cell temperature and the temperatures of the supplied methanol solution and the humidified gas were adjusted to during the conditioning the current was gradually increased at the rate of per until the cell voltage reached at in galvanostatic mode by the electrochemical instrument by repeating this procedure the steady state current cell voltage v curve was obtained the cell temperature was then increased to and and the above procedure was conducted in this case the temperatures of the supplied methanol and gas were the same as the cell temperature thus the mea conditioning was accomplished after the conditioning the dmfc power generation was conducted at the cell temperatures of and during the power generation the v current power p and current potential e curves were measured by feeding or mol dm methanol solution to the anode and the fully humidified gas to the cathode at the same temperature as the cell temperature the other measuring conditions were identical to those used for the mea conditioning temperature first the dmfc performances were evaluated at the cell temperatures of and figure shows the v upper and p lower curves measured by feeding and mol dm methanol to the anode in the case of and mol dm methanol concentrations the cell voltages are measured to the higher current density according to the increase in the temperature as shown in figs and in these cases from the p curves in figs and the power densities measured at the same current densities are found to increase with the increasing cell temperature however when we compare the p curves at the same temperatures in figs and the maximum power densities obtained for the mol dm methanol are greater than those for the mol dm methanol as for the methanol concentration of mol dm from the v curves shown in fig the cell voltages measured at the same current densities are found to increase with the increasing cell temperature from to however when the cell temperature is increased to the cell voltages measured at the same current densities significantly decrease when compared to those at this result is reflected in the relationship between the maximum power density and the cell temperature shown in fig these results for the mol dm methanol concentration are different from those for the and mol dm methanol concentrations temperature dependence of anode and cathode next to clarify the reason why the temperature dependences of the dmfc performances observed in fig are different the temperature dependence of the anode and cathode characteristics measured during the power generation was evaluated before the evaluation to know the effect of the temperature on the potential of the ag ag so reference electrode introduced into the single cell the potential differences between the ag ag so electrode and normal hydrogen electrode nhe were measured at and in mol dm so solution the obtained results are listed in table which indicates that the ag ag so electrode potentials at and are estimated to be and vs nhe respectively subsequently to confirm the accuracy of the e curves measurement by the single cell having the ag ag so electrode the v curve was calculated by subtracting the cathode and anode potentials of the same current density in the e curves measured at by feeding the mol dm methanol the obtained v curve is plotted as the black circles in fig the white squares in the figure express the experimental result when we look at fig the two curves well agree demonstrating that the ag ag so electrode is not influenced even by the high concentration methanol and an ohmic loss in the membrane is negligible based on the above results the e curves were observed during the power generation by feeding the or mol dm methanol figure shows the e curves measured at black symbols blue symbols and red symbols in fig which was measured during feeding mol dm methanol to the anode the methanol oxidation curves expressed as the open symbols show that the current densities observed at the same electrode potentials increase in the order of and moreover when we look at the solid symbols corresponding to reduction curves the current densities measured at the same electrode potentials increase with the increasing cell temperature these results indicate that both the methanol oxidation performance at the anode and the reduction performance at the cathode are enhanced by increasing the cell temperature the e curves measured while feeding mol dm methanol are shown in fig in this figure the methanol oxidation current densities measured at the same electrode potentials increase with the increasing cell temperature the reduction curves also indicate that the reduction current densities at the same electrode potentials increase according to the increase in the temperature these results demonstrate that the increased cell temperature enhances the methanol oxidation and reduction performances this result is similar to that for the mol dm methanol in fig however when we compare the reduction curves observed at the same temperature in figs and the onset potentials of the reduction for the mol dm methanol are more negative than those for mol dm methanol this potential shift suggests that the increased methanol concentration increases the extent of the methanol crossover which reduces the reduction performance at the cathode for the mol dm methanol from the e curves shown in fig the methanol oxidation and reduction current densities are found to be increased by increasing the cell temperature from to however when the cell temperature is increased to the methanol oxidation and reduction current densities measured at the same electrode potentials are reduced as compared to those at furthermore based on the reduction curves the negative shift in the onset potential of the reduction is observed these results indicate that for the mol dm methanol the methanol oxidation and reduction performances decline when the cell temperature is this result is different from those for the and mol dm methanol concentrations methanol concentration dependence of dmfc performances and its e the results in figs and indicate that the temperature dependence of the dmfc performance and its polarization characteristics for the mol dm methanol are different from those for the and mol dm methanol concentrations to clarify the factor causing the result as described above the dmfc performances and its polarization characteristics at and were further compared the results obtained at are shown in the left panels of fig in fig the v curves the cell voltages measured at the same current densities slightly decrease with the increasing methanol concentration in this case the p curves in fig also indicate that the maximum power density decreases in the order of mol dm these results imply that at the increased methanol concentration leads to lower decline in the dmfc performance rather than an increase in the power density the reason for this decline in the dmfc performance was considered from the e curves shown in fig in the methanol oxidation curves expressed by the open symbols the current densities measured at the same electrode potentials increase with the increasing methanol concentration indicating an enhancement of the methanol oxidation performance at the anode however as explained in the results of figs and the dmfc performance declines by increasing the methanol concentration based on this result any improvement in the methanol oxidation performance at the anode only slightly affects the dmfc performance on the other hand the solid symbols in fig show that the reduction curve shifts in the negative potential direction according to the increase in the methanol concentration this result indicates that the reduction performance at the cathode is decreased by the increased methanol crossover at the higher methanol concentration which is the main factor causing the decline of the dmfc performance shown in figs and the v and p curves measured at are shown in figs and respectively in fig the v curves for the mol dm methanol show that the cell voltage reaches when the current density is ca ma cm for the mol dm methanol the current density at decreases to ca ma cm as for the mol dm methanol the current density at is ma cm which is times that for the mol dm methanol when we look at the p curves in fig the decrease in the maximum power density is observed between the and mol dm methanol concentrations furthermore when the methanol concentration is increased from to mol dm the obtained maximum power density drastically decreases these results indicate that the dmfc performance at decreases due to the increase in the methanol concentration the extent of this decreasing effect is especially high for the mol dm methanol the e curves used to explain the methanol concentration dependence of the dmfc performance at are shown in fig in this figure the reduction curve expressed as the solid symbols shifts in the negative potential direction with the increasing methanol concentration the rate of the negative shift at is greater than that at in fig suggesting that the methanol crossover occurs more easily at on the other hand in the methanol oxidation curves denoted by the open symbols in fig the current densities measured at the same electrode potentials are increased by the increasing methanol concentration from to mol dm however when the methanol concentration is increased from to mol dm the measured current densities are drastically decreased this result demonstrates that the methanol oxidation performance at the anode is significantly decreased by feeding the mol dm methanol the reason for this result is considered as follows for the nafion used in the mea the water uptake which is concerned with the membrane swelling is known to increase with the increasing temperature therefore the permeability of the nafion membrane enhances at the higher temperature because the water included in the membrane and its swelling affect the permeation this result implies that the crossleak from the cathode to the anode during the dmfc operation easily occurs at the high cell temperature on the other hand the pt ru used as the anode catalyst has an reduction activity as well as the high methanol oxidation activity as shown in fig the anode potential is sufficiently negative to the onset potential of the reduction reaction based on these results the methanol oxidation and the reduction are expected to competitively occur at the pt ru alloy during the dmfc power generation resulting in the mixed electrode potential between the two reactions at the anode this phenomenon leads to the decreased methanol oxidation performance of the pt ru alloy at however in fig the decline of the anode performance is limited to the mol dm methanol the nafion has been reported to greatly swell at the high methanol concentration from this fact it is considered that the crossleak during the power generation is significantly enhanced by feeding the high concentration methanol which particularly declines the anode characteristic for the mol dm methanol at consequently the decline in the methanol oxidation performance for the mol dm methanol shown in fig is assumed to be attributed to the crossleak from the cathode to the anode in this study the dmfc power generation measurements were conducted between and by feeding the methanol solutions over wide concentration range to the anode using single cell containing ag ag so reference electrode as result we succeeded in measuring the cell temperature and methanol concentration dependences of the dmfc performance and its polarization characteristics the obtained results are listed as follows when or mol dm methanol is supplied to the anode the dmfc performance enhances in the order of and whereas for the mol dm methanol the dmfc performance obtained at decreases when compared to those at and the e curves for the and mol dm methanol concentrations measured during the dmfc power generation show that the anode and cathode characteristics are gradually improved by increasing the cell temperature from to and however for the mol dm methanol the anode and cathode performances obtained at are lower than those at and when the methanol concentration dependences of the dmfc performance and the polarization characteristics are compared between and the significant decrease in the dmfc performance at is observed for the mol dm methanol this result is assumed to be attributed to the decreased reduction performance at the cathode due to methanol crossover and the decreased methanol oxidation performance at the anode due to the crossleak  we have fabricated ch nh pbi xclx perovskite thin films crystallized in situ on substrates of different natures g porosity wettability and investigated their photoluminescence properties we observe that the crystallization time and thin film structure are strongly influenced by the chemical nature and porosity of the substrate moreover we find that the mesoporous scaffold can tune the emissive properties of the semiconducting compound both in terms of spectral region and dynamics in particular perovskite crystallites grown in the nanometre size porous scaffold present shorter living and blue shifted emission with respect to the perovskite crystals which are free to grow without any constraints in the last two years perovskite based solar cells have been characterized by fast development achieving impressive power conversion efficiencies up to it has been demonstrated that organo lead halide perovskite can work efficiently in variety of device architectures going from dye sensitized concept in which the perovskite crystals replace the dye on the tio mesoporous scaffold to meso superstructured device architecture in which the tio is replaced by an al mesoporous scaffold proving that the perovskite crystals can also sustain charge transport as further evolution thin film architectures have been particularly successful demonstrating performances comparable to traditional inorganic thin film solar cells while we have borne witness to unbelievable progress and evolution of photovoltaic devices based on these materials the huge gap in understanding when moving from the pristine molecules to their embodiment in device can severely hamper their widespread adoption in optoelectronic applications from the literature it is clear that every preliminary test of these materials in device architectures has revealed exciting surprises however their working mechanisms remain remarkably obscure our poor understanding of the relationship between structure and optoelectronic properties is key shortcoming especially given that hybrid perovskites are intrinsically complex materials where the presence of various types of interactions and structural disorder may play an important role in the material properties the difficulty in predicting the response of these materials to the interaction with external stimuli makes it impossible to frame them as proper technology due to the critical role of structural interactions of the organic inorganic components different crystallization deposition methodologies can lead to crystals with identical nominal chemical composition but with different macroscopic opto electronic properties in this work we focus on the investigation of ch nh pbi xclx perovskite thin films crystallized in situ on substrates of different natures g porosity wettability and on their photoluminescence properties zno nanoparticles np of three different sizes nm nm and nm have been deposited by spin coating onto glass substrates in order to obtain about nm thick scaffolds with different porosities due to its low temperature processability this oxide has strong technological relevance in fact it has already been employed as selective contact in perovskite based solar cells both on rigid and flexible substrates showing good charge collection properties and overall performances comparable to the most commonly used tio at the same time mesoporous scaffold of al made of nm nanoparticles typically used in state of the art solar cells was prepared the metal organic perovskite films were fabricated by spin coating on each substrate the precursor solution consisting of ch nh and the pbcl dissolved in common solvent see the supplementary material for details on sample fabrication for substrates such as tio and al generally after the deposition of the precursors the perovskite layer looks yellowish and transparent meaning that the self assembling of the crystal has not yet taken place heat treatment at for is essential for initializing the nucleation of the crystallites thus enabling the formation of the perovskites we found that after spin coating on different zno substrates the layer looks brownish by eye and after min annealing at the ch nh pbi xclx is completely formed as confirmed by absorption spectra see insets in figure longer annealing time led to decomposition of the film the reduction in the annealing time suggests faster kinetic for the crystallization of the perovskites on zno substrates which can be mainly related to different surface chemistry figure shows the top view of the perovskite polycrystalline films while the perovskite crystals of ch nh pbi xclx are mainly formed in the al scaffold with limited coverage of the capping layer left on top of the mesoporous substrate fig the samples fabricated on the zno substrates show consistent capping layer figs d interestingly by changing the zno porosity it is possible to observe different crystalline macro structures in particular we observe that nucleation on nm zno np gives rise to interconnected structures figure of condensed domains in the range of few microns of diameter the structures obtained from nm zno np are different from the previous one in this case the capping layer is formed by islands with circular shape figure however the bridge like interconnections between these structures are missing and the coverage of the capping layer in this scaffold is less with respect to the nm scaffold showing more mesoporous regions different morphology is also reported for ch nh pbi xclx grown on nm zno substrate figure microns long fibril like structures are obtained these fibrils extend all over the substrate as disoriented mat overlapping each other zooming inside the fibrils crystalline structure partially oriented in the sense of the fibers with sub micron domains can be observed as shown in figure of the supplementary material these observations highlight critical issue for the in situ crystallization especially in porous substrate whose wettability will be affected not only by the chemical nature of the scaffold but also by its porosity directly after application of the precursor solution the pores will be wet by the solution with an excess of solution on top the ratio between infiltrated solution and excess solution on top will strongly depend on the wettability of the substrate in agreement with what we observe by measuring the surface free energy sfe of the scaffolds under investigation see table of the supplementary material we find that the al shows the highest sfe while for the zno scaffold it will increase with increasing the nanoparticle size in the initial stages of spin coating large quantity of solution flows off the substrate and as the spin coating proceeds the solvent will evaporate from the surface of the wet film setting up concentration gradient of the precursors within the film the precursors will be driven via diffusion into the pores with the loss of solvent and increasing concentration of course this process will critically affect the crystallization dynamics which can favor the stabilization of different phases in terms of crystals chemical composition structure and size we investigated how the substrate induced morphological changes affect the photophysical properties of these compounds by time resolved photoluminescence pl spectroscopy figure shows the pl decays taken from the samples shown in figure excited both from the capping layer side or the substrate side the decays are taken at the peak of the photoluminescence band see figure in the supplementary material few interesting observations can be highlighted overall the pl decays become shorter as the zno nanoparticles size becomes smaller moreover when comparing the decays upon excitation of the capping layer side and the substrate side one can also observe further shortening in the lifetime in the latter case similar dynamics can also be observed in the presence of mesoporous tio substrates see figure in the supplementary material as electron transfer from the perovskite to the zno is energetically favorable at first glance this can be attributed to more efficient electron transfer in the presence of larger density of interfaces due to the reduced average nanopores size however this conclusion does not appear really straightforward upon deeper analysis from the absorption spectra showed in the insets of figure we were able to estimate that the penetration depth of light at nm ranges from nm to nm thus exciting from the substrate side scaffold thickness nm ensures excitation of the perovskite nano crystallites grown exclusively within the oxide scaffold see pore filling in figure of the supplementary material comparing the decay probed from perovskites grown in al and zno scaffold both made from nm nanoparticles one should expect stronger pl quenching in the presence of the zno as al has large band gap which precludes charge transfer however for the nm zno nanoparticle based mesoporous substrate we do observe an even longer lifetime in order to further investigate this issue the pl decays from perovskite polycrystalline films grown on flat glass substrate on thin nm al mesoporous scaffold which will also present large fraction of capping layer and on thick nm mesoporous scaffold with very small fraction of capping layer were measured and shown in figure the lifetime becomes shorter and shorter as the scaffold thickness is increased e increasing the contribution of crystallites grown in the scaffold to the overall pl signal with respect to the contribution coming from the crystals of the capping layer schematic shown in figure figures and show photoluminescence maps collected from the perovskite polycrystalline film grown on an even thinner al scaffold nm exciting from the substrate side and capping layer side respectively these maps show that when changing the side of excitation we can selectively observe two emissive states one short living and blue shifted with respect to the other in particular we believe that the emission shown in figure arises from the superposition of two different contributions coming from the two layers in the thin film which get sequentially excited by the laser e the perovskite infiltrated into the mesoporous scaffold short living emission peaking around nm and the capping layer long living emission peaking at around nm this indicates that the shortening of the lifetime in presence of the scaffold is not simply due to pl quenching process but it is related to an intrinsic change in the crystallite optoelectronic properties in agreement with the absorption spectra taken from samples with similar architectures showing that the fully mesostructured film is characterized by blue shifted absorption onset with respect to the flat film ball et al have already demonstrated that the perovskite crystals present in the capping layer are larger in size going from less than nm in the scaffold where the crystal growth is constrained to crystals larger than nm when they are left to grow freely thus we propose that the capping layer and the mesostructured film may be considered as two different compounds with different photoluminescence properties in summary we demonstrate that the nature of the substrate critically affects the structural and optical properties of the perovskite films by changing the crystallization dynamics we have observed that the ch nh pbi xclx crystals form in only min on zno substrates this may have drawbacks in terms of control of the final thin film structure pl lifetime cannot be considered as an intrinsic property of the material due to the strong structure property relationship in the self assembled perovskites therefore the pl lifetime quenching is not necessarily good indicator for charge transfer at interfaces if the crystals structures are not entirely comparable at molecular and mesoscopic level  recent discussions concerning the continuation of moore law have focused on announcements by several major corporations to transition from traditional planar to new multi gate field effect transistor devices however the growth and progression of the semiconductor microelectronics industry over the previous decades has been largely driven by combined advances in new materials lithography and materials related process technologies looking forward it is therefore anticipated that new materials and materials technologies will continue to play significant role in both the pursuit of moore law and the evolution of the industry in this research update we discuss and illustrate some of the required and anticipated materials innovations that could potentially lead to the continuation of moore law for another decade or more we focus primarily on the innovations needed to achieve single digit nanometer technologies and illustrate how at these dimensions not only new materials but new metrologies and computational modeling will be needed in relentless pursuit of moore law the silicon microelectronics industry has in the past decade quietly entered into the realm of the nanometer and ushered in new era of products based on new nanoscale devices this transition has been greatly aided by new materials and materials technologies such as strained si low dielectrics cu damascene and high dielectrics that have facilitated continued scaling and performance gains for micro nano electronic products similarly the implementation of these new materials and technologies has benefited greatly from the availability of existing and newly invented metrologies for characterizing unique material properties and computational modeling capabilities for predicting material and device behavior at nanometer dimensions as the semiconductor industry looks to advance into the single digit nanometer regime new materials and material related technologies are again expected to play key role in particular and nanomaterials such as ge nanowires carbon nanotubes and graphene are extremely attractive both due to their nanometer size and excellent electrical properties aside from their dimensions meeting the desired size requirement for future technologies these and other nanomaterials are expected to also exhibit unique transport properties due to their dimensions approaching the length scales of electron and phonon scattering hence there is need to both characterize and model the full electrical optical mechanical and thermal property behavior of such nanoscale materials in order to harness their full potential unfortunately the characterization of materials with nanometer dimensions presents numerous challenges to many of the metrologies the semiconductor industry has come to rely on measurements that are routine for bulk crystals and nm thin films such as characterizing electron hole mobility and young modulus are no longer straightforward and require either significant advancements in existing metrologies or the invention of all new metrologies additionally many of the new device types being discussed for the post cmos era rely on new information storage mechanisms such as manipulating electron spin oxidation state etc and require the invention of both new materials metrologies and computational models in order to achieve success it is also anticipated that as device and interconnect structures approach single digit nanometer dimensions interfacial properties and effects will increase in significance and start to overcome the importance of bulk properties therefore new metrologies sensitive exclusively to interfacial properties will additionally be needed in this research update we therefore highlight some of the key areas where significant advancements in new materials metrology and modeling e are needed for the continuation of moore law into the single digit nanometer regime for both logic and memory devices and circuits as we will show the challenges are many and require advancements beyond just the transistor equally important to achieving single digit nanometer technologies will be addressing needs in areas such as metal interconnects lithography and packaging as the semiconductor industry annually details and publishes these needs in the international roadmap for semiconductors itrs we will focus on few key challenges in each of these areas that illustrate needs across the full electrical thermal mechanical and optical material property spectrum starting with continued scaling of traditional cmos devices for logic applications there is an intense search for variety of new materials to enhance various components of the transistor see figure one prime example would be insulating materials with dielectric constant significantly higher than the hfo based dielectric currently utilized as high gate dielectric materials with increasingly higher such as gdhfo or lagdo are required to increase gate capacitance and enable continued reductions in equivalent gate oxide thickness needed by traditional dennard device scaling additionally semiconductors with high electron and hole mobility are being investigated to replace silicon as the transistor channel material such high mobility alternate channel materials are sought not only to facilitate scaling to smaller device dimensions but also to potentially provide higher energy efficiency and power performance in future transistor technologies the primary alternate channel materials under consideration include traditional high mobility semiconductors such as ge gaas and ingaas unfortunately combining these materials with si process technology presents numerous material challenges including the reduction of defects in ge and iii epilayers doping the device regions obtaining low interfacial defect densities with high gate dielectrics forming low resistivity metal contacts discovering new metal gate work function materials and compatibility and integration with low cu interconnect formation additional alternate cmos channel materials include and analogues of si ge and iii s carbon nanotubes graphene and novel nanomaterials e mos mose ws as well as heterostructures and superlattices of these materials in addition to increased mobility such and materials offer the potential for ballistic transport devices however these d materials pose similar problems to above as well as additional challenges related to their nanometer dimensions and unique aspect ratios in this regard the very property that makes them most interesting in some cases e mobility also represents significant challenge to characterize while methods have been developed and established for characterizing the mobility of materials such as graphene the characterization of mobility in nanowire materials still represents significant challenge also while the resistance of nanowires is relatively easy to measure distinguishing the various materials parameters that contribute to resistance is still difficult furthermore integrating materials such as graphene on different substrates and establishing bandgap has proven extremely challenging to achieve without negatively impacting electron hole mobility so metrology and modeling is needed to understand bandgap opening and to determine the sources of mobility degradation due to these materials and interface interactions due to the above challenges with continued cmos device scaling the semiconductor industry is additionally exploring materials that could facilitate information processing using alternate charge or non charge based state variables such beyond cmos devices offer potential path for continued device scaling and dramatic increases in energy efficiency as well as applications in both logic and memory products number of such beyond cmos devices operate on the principle of information processing via the manipulation of an individual electron spin orientation or collection of spins in magnet beyond ferromagnetism the operation of many of these devices depend on variety of interesting magnetic spin and other phenomena such as magnetoresistance magnetostriction magnetoelectric coupling spin torque spin hall and mott metal insulator transitions accordingly variety of new ferromagnetic ferromagnetic semiconducting mutliferroic complex metal oxides and strongly correlated electron sce state materials are being considered whose nanoscale properties need to be characterized therefore the implementation of such devices present numerous materials engineering challenges at the nanometer scale the above spin based devices also present many new metrology and modeling challenges beyond the obvious needs to measure spin transport and lifetime in bulk and multilayered heterogeneous systems there is more acute need for high resolution imaging techniques that are both compatible with magnetic materials and capable of atomic scale imaging of magnetic domains and interfaces current commercial high resolution electron microscopes are challenged in this regard ideally such imaging techniques would be multimodal to maximize information return from both magnetic and non magnetic nanoscale objects and interfaces as the operation and reliability physics of such spin based devices is still in state of infancy significant advancements in computational modeling are also needed to understand such problems as spin transport through materials scattering at interfaces tunneling through barrier layers dynamics of domain wall motion and spin injection from ferromagnetic to semiconductor materials for devices based on complex metal oxide and sce materials operation is based on the coupling between variety of electric magnetic antiferromagnetic ferroelectric and magnetoelectric properties however these properties are all strongly affected by the presence and location of oxygen vacancies and cationic disorder metrologies and modeling are therefore needed to detect and characterize such point defects their extended interactions and correlate their resulting effects on the observed electric and magnetic behavior this is particularly challenging for electron and ion based spectroscopy and imaging techniques that can have tendency to alter the valence state of the metal cation for memory applications still wider range of new devices are being considered that also operate on the manipulation of new materials properties that in addition to spin include resistive switching electrochemical reduction and oxidation redox reactions and electromechanical actuation many of the materials envisioned for these devices involve new transition metal oxide macromolecular and molecular materials memory devices based on resistive switching and redox reactions exhibit similar sensitivities to oxygen vacancies and cationic disorder as mentioned above but are also dependent on the formation and elimination of conducting filaments that also require new metrologies to detect and modeling to understand for macromolecular and molecular devices significant research is needed to understand electronic and or ferroelectric properties charge transport contact resistances and environmental reliability degradation mechanisms all of the above new device technologies and material options must ultimately demonstrate the potential to enable high density devices and integrated products via compatibility with current lithographic technologies interconnect fabrication processes and packaging options these three areas also face numerous materials challenges for the continued progression of moore law interconnects in particular have unique nanoscale electrical thermal and mechanical challenges unlike cmos dennard device scaling in previous decades interconnect electrical performance actually degrades with dimensional scaling and can impose significant limitations on integrated circuit performance through critical path signal delay as the magnitude of these delays are proportional to the resistance and capacitance of the interconnect circuit new metal and dielectric materials are sought that respectively have reduced values of resistivity and dielectric constant relative to the current cu and low dielectric materials employed see figure the success of scaling resistance may lie in finding new materials processes and modeling methods that can help minimize grain boundary and surface interface scattering in this regard and materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes are again of interest due to the possibility of achieving ballistic transport the implementation of new materials with reduced dielectric constants in contrast depends on offsetting simultaneous reductions in thermal and mechanical properties that can lead to die cracking during packaging and other reliability issues success in this area would therefore be greatly aided by the development of new metrologies to enable the characterization and modeling of nanoscale thermal and mechanical structure property relationships at atomic level detail it is also important to note that low dielectric materials are of interest for reducing parasitic capacitances associated with spacer and trench isolation in various and transistor devices for these applications thermal and chemical stability during transistor fabrication represents an added challenge for candidate low materials recent interest in interconnects and stacking multiple integrated circuits die in single package also presents numerous material challenges and opportunities in the areas of die assembly and packaging the impetus in this case is to enable increasingly smaller form factors for mobile markets while simultaneously providing improved functionality and performance however the arising increased power density creates variety of thermal related issues and new solder and polymeric packaging materials are needed to support the thermal hierarchy of chip assembly while simultaneously meeting mechanical stress electrical performance and heat dissipation reliability requirements for solders lower melting point materials are needed to support multiple die attach operations and minimize thermally generated strains nano particle solders in particular appear to be one attractive option due to the reduced melting points they exhibit resulting from their increased surface volume ratio new polymeric materials that can meet similar requirements are also needed to serve as adhesives molding compounds and underfill and thermal interface materials here again nanomaterials such as cnts and graphene are again expected to play role by serving as additives in nano composite materials to lower coefficients of thermal expansion and improve thermal conductivity and mechanical properties the development of such nano composite materials would be greatly aided by multiscale computational modeling all of the above is dependent on the ability to lithographically define single digit nanometer size patterns in photoresist materials and in turn transfer those patterns into the materials of interest in this regard discussions within the industry of the lithography roadmap have been largely dominated by the readiness and availability of extreme ultra violet euv lithography the continuous slip in readiness of this technology has lead the industry to consider and adopt more expensive spacer defined double triple and even quadruple patterning schemes to enable nm and below technologies the huge complexity and extreme costs of extending these approaches down to the single digit nm regime using current nm immersion lithography represents an immense opportunity for complementary or alternate approaches thin film deposition and etching techniques that are supremely selective to either metal or dielectrics is one capability that could greatly simplify such multiple patterning strategies however beyond cost and complexity metrology techniques will also be needed to quickly image and non destructively monitor the critical dimensions of these nanometer scale structures the latter is particular challenge given the sensitivity that polymeric and other materials can exhibit to the charge current provided by electron beam based imaging techniques while scanned probe microscopy spm has shown some potential here neutral atom microscopy nam is another technique that looks extremely promising and has shown the potential to achieve the resolution and throughput required such development of nam techniques could also prove extremely beneficial to the imaging of low dielectrics and polymers in interconnect and packaging structures where electron beam sensitivity is also concern one intriguing materials related extension path for lithography is directed self assembly dsa of photoresist like polymeric materials dsa refers to the alignment of self assembled patterns with predictable shapes and dimensions within lithographically predefined pattern of greater pitch it relies on directed phase segregation of block co polymer materials where the alignment of the self assembled pattern is controlled by predefined chemical markers or structures that preferentially attract one of the polymers while significant progress has been made in demonstrating dsa in sparse patterns with domain sizes down to nm significant work still remains in improving line edge roughness and understanding etch contrast and pattern transfer mechanisms however one of the most serious challenges for dsa is measurement and control of pattern defect densities to cm and understanding the thermodynamic and process variables that control their formation since dsa films are extremely thin the thickness of the feature size and defects can form beneath the surface measurement of low defect densities over large areas is extremely challenging and new high throughput defect detection techniques are needed to enable progress to assist with improving dsa techniques are needed that can map surface energies and contact angles at the nanoscale and image and distinguish between different lamella in the segregated copolymer for the former chemical force spm has shown some potential but needs continued development the latter is more challenging due to the sensitivity of polymers to charge based imaging techniques and weak ray scattering due to the low electron density of carbon adoption of dsa will also ultimately require efficient models that can readily enable design of device components and circuit layout to be directly translated into dsa derived structures and ultimately predict device performance and defect formation focusing strictly on metrology the recent transition to transistor and interconnect structures implies the need for metrologies capable of measuring critical dimensions and detecting defects in nanoscale features ideally such metrologies would be non destructive provide real time characterization and be capable of monitoring local variations in properties of nanoscale materials at the wafer level in this regard electron tomography techniques utilizing transmission electron microscopes have consistently demonstrated sub nanometer resolution capabilities but suffer from unreasonably long times for completion of analysis tem and atomic resolution spm techniques also exhibit significant coupling between the probe and sample that complicates their use for other nanoscale property measurements and will require significant research to develop methods for decoupling these interactions ray scattering techniques in this regard may be more attractive but can also suffer tradeoffs in terms of source brightness measurement time and resolution nanometer scale device structures also require the ability to measure and map elemental composition of dopants and impurities at the atomic level tem based electron loss spectroscopy eels and atom probe tomography apt are the two leading techniques in this area but still require significant research and development tem eels in particular will be greatly aided by advances in aberration correction methods that will also help mitigate electron beam damage whereas apt would benefit from improved sample preparation techniques and image reconstruction algorithms finally conventional device scaling has benefited immensely from electrostatic and continuum modeling of various transistor and interconnect structures as the semiconductor industry approaches single digit nm dimensions atomic level knowledge of devices and materials will be required in this regard recent advances in modeling techniques now enable the representation of an entire d device with atomic resolution it is anticipated that such capabilities will help provide fundamental insights into optimization of both materials and device structures however effective use of computational material modeling to predict and simulate material and device behavior demands accurate knowledge of materials properties at the nanometer scale in this regard one of the most overlooked challenges in metrology is the need for valid nanoscale materials property values for use in computational models to extract material properties from complex heterogeneous structures in summary new materials metrologies and computational materials modeling are key to the continuation of moore law into the future and the achievement of more highly integrated powerful and world changing devices see table new nanoscale materials and materials processing technologies in particular may be needed both for continued dimensional scaling of traditional technologies as well as the realization of revolutionary device and interconnect structures with increased performance and or power efficiency in turn improved metrologies and computational modeling tools are needed to guide the evolution and evaluate the performance and reliability of new nanoscale materials and device and interconnect architectures  the current thin film photovoltaic pv technologies are dominated by cdte and cu in ga se compounds however due to the limited availably and toxicity of the elements in these technologies the current research efforts are directed to search alternative earth abundant materials therefore in this work we analyze the cusbs and cubis compounds as alternative absorber materials for future thin film solar cells employing first principles approach within the density functional theory we calculate the structural electronic and optical properties of cusbs and cubis compounds we show that these compounds have indirect fundamental band gap eg ev the indirect gap nature is different from the previous experimental measurements however due to the flat bands the direct gap egd ev is suitable for solar energy technologies furthermore calculations reveal that these compounds have strong absorption coefficients which are about twice as large as in other cu based pv materials like cuins and cu znsns therefore cusbs and cubis have the potential to be used as absorber materials in thin film pv technologies development of photovoltaic pv materials comprised of non toxic and earth abundant elements is utmost criterion to meet the increasing demands for electricity production the current thin film pv technologies are mostly dominated by two promising compounds e cdte and cu in ga se cigs however due to the increasing cost in ga supply problem in te and environmental issues cd these compounds are under question in future pv technologies alternative quaternary cu znsn se cztsse type compounds which contain abundant and inexpensive elements like cu zn sn and se are potential candidates for pv technologies however there are still challenges with this system related to the structural polymorphism and multivalence of sn it is therefore evident that more research is required to find the alternative inexpensive and earth abundant materials for efficient thin film solar cells recently it has been reported that thin film of cusbs grown by thermal evaporation method has promising properties such as direct band gap energy eg ev and strong absorption coefficient in earlier studies thin films of cusbs and cubis compounds grown by the various methods have also shown promising optical properties despite these promising properties thin films based on these materials have not yet reached to the device level therefore it is very essential to understand the fundamental physical properties of these cums sb and bi compounds which however are not yet well discussed it is true that the further analyses of pv materials require detailed understanding of its electronic and optical properties therefore in this article we systematically analyze the structural electronic and optical properties of cums compounds using first principles method within density functional theory dft hybrid functional which is known to accurately describe the lattice parameters band gap energies and total energy of the system is used in present study we find that cums compounds are indirect band gap semiconductors the fundamental band gap energy is estimated to be eg ev in cusbs and eg ev in cubis furthermore calculations reveal that these materials have strong optical absorption compared to well established cuins cis and cu znsns czts the strong absorption in these compounds is explained by the localized like states of cation sb bi in the conduction band cb region all the calculations are performed using the dft employing the projector augmented wave method as implemented in vienna ab initio simulation package vasp we use both the semilocal perdew burke ernzerhof pbe exchange correlation functional as well as the heyd scuseria ernzerhof hse screened hybrid functional in the latter method we choose the standard range separation parameter to decompose the coulomb kernel which is known to fairly describe the crystal volume and band gap energies plane wave cutoff energy of ev and monkhorst pack point mesh are used to give converged results the lattice constants are fully relaxed within the hse method using quasi newton algorithm by minimizing the total energy to an accuracy of mev and the ion positions were relaxed with an accuracy of ev for the forces on each atom the valence electrons include the and orbitals for cu and orbitals for sb bi and cums compounds crystallize in orthorhombic layered structure pnma space group no which differs from currently dominated cubic and tetragonal semiconductors fig shows the crystal structure of cums compounds with the four formula units in unit cell unit cell contains total atoms cums with cu sb bi and atoms and all these atoms occupy the wyckoff site the cations sb bi are four coordinated and the cu atoms are five coordinated with respect to the neighboring anion the calculated lattice parameters b and enthalpy of formation hf and band gap energy eg are listed in table it can be clearly seen that the lattice parameters agree well with the available experimental values and the use of the hybrid functional improves the reproduction of lattice parameters we also calculate the enthalpy of formation of these compounds with the help of their elemental standard as per equation given below cu sb hf cusbs and cu bi hf cubis here hf cusbs and hf cubis represent the formation energy of the compound cusbs and cubis respectively while cu and sb bi represent the chemical potential e total energy of the ground state solid atoms like fcc structured cu hexagonal structured and trigonal structured sb and bi respectively the enthalpy of formation for the above reaction is hf ev and ev for cusbs and cubis respectively using hse potential the enthalpy of formation is one of the useful parameters to understand thermodynamic functions of any new materials which indeed are very crucial for device applications one can see that the values are comparable to other cu based compounds hence this suggests that also the cusbs and cubis are thermodynamically stable electronic in this section we discuss the electronic properties of cums compounds from both the electronic band structure and density of states dos point of view fig shows the electronic band structure along the main symmetry directions for cusbs and cubis both these compounds show rather similar band structure except the location of the valence band vb maxima and cb minima the vb maxima is located between the point and point for both compounds while cb minima is located between r and regions for cusbs fig and cubis fig respectively these compounds have thus indirect gap which is in contrast with the common perception of experimental measurements where direct nature of band gap has been predicted our estimated fundamental band gap using hse potential eg ev for cusbs and eg ev for cubis are in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical studies on the other hand estimated smallest direct band gap energies egd in cusbs and egd ev in cubis are only ev larger than the corresponding fundamental gap energies therefore despite an indirect band gaps in cums compounds the onset to optical absorption occurs at similar energy as the fundamental gap energy and it is not surprising if experimental analysis suggests that the materials have direct gap there is discrepancy also in the experimental band gap values as it varies considerably table generally parabolic band approximation is used to determine the band gap energy from optical measurements and this approximation may lead to incorrect interpretation if the bands are non parabolic one can see from fig that the topmost vb and the lowest cb have relatively flat dispersions and this could be the one reason for incorrect interpolation of experimental band gap second one may also expect that the film growth conditions and the presence absence of impurities or defects may lead to variation in the experimental band gap as such behaviors have been reported for cigs compound moreover the band gap of semiconductors is typically ev smaller at room temperature than the zero temperature values and also the theoretical gap energy should be considered as an estimate and we expect that hse generates variation of ev in band gap values in order to analyze the chemical bonding fig shows the atomic and angular resolved dos of cusbs fig and cubis fig compounds it is clear that the dos for these compounds are rather similar and overall features of the curves are same except the energy range and the shape of peaks the vb of these compounds is mainly composed of cu and p similar to other cu based semiconductors cigs and cztsse on the other hand the cb is composed mainly of sb bi states the strong like states of trivalent cation e sb or bi are very localized and this is the main reason that top of cb in cums compounds are much sharper compared to cigs or cztsse compounds where it is more broaden optical properties play very important role to understand materials suitability for solar cell applications the study on the optical properties is here based on the absorption coefficient and which is obtained directly from the dielectric function by where is the speed of light fig represents the calculated average polarization independent absorption coefficients of cums compounds calculation reveals almost similar optical absorption coefficient for both compounds except strong absorption for cubis around ev furthermore absorption measurement fig reveals an optical band gap energy egopt ev for these compounds hence our results suggest that further experimental and theory investigations are required to establish the exact value of the gap energy the absorption coefficients for ev are cm for cusbs and cm for cubis the larger value for cubise is due to smaller band gap we also calculate the absorption coefficient of established cu based pv materials such as cis and czts for better comparison we shift the energy scale by the respective band gap energies so that onset to absorption occurs at zero energy and are shown in fig one can see from fig that these cums compounds have strong absorption compared to cis and czts the absorption coefficient for eg ev is cm for cusbs and for cubis cm respectively hence it shows that these compounds have comparable on the other hand the corresponding values for cis and czts are and cm respectively thus the absorption coefficients of cusbs and cubis compounds are about twice as large as in the conventional cu based pv materials one reason for this is the flat dispersion of the cb fig and which is due to the localized like states of sb and bi in cb region fig hence it shows that the cusbs and cubis can be regarded as potential absorber materials for inexpensive thin film pv technologies the electronic and optical properties of cusbs and cubis have been studied theoretically it has been found that these materials have indirect band gap which is in contrast to the experimental measurements direct band gap the fundamental band gap energy is estimated to be eg ev furthermore the difference between the fundamental gap and the lowest direct gap energy is only ev therefore despite an indirect gap one can expect strong absorption in cums compounds and hence the direct gap energy egd ev is suitable for solar energy technologies analysis shows that these compounds have much stronger absorption coefficients compared to other cu based pv materials which is desire characteristic for any potential absorber material overall these compounds have promising electronic and optical properties to be used as absorber material for solar cell applications  a review is presented of the present status of the theory the developed technology and the current applications of dielectrophoresis dep over the past years around publications have addressed these three aspects and current trends suggest that the theory and technology have matured sufficiently for most effort to now be directed towards applying dep to unmet needs in such areas as biosensors cell therapeutics drug discovery medical diagnostics microfluidics nanoassembly and particle filtration the dipole approximation to describe the dep force acting on particle subjected to nonuniform electric field has evolved to include multipole contributions the perturbing effects arising from interactions with other cells and boundary surfaces and the influence of electrical double layer polarizations that must be considered for nanoparticles theoretical modelling of the electric field gradients generated by different electrode designs has also reached an advanced state advances in the technology include the development of sophisticated electrode designs along with the introduction of new materials g silicone polymers dry film resist and methods for fabricating the electrodes and microfluidics of dep devices photo and electron beam lithography laser ablation thin film techniques cmos technology around three quarters of the or so scientific publications now being published each year on dep are directed towards practical applications and this is matched with an increasing number of patent applications summary of the us patents granted since january is given along with an outline of the small number of perceived industrial applications g mineral separation micropolishing manipulation and dispensing of fluid droplets manipulation and assembly of micro components the technology has also advanced sufficiently for dep to be used as tool to manipulate nanoparticles g carbon nanotubes nano wires gold and metal oxide nanoparticles for the fabrication of devices and sensors most efforts are now being directed towards biomedical applications such as the spatial manipulation and selective separation enrichment of target cells or bacteria high throughput molecular screening biosensors immunoassays and the artificial engineering of three dimensional cell constructs dep is able to manipulate and sort cells without the need for biochemical labels or other bioengineered tags and without contact to any surfaces this opens up potentially important applications of dep as tool to address an unmet need in stem cell research and therapy the term dielectrophoresis dep first adopted by pohl implies from the greek word phorein an effect where particle is carried as result of its dielectric properties pohl defined this effect as the motion of suspensoid particles relative to that of the solvent resulting from polarization forces produced by an inhomogeneous electric field the effect was in fact known to the ancient greeks and romans according to mottelay ref thales of miletus described it approximately c in observations that vigorously rubbed pieces of amber can attract straws dried leaves and other light bodies in the same way that magnet attracts iron the first theoretical treatment of the ponderomotive forces acting on dielectric spheres in an inhomogeneous electric field followed maxwell theories g ref pp and hatfield appears to be the first to exploit the effect for the treatment of tin ores where the valuable mineral cassiterite has to be separated from large excess of quartz material hatfield recognized that key experimental problem was the generation of intense nonuniform electric fields having strengths even remotely approaching that of the weakest magnetic fields used in magnetic separation without problems associated with dielectric breakdown pohl initial interest in this subject was also directed toward an industrial application and in particular to the problem of removing carbon black filler from polyvinyl chloride samples he later directed his efforts to the development of methods and theories for the dielectrophoretic characterization and separation of biological cells and bacteria as described in his seminal book on the subject it took time for the term to gain universal recognition the title of paper was changed to include the words measurements using nonuniform electric field effects because referee insisted there was no such word as dielectrophoresis as shown in fig there has been significant increase in the number of dep publications over the past decade leveling off if the estimate for is roughly correct search of databases medline sciencedirect web of science generates details of nearly publications excluding conference reports and patents in this field of study over the past years the total number in the decade leading up to was less than the papers cover various aspects of the theory and technology published applications of dep are directed toward areas such as biosensors cell therapeutics drug discovery medical diagnostics microfluidics nanoassembly and particle filtration characterizing the content of paper in terms of whether it can be categorized as addressing the theory technology or application of dep is sometimes not straightforward many key papers address all three aspects however an attempt to do this is shown in fig current trends suggest that the theory and technology have matured sufficiently for most effort to now be directed toward applying dep to solve unmet practical needs in this review an attempt is made to describe the present status of the theory technology and applications of dep it is not intended to be comprehensive review of all the papers published but takes the form of an expanded version of introductory notes supplied to masters and doctoral students about to engage in various aspects of dep research it is hoped that established researchers in the field together with those requiring detailed introduction g lecturers patent examiners venture capitalists will also find it of use and interest references are given to key papers some of them published many years ago this reflects strong empathy with the sentiment expressed by james clerk maxwell that it is of great advantage to the student of any subject to read in the original memoirs on that subject for science is always most completely assimilated when it is found in its nascent state every student should in fact be an antiquary in his subject ref frontispiece most publications on dep quote an expression for the time average dep force acting on spherical particle of the formfdep mr cm where is the absolute permittivity o of the surrounding medium is the particle radius cm is the clausius mossotti factor related to the effective polarizability of the particle is the amplitude rms of the electric field and represents the gradient operator although clausius and mossotti did not derive this factor in this context the factor is named after them in recognition of their early studies of the relationships between the dielectric constant and refractive indices of different materials this led to the recognition that the factor should be proportional to the density of material in reviewing the status of dep theory it is instructive to examine how eq is derived the first step involves evaluating the polarization of the particle in terms of an equivalent induced dipole moment we conduct the imaginary exercise of inserting lossless dielectric sphere of radius and absolute permittivity into fluid dielectric medium of permittivity that occupies the whole of the rest of space we suppose that uniform field directed along the positive axis existed in this dielectric before insertion of the sphere our task is to deduce the form of particle polarization whose field when superposed onto produces resultant potential that satisfies the following standard conditions in the formulation of electrostatic problems ref on either side of the sphere surface the normal component of the gradient of changes such that remains constant is continuous across this boundary defined by the sphere surface in all of the space satisfies laplace equation we also make the condition at distances far beyond the sphere ex if the sphere consists of an isotropic and homogeneous dielectric it will be homogeneously polarized by the external field to create an internal field ei symmetric about the axis eix eir cos polar coordinates r cos we represent this polarization as an induced dipole of effective moment ke located at the sphere center fig as result of the spherical geometry and the lossless nature of the dielectric this induced dipole moment will be aligned with the original external field thus for all space outside the sphere the field created by this dipole is superposed onto the field to give ex ek mr xr cos k mr the forms given for in eqs and satisfy condition iii while boundary conditions and ii require o and i m r when r thus ei k mr and pei me mr on solving for we obtain the sphere induced dipole moment asp ke mr m m the dep force acting on the polarized sphere when it is now subjected to nonuniform field is the algebraic sum of the forces acting on the positive and negative elements of the induced dipole moment on performing taylor series expansion of x about and taking the effective length of the dipole shown in fig as r e q thenedep e r x nn ne qe if the particle diameter is much smaller than the scale of the field nonuniformity we can ignore the higher order terms to give to good approximation edep r x e on substitution of from eq into eq we obtainfdep mr m m e mr m m this result is equivalent to eq with the cm factorcm m m equation is presented in classical texts on electrostatics g ref pp well before the term dep was introduced we can interpret this result in terms of electrostatic energy with the factor mr cm being proportional to the energy required to withdraw sphere of radius from field into region where there is no field assuming that the medium is isotropic and linear such that may be function of position but not of the field a positive value for cm indicates that work will be required to withdraw the particle from the highest field region whereas for negative cm value work is required to push the particle from low to high field region the dependence on indicates that dep is ponderomotive particle volume dependent effect we now note that the formulation of eq involves the following simplifications the particle is composed of homogeneous dielectric that exhibits no conductive losses and carries no net charge the nonuniform nature of the applied field is not taken into account in the derivation of the particle induced polarization which is assumed to take the form of simple dipole moment the particle exists in dielectric medium of infinite extent implying that the field in the vicinity of the particle is not perturbed by the presence of boundary such as metal or dielectric surface or another polarizable particle for example before reviewing the consequences of these approximations and how the derivation of dep forces can be improved we note that eq accurately informs us the following the dep force is zero if the field is uniform e for the dep force is ponderomotive with all other factors remaining constant the larger the particle volume the greater will be the dep force acting on it the induced dipole moment is either aligned with or directed against the applied field depending on whether the particle permittivity is greater or less than that of the surrounding medium respectively this corresponds to positive or negative dep where particle is attracted to or repelled from region of high electric field strength respectively the dep force depends on the square of the applied field magnitude indicating that dep can be observed using either dc or ac field electrode geometry is an important experimental factor in the control of the factor e which has dimensions of m value for this factor of m can induce significant dep force on biological cells for example using suitably scaled microelectrodes and applied voltages of the order particle inhomogeneity conductive particles such as bacteria and cells exhibit conductivity associated with mobile ions in their structures and their suspending medium is usually conducting electrolyte when ac fields are applied these conduction losses are accommodated in the form of either complex permittivity p p p or complex conductivity p j p where is the imaginary vector and is the angular frequency of the applied ac field the cm factor given by eq can thus be expressed as complex function using either of the two equivalent forms cm m m or cm m m the total current in the particle can be considered to comprise two elements one associated with field induced movement of free charges and the other arising from the field induced perturbation of bound charges at low frequencies the current is dominated by the conduction of free charges and there is essentially no phase difference between the field and the current at high frequencies the dielectric displacement current dominates and the particle acts like capacitor with the current leading the applied field by phase angle close to radians the instantaneous value of the applied field at location and time is given bye t re r ej where re signifies that the real part of the expression is to be used ej e cos j sin so that re e cos im e sin where im is the imaginary part from eqs and the instantaneous effective dipole moment value at time becomesp re mr cm r ej from eq the time dependent expression for the dep force is thusfdep re pejwt re eejwt substituting for the effective dipole moment from eq we obtain the time average dep force acting on lossy homogeneous spherical particle of radius as fdep mr re cm at frequencies below khz re cm p p and for frequencies above mhz re cm p p at low frequencies the dep force thus depends on the conductive properties of the particle and suspending medium while at high frequencies the permittivity values are important at intermediate frequencies both the conductive and dielectric properties of the medium and particle dictate the magnitude and polarity of the dep force continuity of the displacement flux density across the interface between the particle and the fluid medium eq controls the initial temporal response equivalent to the high frequency response to an applied electric field and because this involves perturbations of bound charges at the atomic and molecular scale is independent of particle size with increasing time after application of the field equivalent to lower frequency response as conduction effects appear continuity of current density mem pei must now be maintained across the particle medium interface charges will build up at the particle medium interface process referred to as maxwell wagner interfacial polarization named after maxwell original mixture theory and wagner modification to include ac fields this polarization involves the macroscopic movement of free charges mainly ions around and through the particle and so does depend on particle size and the effective surface area over which the particle conductive and capacitive properties are expressed we can estimate the frequency where the displacement dielectric polarization current takes over from the conduction current regime and charges begin to accumulate at particle surfaces from the relaxation time ref for an aqueous medium of conductivity of ms a value typical for dep experiments on cells the value for is corresponding to frequency of mhz if the medium is physiological strength buffer m this transition frequency rises to mhz the relaxation time for the maxwell wagner interfacial polarization is ref mw m m so far we have considered the case of dep arising from either dc or stationary ac fields the time averaged dep force acting on particle arises from the interaction of the induced dipole moment with the applied field phasor in other words both the magnitude and phase of the various field components should be taken into account this is summarized by the following equation fdep mr re cm im cm where represents summation involving the magnitude and phase of each field component in cartesian coordinate frame this is the dep force that acts in traveling wave dep experiments g ref most particles especially biological ones are not homogeneous bacteria and cells can be modeled to take account of their heterogeneous structures using the so called multishell model erythrocytes are usually discoid in shape but when suspended in an electrolyte they often take the form of spherical particle about in diameter and can be represented as thin spherical membrane e single shell surrounding the cytoplasm to represent cells such as leukocytes which possess nucleus we require three shell model first shell the plasma membrane second shell the cytoplasm and third shell the membrane envelope surrounding the nucleoplasm the multishell model has been extended to describe nonspherical shells and to account for the dielectric anisotropy of the plasma membrane maxwell wagner polarizations will take place at the interfaces between the various shells and the magnitudes and temporal dynamics of these various polarizations will depend on the dielectric properties of the materials that make up these shells the cm function for multishell particle can be obtained by evaluating effective values for the relative complex permittivity or conductivity of the particle the term effective is used to signify that heterogeneous multishell particle may be replaced conceptually with one having homogeneous smeared out bulk properties such that substitution of one particle with the other would not alter the electric field in the surrounding medium the progressive simplification of nucleated cell to simple homogeneous sphere is depicted in fig and method for achieving this that employs equations readily adaptable to computer modeling has been formulated by huang et al thus for human erythrocyte we can use the single shell model and its effective complex permittivity is given by mem r cyt mem cyt mem r cyt mem cyt mem in which mem is the complex permittivity of the plasma membrane cyt is the effective complex permittivity of the cell interior e the cytoplasm for an erythrocyte is the outer radius of the cell and is the plasma membrane thickness the modeling replaces with the membrane capacitance cm mem this will be discussed in more detail in sec to follow the corresponding cm function is then obtained by substituting this effective value for into eq equation and versions of it to accommodate cells having nucleus or bacteria and plant cells possessing cell wall and or vacuole can be used with eqs and to model the expected dep behavior of cells over wide frequency range examples of dep responses modeled for viable cell are given in fig and show clearly the effect first observed by ber that with increasing frequency the dielectric properties of cell with an intact nonconducting membrane approaches that of conducting sphere the dep force shown for two values of the cell radius makes the transition from negative to positive value at cross over frequency fxo although fxo is sensitive to the size of the cell we can see from fig that the frequency fhxo where the dep force can reverse polarity again at higher frequency does not change with cell size this agrees with the discussion above that establishing continuity of current density is low frequency macroscopic process involving ionic conduction within and around the particle and therefore depends on particle size while at higher frequencies microscopic dielectric polarizations are dominant this fundamental difference in the physicochemical properties that govern the two cross over frequencies fxo and fhxo is also illustrated in fig which demonstrates that fxo is sensitive to changes of the surrounding medium conductivity whereas fhxo does not respond to such changes at the high frequencies the membrane capacitance effectively shorts out the high resistance of the cell membrane and the dep response depends on the relative differences between the permittivities of the cell interior and the surrounding medium in principle the different materials that make up the various shells in the dielectric model should each exhibit dielectric dispersion given approximately by the well known debye single relaxation expression s where and are the low frequency and high frequency limits of the permittivity respectively and is the mean relaxation time ref however over the frequency range from around khz to mhz the cell plasma membrane and the suspending medium if it consists essentially of weak electrolyte should not exhibit dielectric dispersions of any significance the cytoplasm will exhibit dispersions related to the presence of small bodies g mitochondria protein structures and solvated proteins amino acids and other biopolymers such dielectric dispersions when incorporated into the multishell model introduce relatively small modifications to the overall dep spectrum and can slightly influence the high frequency dep cross over frequency fhxo particles generally carry net charge associated with the presence of charged polymers and or ionizable acidic and basic groups on their surfaces early studies demonstrated that the low frequency dep response for erythrocytes and erythroleukemia cells was affected following neuraminidase treatment to reduce their cell membrane charge by the fixed charge on the surface of particle can influence its dep behavior through electrophoresis and counterion relaxations and conduction in the double layer that forms around all charged particles when they are suspended in aqueous media evidence for an electrophoretic contribution to the low frequency hz dep response of suspension of bacteria was observed by burt et al but inertial constraints will render such contributions to be insignificant at higher frequencies even for very small particles counterion relaxation processes involving both ionic diffusion and ionic conduction around particle surfaces will however contribute to the total polarizability and influence the dep response for frequencies up to mhz comprehensive treatment of electrical double layer polarizations is given by lyklema in summary the electrical double layer can be considered to consist of two classes of counterions those strongly attracted to the fixed charges on the particle surface termed the stern layer and those more loosely associated in the diffuse outer layer where the electrical potential of the charged particle approaches that of the surrounding bulk medium with increasing distance from the particle surface the physical boundary between these two populations of counterions can be considered to be the so called slip plane at the zeta potential where charged particle plus its stern layer separates from the outer diffuse population of counterions during electrophoresis the influence of the electrical double layer on dep behavior is particularly important for nanoparticles where the thickness of the electrical double layer can approach or even exceed the particle physical diameter field induced mobility of counterions in the double layer gives rise to surface conductance ks typically ns whose influence on the overall polarizability can exceed that of the bulk conductivity bulk the total conductivity of particle can be described as the sum of its bulk and surface conductivity bulk ksr this relationship demonstrates that the influence of ks can dominate over the bulk conductivity for very small particles counterions are more mobile in the diffuse layer than in the stern layer and contribute separately to the overall magnitude of ks and thus to the dep behavior of nanoparticles comprehensive study of the ac and dc electrokinetic properties of latex nanoparticles as function of suspending medium conductivity and viscosity has been reported by ermolina and morgan and theoretical modeling of the dep force that takes into account the influence of the electrical double layer has been presented by zhou et al analysis of the normal and tangential ionic currents that occur around and at the surface of particle when its diameter approaches and becomes smaller than the width of its own electrical double layer indicates that capacitance effect contributes to the total polarizability of the particle and exceeds the influence of the surface conductance ks basuray and chang also showed that the dep cross over frequency for nanocolloids is inversely proportional to the rc time constant of the diffuse layer component of the electrical double layer this is considered to offer sensitive method for detecting the hybridization of target molecules onto functionalized nanocolloid probes based on the change of the surface conductance of these probes and the corresponding change of their dep cross over frequency hoffman and zhu and hoffman et al demonstrated that electrical double layer effects influence the way nanoparticles aggregate under the influence of dep force equation is referred to as the dipole approximation for the dep force because it is based on the assumption that the field nonuniformity is large enough to create significant dep force on the particle but that the field does not vary so strongly throughout the particle as to induce within it polarization not properly described by eq uniform polarization of the particle is assumed and represented as an induced dipole moment located at the particle center g ref ref in reality the response of dielectric to an imposed electric field involves the polarization of its constituent atoms molecules distributed as continuous function of position whose polarizations will be sensitive to the value of the local electric field an inhomogeneous field will result in an inhomogeneous polarization of dielectric the treatment of the polarization of particle in nonuniform field can be refined by incorporating an important theorem in electrostatics which states that the potential generated outside an uncharged sphere by an arbitrary distribution of charges within it is identical with the potential of system of multipoles pn is point charge is the dipole and so on located at its center ref pp jones in his book electromechanics of particles gives an excellent treatment of how the forces and torques experienced by particles subjected to electric and or magnetic fields can be understood in terms of multipole theory multipoles can be distributed along an axis of symmetry in particle or take more general form as shown in fig for the linear quadrupole shown in fig located on and aligned with the field along the axis it is straightforward to derive the directed dep force asfdepn e d x x qd x for the octupole shown in fig we havefdepn e d x e d x qd x only nth order taylor series terms survive these calculations and so for the general nth order linear multipole we havefdepn qdn ne xn the more general multipoles are treated by washizu and jones green and jones provide method for determining the linear multipoles up to the ninth order for range of particle shapes other than spheres ellipsoids truncated cylinders and an approximation of an erythrocyte for the situation where the particle is subjected to an arbitrary nonuniform field we are required to derive resultant potential that satisfies the standard boundary conditions as well as laplace equation equation is thus replaced to give more general expression for the potential generated outside the sphere by system of multipoles located within it ex n the partial potential of the general multipole pn of nth order is given by mpnynrn in which pn qdn and yn involves legendre polynomial function determined by the spherical coordinates defining the multipole geometry ref pp thus the potentials of higher order moments fall off more rapidly with distance than for dipole versus for quadrupole for example and so their relative importance increases with increasing field nonuniformity the first report of dep force calculation to include the higher order components of an arbitrary field and the induced multipole moments is that of washizu who illustrated the importance of this for the quadrupole polynomial electrode design shown in fig particles can be directed into the central location and slightly levitated above the plane of these electrodes by negative dep force at this central location the factor is zero and so no dep force can be exerted washizu demonstrated that in this situation and especially for distances less than the particle radius from the center the induced quadrupole moment should be included in the dep force calculation however for distances far from the center the dipole approximation gives accurate results this condition is readily satisfied by taking dep measurements on cells located nearer to the quadrupole electrode edges than to the central location the importance of higher order moments was also found to apply to azimuthally periodic electrode structures used to achieve passive dep levitation of particles where pronounced size dependent effect not anticipated by the conventional dipole based theory was observed higher order moments are responsible for the levitation force achieved by such electrode structures because the electric field is zero along the central axis and so the induced dipole moment is zero schnelle et al investigated the situation for dep field cages formed by sandwich structure of two planar quadrupole electrode structures fig and concluded that quadrupole moment forces contribute of the total dep force for particles larger than about quarter of the electrode spacing for particles smaller in diameter than about tenth of the electrode spacing the error arising from dep force calculation that ignores the quadrupole contribution is typically smaller than for spherical dielectric particle of radius with complex permittivity suspended in medium of permittivity and subjected to sinusoidal steady state electric field vector the effective nth order multipolar moment is tensor phasor of the form pn mr n cm n cm is the general multipole form of the cm factor given bycm p n n the general time average expression for the dep force acting on the nth order multipole is thus fdepn re pn nen where represents dot products performed on the dyadic tensors and represents vector operations this multipolar analysis was also applied by jones and washizu to traveling wave dep the important conclusion was also reached that the various multipolar dep forces show similar frequency dependencies and so will not influence the interpretation of dep cross over measurements or cell separation protocols that are based on such measurements g ref washizu extended the multipole moment analysis of the dep force to the case of spherical particles being manipulated by focused laser beams e optical tweezers the overall time average dep force is summation of the multipole contributions fdep re pn nen for the case of an axially symmetric nonuniform field acting on sphere and including only the dipole and quadrupole contributions we have fdep mr re m m mr re m m for small particles the first dipole force term dominates the overall dep force while for larger particles the quadrupole term becomes important it is usually the case that during dep experiments many of the particles are close to an electrode or channel surface or interact to form pearl chains oriented along field lines the dep behavior of isolated cells can be different from those that form doublets triplets or higher order aggregates and those that are close to metal or dielectric boundaries the influence of neighboring particle can be appreciated from the following simple example based on model described by stoy instead of considering single sphere inserted into an infinite medium and imposed uniform field we consider the case of two identical spheres placed distance apart along the axis and collinear with the field we place the center of sphere at the origin of the spherical coordinate system employed for eq sphere now experiences net field given bye cm sphere now sees this added field from sphere and produces an induced dipole moment m cm cm cm sphere will now see this field created by the induced dipole of sphere if this procedure is repeated ad infinitum we obtain the interactive dipole moments and in closed form p cm cm each sphere distorts the local field of the other and the mutual attractive dep force acting on them is fdep fdep p md only when the spheres are more than radius apart will the major contribution to this mutual dep force come from the dipole dipole interaction as the spheres approach more closely and then touch the dep force between them will depend upon the interaction of all the multipoles in sphere with all the multipoles in sphere stoy extended his model to compute the dep force between identical touching spheres in parallel field to include up to interactive linear multipoles the dep force between two lossy particles in lossy medium incorporating multipoles polarized by an external field has been treated by sancho et al multiple image approximation has been employed to study the polarization spectra of pair of touching cells and colloidal particles these studies were restricted to plain spherical particles aligned with the direction of the electric field the practical calculation of the interaction requires truncation of expansions at some finite number of terms and is affected by convergence problems when particles have high permittivity or they are closely spaced giner et al employed the dipole approximation for heterogeneous shelled particles to model the formation of longitudinal and transverse pearl chains observed in dep experiments of mixtures of yeast cells and latex particles the effect of mutual interactions in governing the coupled electrorotation of two dielectric microspheres has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally by simpson et al the effect that pearl chaining of cells has on the dep cross over frequency and how dipole dipole interactions influence electrorotation including the observation of new precession effect has been studied both theoretically and experimentally the effect of the perturbing influence of boundaries has not received as much attention as that given to particle particle interactions polarized particle located near metal or dielectric wall will induce image charges in the wall material to create an attractive force lo and lei employed the theory of images ref pp ref pp to derive dep force and torque expressions for sphere of radius located distance from wall the ratio of the wall perturbing force to the dep force was found to be of the order h h is the length scale of the electric field taken to be the distance between opposing electrodes for dep and electrorotation experiments for m and particle radius of the particle center would need to be more than from boundary for the wall effect to be negligible e less than of the primary dep force or electrorotation torque this condition can readily be satisfied for electrorotation experiments but this is not the case when particles are being attracted to an electrode by positive dep for traveling wave dep is the distance between every second electrode corresponding to one half wavelength when quadrature phase voltages are used and thus equal to the distance of maximum phase difference on the electrode track typical value for is a radius particle would need to be levitated more than above the electrode plane for the wall effect to be negligible levitation heights above are common and so this condition is readily met in traveling wave dep detailed analysis of the factor e is often required for the design of the electrodes in dep device common problem when attempting this arises from the nature of the boundary conditions the applied electric potential is chosen for the surface of metal electrodes the dirichet condition and in the rest of the space to be analyzed the neumann condition is used to specify that the normal derivative of electric potential at boundary surface is zero this can limit the number of simple geometries able to be analyzed accurately numerical methods have been adopted to derive approximate solutions based on green theorem and fourier series however as discussed by green et al these methods can lead to inaccurate results closed form solution with the exact boundary conditions for conventional dep electrodes has been presented by chang et al but is difficult to apply to traveling wave dep for example analytical solutions of the electric potential for planar electrodes that are relevant to both normal dep and traveling wave dep applications have been presented by sun et al song et al recently described new semianalytical approach to the modeling of the dep force generated by planar parallel electrodes as well as those forming three dimensional arrays of the form developed by chen et al the unknown coefficients of the fourier series derived for the electric potential equation were determined by training linear neural network using appropriate data that satisfy both the dirichet and neumann conditions voldman et al developed simulation tools to model the performance of quadrupole dep particle traps this simulation takes as inputs the electric field data and other experimental parameters and computes the total force acting on particle everywhere in space from this it can be determined if the total force on the particle in the trap stably goes to zero at some location such locations are called holding points and represent where the particle will be held in trap by varying the applied flow rate for given experimental condition this modeling environment can determine when the holding points cease to exist and therefore the strength of the dep particle trap schnelle et al conducted comprehensive analysis and experimental investigation of the forces acting on dielectric particles and living cells exposed to alternating and rotating fields generated by multielectrode microsystems this analysis included description of numerical procedures for calculating the electric field distribution and negative dep forces for electrodes of any shape and dielectric particles of complex structure produced by high frequency ac or rotating electric fields up to mhz various multielectrode systems were tested for their ability to move and assemble microparticles or living cells without contact with the electrodes park and beskok provided simple but valuable theoretical model that considers the relative magnitudes of dep electrophoresis ac electro osmosis and brownian motion forces acting on microparticles this theoretical model provides quantitative descriptions of ac electrokinetic transport for given target species and suspending medium conductivity over wide spectrum of electric field amplitude and frequency experimental validations of the model were conducted by park and beskok using interdigitated microelectrodes for polystyrene and gold particles as well as clostridium sporogenes bacterial spores the techniques used for the study and exploitation of dep have advanced considerably since the overview presented by pohl in his seminal text of apart from the term dep now being universally accepted there have been significant advances in electrode design the construction of dep test chambers and with methods to monitor the dep collection of particles at electrodes pohl describes the use of wire electrodes diameter mm energized with applied voltages up to kv in dep experiments to separate various types of particles in mixtures ref pp to quantify dep collection of particles the electrodes were observed through microscope and particle collection often in the form of pearl chain growth was photographed over several minutes ref pp the use of high voltages often resulted in fluid motion arising from thermal effects that perturbed the dep induced motions of the particles this problem has been reduced in dep microfluidic device in which diameter platinum wires in pin plate configuration span the entire depth of the dep chamber and are energized with vpp voltages the fact that the parameter e in eq has units of m provided the clue that by miniaturizing the electrodes dep measurements could be improved in terms of speed and the avoidance of thermal and electrolysis effects using much smaller applied voltages for example by reducing the pertinent scale of the electrode geometry fold the same dep force on particle can be achieved with fold reduction of applied voltage the technology for fabricating microelectrodes already existed in the form of photolithography and metallic vapor deposition g ref the interdigitated castellated geometry shown in fig was chosen because it provides large value for e using modest values of applied voltage the electrode thickness is nm and the characteristic dimension defining the planar geometry typically ranges from to chosen to be times the diameter of the particles to be manipulated by dep as depicted in fig this electrode geometry can be used to simultaneously observe both positive and negative dep of cells across an array of microelectrodes cells experiencing negative dep are elevated above the electrode plane into the fluid medium and this has been exploited in flow through devices for the dep separation and isolation of different cell types in mixtures g ref by aligning the castellations as shown in fig particles elevated into flowing fluid are directed into well defined flow paths this effect has been exploited by yasukawa et al in modified design shown in fig to separate particles according to their size by coupling acoustic waves into an interdigitated microelectrode system particles can first be preconcentrated before focusing them into flow channels and to precise locations using dep forces rajaraman et al describe rapid and low cost microfabrication methods to produce electrode arrays of the interdigitated castellated geometry in the original investigations of the castellated design cells were observed to collect as diamond shaped aggregations on the upper surface of the planar electrodes at frequencies below hz fig with increasing conductivity of the suspending medium the frequency up to which this effect was observed increased to an upper limit of around khz this type of particle aggregation was concluded to not arise from positive dep but possibly to be influenced by electrophoretic effects however green and morgan and ramos et al correctly interpreted this effect in terms of hydrodynamic fluid flow induced by electro osmotic stress arising from the interaction of the electric field and the electrical double layer on an electrode surface anomalous frequency effects not explainable by dep forces alone were also observed by voldman et al for particles held in traps and this was also attributed to electrohydrodynamic flow hoettges et al later designed dep particle trap to exploit such fluid flow effects in so called zipper electrode design dep device architecture that offers interesting possibilities for particle transport without the use of fluid flow is the ratchet geometry described by gonzalez and remcho another electrode design the quadrupole polynomial electrode system shown in fig was chosen to provide defined analytical expressions for the spatial variation of the factor the design of polynomial electrodes is based on the assumption that the electrical potential at any point created by an electrode system of interest is defined by polynomial that obeys laplace equation by substituting this polynomial into laplace equation the corresponding equipotentials can therefore be determined and these in turn can be used to define the electrode boundaries the general design comprises electrodes but the most common one employs namely the quadrupole electrode separations from to as measured between opposing electrodes across the center have been extensively used for both dep and electrorotation experiments the quadrupole design has found wide application for example quadrupole electrode array has been used in device to monitor the dep cross over frequencies fig of oligonucleotide functionalized silica nanoparticles as they participate in dna dna hybridization reactions and kuo and hsieh describe method for performing single bead based biochemical assays on quadrupole dep microfluidic chip voldman et al designed extruded quadrupole electrodes with an asymmetric trapezoidal geometry that are electrically switchable and can be scaled up to form dynamic array cytometer the ability of quadrupole electrodes to form negative dep traps is useful when operating at high values of the fluid medium conductivity for example they have been developed as single cell trapping devices for fluids having conductivities m typical of physiological fluids and culture growth conditions zipper electrode design has been described by hoettges et al in the form of an array of interlocking approximately circular electrode pads as already mentioned this design exploits field induced electrohydrodynamic fluid flow to direct particles toward the electrode pads and then dep forces to trap them this increases the effective capture volume for particles and there is also the advantage that the particles are deposited at the centers of relatively large electrodes and can potentially be detected by surface plasmon resonance or evanescent light scattering general overview of electrodes commonly used for dep studies of cells is given by hoettges methods other than photographic recording through microscope have been developed to measure the dep collection of particles at electrodes this can be achieved by monitoring changes in the optical scattering of light beams through particle suspensions by computerized image analysis of particle motion and by measuring changes of the impedance of the electrodes more recently fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to measure the dep collection of submicron particles an array of zipper dep electrodes has been fabricated onto quartz crystal to provide an extra force to drive particles toward the crystal surface particles loading onto the crystal can be detected very sensitively as shift in resonant frequency of the crystal and this dep aided device was found to perform up to five times faster than other quartz crystal microbalance surface loading techniques described in the literature surface enhanced raman scattering has been used as an on chip detection method in an integrated dep device for the continuous filtering trapping and sorting of bacteria significant development has also been the introduction of new materials and methods for fabricating dep devices early devices g ref consisted of two glass slides held apart by thin gasket with microelectrodes deposited on one or both inner faces sealed together with inlet and outlet fluid ports using epoxy resin the microelectrode fabrication required access to photolithography and metallic vapor deposition facilities in clean room the introduction of the silicone polymer poly dimethylsiloxane pdms has enabled fast and inexpensive fabrication of microfluidic devices by soft lithography under normal benchtop conditions apart from being robust flexible biocompatible and of low thermal conductivity pdms is also ideal for producing devices that require more than one material in fabrication since it can seal to variety of materials devices are easily fabricated by aligning and sealing different layers of pdms containing channels reservoirs valves and electrode bearing substrates valuable protocols for using pdms in the fabrication of microfluidic devices has been provided by friend and yeo reconfigurable microfluidic chip system has been developed by dalton and kaler pdms microchannels are reversibly bonded onto the chip and are readily removed for cleaning changing analytes or to allow different microfluidic channel or electrode geometries to be used using this technique rapid prototyping of both microelectrode designs and microfluidic systems can be performed by most research groups pdms is commercially available as two part self curing material supplied as liquids using photopatternable silicones two levels of metal deposited electrodes can be sandwiched into microchannel layer without an extra etching step being required to make electrical contact between the fluid in the channel and electrodes on the upper and lower layers there is also now the ability to pattern microfluidic networks using dry film resist in either clean room conditions or in basic laboratory environment the resist can be double bonded at relatively low temperatures without the use of extra adhesives and so complex devices can be fabricated with active elements on two substrate layers aspect ratios of more than two can be achieved for free standing structures such as channels and pillars the dry resist is inexpensive fluid sealable biocompatible and can be processed on almost any substrate with any dimension ranging from single chip to complete silicon wafer electron beam lithography and thin film techniques have been used to fabricate vertical microelectrodes with electrode gaps down to made by the superposition of niobium titanium and gold layers the niobium layer improves the mechanical strength and ensures good resistance of the structure to galvanic corrosion excimer laser ablation capable of high resolution patterning over large areas has also been used to fabricate dep devices examples of this are glass based chips combining traveling wave dep and electrorotation to concentrate and assay the viability of microorganisms and structures incorporating dep traveling wave dep and electrorotation for characterizing and selectively trapping cells microorganisms and other particles figure shows traveling wave dep junction fabricated by excimer laser ablation and designed to bring together or separate different particle types combining the complementary techniques of dep traveling wave dep and electrorotation is continuing trend for example dep and traveling wave dep have been combined onto single personal computer pc controlled printed circuit board and tested by manipulating tumor cells all three ac electrokinetic techniques have been incorporated onto single integrated silicon chip mm using conventional microfabrication and tested using human malignant cells to demonstrate the ability to perform as programmable microsystem electrode arrays have also been produced by the excimer laser ablation of indium tin oxide ito electrodes although the optical transparency of an ito film is high making this electrode material particularly suitable for observing dep particle manipulation with transmission microscopy uv radiation such as that used in an excimer laser beam is efficiently absorbed by the ito for it to be micromachined the development of dep technology has always been driven by both curiosity and the search for potential practical applications the separation of target cells from cell mixtures or biofluids for diagnosis drug screening assays therapeutic applications or for further analysis are obvious applications examples of how dep technology has evolved to address such opportunities include the funnel design shown in fig and developed by fiedler et al particles are guided by the angled electrodes to small exit gap at which point particle concentration can be considerably enhanced over the starting concentration introduced into the device angled electrodes are employed in an integrated dep chip design for the continuous filtering and sorting of bioparticles and also used to great effect in continuous dep size based particle sorter and multitarget dep activated cell sorter described by kim et al simple arrangement for aligning cells in fluidic channels consisting of two face to face strip electrodes mounted on the top and bottom of microchannel has been described by schnelle et al in this device particles exhibiting negative dep are brought by fluid flow to an energized electrode pair and as result of experiencing repulsion forces from both electrodes are lifted into the central stream of the fluid flow this basic concept has been refined by demierre et al who fabricated microfluidic device based on an arrangement of lateral metal electrodes and patterned insulator this device combines the concept of insulator based electrodeless dep with multiple frequencies to achieve focusing and continuous separation of dielectric particles flowing through channel the opposition of two dep force fields operating at different frequencies defines position of equilibrium for the dielectric particles placed in these fields the use of curved microchannels for focusing particles into defined flow streams has also been investigated as well as being able to direct particles into specific fluidic streams or ports the selective trapping of them is also important simple method for producing microwell dep traps has been described by fatoyinbo et al and involves drilling holes through laminate consisting of aluminum layers and epoxy layers bocchi et al describe similar method that involves drilling holes through polyimide substrate containing copper gold or aluminum metal layers that form three annular electrodes within the well channel under the device provides the means for fluid flow into the microwells by capillary action an array of traps designed for single particle patterning and capable of holding cells in position against the force produced by practical fluid flow rates has been described by rosenthal and voldman thomas et al describe particle trap consisting of metal ring electrode and surrounding ground plane to create closed electric field cage for particles experiencing negative dep the simplification that each trap requires just one electrical connection allows for the fabrication of large array of single particle trapping centers capable of holding the particles in flowing fluid the operation of the device was demonstrated by trapping single latex spheres and hela cells against moving fluid cells can be maintained on the chip for further culture or released from the chip by fluid flow kang et al describe microfluidic device for separating particles based on hybrid design of pdms insulating hurdle and pair of embedded metal electrodes to generate dep forces dep forces can be used to increase the rate at which particles drift toward sensing element an example of this is described by pham et al who theoretically modeled and fabricated electrodes in the form of pyramidal shaped trenches to enhance the transport of bioparticles such as cells proteins and dna toward reactive surfaces particles experiencing either positive or negative dep can be attracted toward separate collection regions in this pyramidal design iliescu et al describe bidirectional field flow dep separation system comprising glass silicon glass sandwich structure the silicon layer defines the walls of the microfluidic channels and also provides the electrodes in the form of rows of square shaped pillars dep trapping of particles is typically carried out using metal electrodes to provide high field gradients measurements below khz are often limited because of water electrolysis hydrogen and oxygen gas bubbles can appear at the electrode edges and destroy the integrity of the electrodes chou et al avoided this limitation by using constrictions or channels in an insulating material to squeeze the electric field in conducting solution thereby creating high field gradient with local maximum the advantages of this electrodeless form of dep are that no metal evaporation is required during the fabrication process it is mechanically robust and chemically inert and very high fields can be applied without gas evolution due to electrolysis at metal electrodes chou et al demonstrated that this electrodeless form of dep can be used to concentrate and pattern both single strand and double strand dna at far lower frequencies than are feasible with metallic trapping structures this technology brings dep down to the molecular level an exciting development that is already being directed toward rapid dna hybridization assays the ultimate in an electrodeless approach must surely be the use of cusp shaped silica nanocolloids to create localized high field gradient to attract single stranded dna in dna hybridization assay an alternative conventional electrode approach in which some electrodes are energized but others are left electrostatically floating has been presented by golan et al they demonstrate that floating electrodes can produce effective dep forces with the advantage that they do not require connection to an external signal this greatly simplifies the situation where nanoelectrodes are to be used and is envisaged as potential bottom up dep fabrication tool where nanoparticles need to be manipulated with nanometer spatial resolution cummings developed particle filter concentrator that operates without any metal electrodes relatively large low frequency or dc voltage is applied across an array of insulating studs particles flowing through these studs are directed into flow paths according to the relative influences of the electrokinetic and negative dep forces acting on them positive dep has been demonstrated for dna in an optical manipulator using micron sized localized electrodes created by laser illumination of hydrogenated amorphous silicon the concept of four dimensional manipulation using dep forces has been introduced by honegger et al using janus particles janus particles are dissymmetric systems with two faces that could present two different physical chemical properties offering new possibilities in microfluidic research fields in their microfluidic experiment honegger et al demonstrated that not only precise localization of these particles is possible but also that their rotation can be controlled by the gradient of the applied electrical field an impressive achievement was the first demonstration of in vitro dep force microscopy depfm on immobilized cells dep force spectra were obtained in situ in the very short time of ms for red blood cells and acquired over region comparable in dimension to the effective diameter of scanning probe microscopy tip good agreement was observed between the measured dep spectra and predictions using single shell model for the cells in addition to allowing for highly localized dep characterization depfm should be able to provide the means for monitoring localized changes in cell membrane capacitance of cells under aqueous conditions another impressive development has been the integration on disposable silicon chip of dep actuators and optical sensors using complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos technology manaresi et al describe an mm chip containing actuation electrodes arranged in an array of microsites each comprising addressing logic an embedded memory for electrode programming and an optical sensor this design can enable software controlled displacement of more than individual living cells in enclosed fluidic channels by changing under software control the pattern of voltages applied to the electrodes dep field cages can be independently moved around the electrode array any cell or particle trapped in these field cages is detected by the photodiodes located in each microsite cell based biosensor comprising integrated dep electrodes for cell positioning ion sensitive field effect transistors isfets and pseudoreference electrodes has been fabricated using channel metal oxide semiconductor nmos silicon technology the isfets act as ph sensors and were used to monitor the metabolism of bacteria that had been positioned on the active area of the isfet using dep forces general purpose dep system has also been described by liu et al consisting of series of planar microelectrode arrays of different shapes and interelectrode spacings that is suitable for mass production this test bed can be used to investigate the dep properties of wide range of particles as well as being able to assemble devices g zno nanorods as humidity sensor using dep forces at the micro and nanoscale it is evident from fig that the major efforts in dep are now directed toward applications to cover the range of applications in detail would merit review of its own and so only broad overview is presented here mostly in the form of tabulated information good way to appreciate the state of applications of technology is to review the relevant intellectual property this can reveal more details of the technology than appears in the scientific literature as well as the types of companies concerned with its commercial exploitation the first s patent in the field of dep appears to be that granted to hatfield for separating powder mixtures to include liquids as well as solids suspended in liquid whose dielectric capacity lies between that of the constituents of the powder it is understood in this patent that those suspended particles of greater dielectric constant than the liquid will move to the strongest part of an applied electrostatic field while those particles of less dielectric capacity than the liquid will move out of the electrostatic field between the electrodes the rule is that the particles tend to move so as to increase the dielectric capacity of the system this basically is the guiding principle of energetics followed in all subsequent technologies developed to separate or manipulate particles using dep factor mr cm being proportional to the work required to move particle of radius between field and zero field region table provides list of s patents granted in the field of dep from january to may and gives an insight into the range of perceived applications hatfield efforts as embodied in s patent granted june were directed toward separating minerals and it is interesting to find that this objective is again being pursued as for example in the works of lungu batton et al wang et al and ballantyne and holtham apart from mineral separation other industrial applications of dep have been examined ohtsuka and hikita s patent table describe self recovering current limiting fuse the current limiting operation is achieved by switching repeatedly between conducting state brought about by dep collection of conductive particles between two electrodes and an evaporation spreading state of the conductive particles oh and zhou s patent table describe method for depositing patterned coating of nanostructure material onto substrate that includes applying direct and or alternating current electrical field between two electrodes for certain period of time thereby causing the nanostructure materials in the solution to migrate toward and attach themselves to the electrodes edman et al s patent table claim method and apparatus for the fabrication of micron scale and nanoscale devices composed of movable component devices brought together in fluidic medium by forces that include dep along the same lines tupper et al s patent table claim method for the dep collection of micron scale particles granular threadlike sheets or microelectronic parts toward high field regions generated by planar counterelectrode or by dual electrodes such as parallel pins loops or plates all the other patents listed in table are primarily directed toward applications in the biomedical sciences other nonbiological applications include that described by kim et al for polishing local areas of surfaces using abrasive powders such as al diamond or sic dispersed in silicone oil and agitated by dep forces the performance of this method was evaluated using borosilicate glass specimen with atomic force microscopy being used to determine material removal rate and surface quality tests by luo et al on bench scale samples of sandy loam spiked with phenol as model organic pollutant have demonstrated that nonuniform ac electrokinetic processes accelerate the movement and in situ biodegradation of organic pollutants in soil airborne particles significantly contribute to the toxicity of environmental pollution to address this chen and shen present theoretical model to aid the design of dep systems consisting of vertical microchannels to capture airborne particles the ability to dispense and manipulate small fluid droplets ranging from picoliters to nanoliters has many potential applications in lab on chip devices and significant efforts have been directed toward this g refs advances in the technology to enable the dep manipulation of nanoparticles is also opening up new applications including the fabrication of new generation of electronic devices and sensors publications describing the dep manipulation of range of nanoparticles including those addressing the development of new nanoparticle based sensors are listed in table ii by far the most effort in exploring applications of dep has been directed toward addressing unmet needs in the biomedical and biotechnological sciences the range of bioparticles that have been investigated in dep studies is listed in table iii the earliest studies listed were largely directed toward understanding how cells respond to dep forces and to what extent this could lead to better understanding of their physicochemical properties there is now though considerable effort being directed toward applying dep for biomedical and biotechnological applications such as cell sorting tissue engineering and biosensors of importance to the development of point of need devices for detecting and identifying pathogenic microorganisms is the ability to manipulate dna as already noted the electrodeless dep trap shown in fig is capable of trapping dna and this has been used to enhance the preconcentration of single stranded target dna in the vicinity of sensors on which capture probe dna molecules are immobilized within the relatively high ionic strength buffers required for dna hybridization this provides tenfold enhancement of the dna hybridization kinetics at target concentration values down to the sensitivity limit of pm for the sensor platform another approach to developing simple rapid and portable genetic detection method for point of need or field use is the detection of the amplitude and direction of the dep mobility of oligonucleotide functionalized silica nanoparticles as function of dna dna hybridization the sensitivity is at nanomolar concentrations of the target single stranded dna and permits visual detection of the hybridization event without fluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy cheng et al describe novel and potentially important technique they term molecular dep in which cusp shaped silica nanocolloid functionalized with dna probe is used to create localized large field gradient to attract target single stranded dna by dep force and provide picomolar detection and identification within min an integrated dep microfluidic device using planar electrodes that form dep gates has been developed and tested by cheng et al this device which has the potential to perform as multitarget pathogen detection platform can continuously perform the tasks of filtration sorting and trapping of cellular debris and bioparticles with throughput of min in another device common set of inert planar electrodes has been used to position monocytes prior to their electroporation for gene delivery the extent to which electric pulses increased the permeability of the cell membranes to florescent molecules and to dna plasmids was found to depend on prior positioning for given set of electric pulse parameters electroporation was either irreversible resulting in cytolysis reversible leading to gene delivery or not detectable depending on where cells were positioned the results of macqueen et al clearly demonstrated that position dependent electroporation of cells can be controlled by dep procedure that yields rapid sensitive and separation free immunoassay in simple dep device has been described by lee et al an interdigitated microelectrode array is fabricated onto pdms substrate fluorescent microbeads bearing antimouse immunoglobulin igg are suspended in an analyte mouse igg solution where the beads trap the analyte to form immunocomplexes on the beads negative dep is then used to attract the beads to designated areas of the pdms surface precoated with antimouse igg where they are captured via an antibody antigen antibody sandwich reaction these captured beads are detected selectively by fluorescence measurements regardless of the presence of uncaptured beads suspended in the solution for an analyte concentration range of ng ml thus the separation and washing out steps usually required for conventional immunoassay are eliminated in this procedure and the use of dep accelerates this immunoassay to time periods down to kuo and hsieh describe method for performing single bead based consecutive biochemical assays on quadrupole dep microfluidic chip using the interaction of fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc labeled streptavidin with biotin coated polystyrene beads as model system scanning electrochemical microscopy has been used for the analysis of gene expression signals for single cells seeded by positive dep at concentration of cell per well located in array fabricated on an ito electrode applying dep in simple tool for isolating and accurately positioning single cells during cell culture has been investigated optical tweezers have already been developed to achieve such manipulation but dep tweezers could offer advantages in terms of their low cost and simple construction applications would include the ability to pick fewer or rare cells such as primary cells stem cells or fungi and protists from native environments and to pick or position particular and fragile cells for experimental purposes the first reported design of twin electrode dep tweezer for manipulating cells took the form of microring ring electrode assembly formed by the vacuum deposition of platinum and gold films onto the outer and inner surfaces respectively of m diameter capillary tip single myeloma cells could be trapped by positive dep but this was found to result in cell damage arising from electroporation of the cell membrane with later design in the form of dual microdisk comprising two platinum rhodium electrodes of diameter single chlorella cells were captured by positive dep and released by negative dep at new location without harming the cell hunt and westervelt demonstrated that dep tweezer fabricated by vacuum evaporating electrically isolated ti au films onto two sides of sharpened glass rod can trap yeast cells for several hours without harming them the trapped cells were observed to bud and form daughter cells dep tweezer design reported by menachery et al offers advantages in terms of its relatively simple fabrication being capable of construction using facilities available in most electrophysiology laboratories the tweezer was tested using transfected hei human schwannoma cells with visual identification of the target cells being aided by labeling the incorporated gene product with green fluorescent protein as shown in fig cells can be collected into aggregations by both positive and negative dep sebastian et al investigated the shapes that aggregations of mammalian cells form at interdigitated oppositely castellated electrodes under positive dep as function of fluid flow and the value of the ability to engineer artificial cell aggregations offers new investigative tool for cell biologists taking them away from two dimensional cell cultures suspensions of insulinoma beta cells have been directed into aggregates in an array of field cages using micromachined ito electrodes and negative dep some of these beta cell constructs measuring approximately in diameter and in height and containing cells were of the same size and cell density as typical islet of langerhans with the dep force maintained the cell constructs were able to withstand mechanical shock and fluid flow forces the hematon is d aggregate of cells which is able to produce all blood types to be able to do this it must be able to create within the cell aggregate microenvironment which enables hematopoietic stem cell maintenance renewal and differentiation first step has been taken by markx et al toward the creation of artificial hematopoietic stem cell microniches in vitro by the creation with dep of hemispherical cell aggregates these aggregates were of height of having an internal structure similar to that of putative hematon and with the cells in direct contact with each other to potentially allow for direct cell cell communication it was also shown by markx et al that after their dep manipulation the cells remained viable and active yusvana et al demonstrated that dep can be used to create engineered skin with artificial placodes of different sizes and shapes in different spatial patterns the cells in the aggregates remain viable and reorganization and compaction of the cells in the aggregates occur when the artificial skin is subsequently cultured this technique could be of considerable use for the in vitro study of developmental processes where local variations in cell density and direct cell cell contacts are important current techniques in high speed cell sorting are limited by the inherent coupling among three competing parameters of performance throughput purity and rare cell recovery hu et al described dep device that provides an alternate strategy to decouple these parameters through the use of arrayed devices that operate in parallel the dep amplitude response of rare target cells was modulated by labeling cells with particles that differ in polarization response cell mixtures were interrogated in this dep activated cell sorter in continuous flow manner using field frequency to achieve efficient separation between the dep labeled and unlabeled cells to demonstrate the efficiency of this marker specific cell separation hu et al applied this technique to the affinity based enrichment of rare bacteria expressing specific surface marker from an excess of nontarget bacteria that do not express this marker rare target cells were enriched by more than fold in single round of sorting at single channel throughput of cells bessette et al extended this methodology to develop the capability to screen molecular libraries using disposable microfluidic device this provides the potential to simplify and automate reagent generation and to develop integrated bioanalytical systems for clinical diagnostics antibody epitopes were mapped by bessette et al using disposable microfluidic dep device to screen combinatorial peptide library composed of members displayed on bacterial cells on chip library screening was achieved in two stage continuous flow microfluidic sorter that separates antibody binding target cells captured on microspheres through dep funneling electrodes of the form described by schnelle et al and fiedler et al and depicted in fig the antibody fingerprints identified by bessette et al were comparable to those obtained using state of the art commercial cell sorting instrumentation this method has been extended even further with the demonstration of the capability to simultaneously enrich multiple distinct target cells into independent fractions this multitarget dep activated cell sorter operates two input multiple output device in continuous flow manner the input consists of running buffer and sample mixture containing multiple types of target cells each labeled with distinct dep tag after single pass through the device the target and nontarget cells are separated and eluted through multiple independent spatially segregated outlets continuous high throughput bioparticle sorter based on traveling wave dep has been designed and tested on various heterogeneous samples red blood cells plus cell debris or bacteria polydispersed liposomes by cheng et al table iv summarizes the performance reported for various dep cell sorters an important parameter is not included namely the purity or enrichment achieved for the recovered cell fractions this is sometimes reported but not always and generally it can be taken that compromise exists between the sorting rate and the purity or enrichment achieved all of the dep devices listed in table iv apart from the immuno dep device of kim et al did not involve the labeling or engineered tagging of the cells kim et al employed synthetic particles as tags that were larger than the cells method also adopted in the immunomagnetic method the work of markx et al in creating artificial stem cell microniches is an example of how dep can be used as tool to address an unmet need in stem cell research and therapy stem cells are immature cells characterized by varying capacity for growth and the ability to differentiate into one or more different derivatives with specialized function these capacities can vary depending on the in vivo origin of the stem cell populations the in vitro environment and the manipulation to which they are subjected methods to monitor characterize and manipulate stem cells should ideally be relatable to individual cells which might be sampled to represent larger populations and non or minimally invasive so as not to alter the behavior of the cells currently the most common methods used to quantitatively characterize or positively negatively select or purify cell populations for research or translational applications include flow cytometry fluorescence activated cell sorting facs or magnetic bead coupled cell separation these methods are dependent on the existence of specific cell surface antigens and the formulation availability of high affinity probes to these antigens irreversible attachment of these probes to target cells also has the potential to influence cell behavior in the absence of specific or unique marker or to avoid potentially confounding interactions of probes with cells alternative methods are required to identify and manipulate target stem cells in heterogeneous cell populations dep operates on the intrinsic dielectric properties of cells and so is potentially capable of sorting cells without the need for engineered labels or tags the number of reported dep experiments on stem cells is small the first studies demonstrated that dep could be used to enrich hematopoietic stem cells defined as those expressing the cd antigen from mixed cell population in bone marrow and peripheral blood without the requirement for any cell manipulation such as antibody binding the different cell fractions exhibited spread of dep characteristics suggesting some form of heterogeneity within the cd cell population the separated cells were viable and data from colony forming assays correlated well with the percentage of cd cells in each collected cell fraction in more recent work dep has been used to obtain populations enriched for putative adult stem cells as defined by expression of the stromal marker ng from enzyme digested adipose tissue of particular interest is the work of flanagan et al whose objective was to determine whether stem cells and their more differentiated progeny can be identified by means other than flow cytometry mouse neural stem precursor cells nspcs and their differentiated derivatives neurons and glia were found to have distinct differences in their positive dep behavior moreover the dep signatures were found to distinguish nspcs from different developmental ages in fashion that predicted their respective fate biases this suggests that the developmental progression of progenitor cell populations can be revealed by the cells dielectric properties these results also highlight the fact that stem cell differentiation is gradual process and that cells may begin to develop some characteristics of their more differentiated progeny before known cell surface markers can be detected and well before the cells become fully differentiated values for the dep cross over frequency fxo see fig can be extrapolated from the data shown by flanagan et al however cell size was not determined or at least reported and so we are unable to relate the observed dep differences for the various differentiated states of the neural stem cells in terms of cell membrane capacitance this would have provided an insight into possible differences in the intrinsic surface properties of the cells cell cytoplasmic membrane acts as capacitor because it is constructed like one namely thin dielectric situated between two conductors the outer and inner electrolytes for cell of radius suspended in an electrolyte of conductivity the membrane capacitance ccm can be determined from measurement of the dep cross over frequency fxo using the following relationship ccm rfx this equation assumes that the high resistance value of the cell membrane has not been impaired due to damage or the onset of cell death for example for fixed cell radius the effective membrane capacitance of smooth cell will be less than that for cell having complex cell surface topography associated with the presence of microvilli blebs membrane folds or ruffles for example this will influence the value observed for fxo which has important implications for applying dep to characterize and selectively isolate target cells from other cells the basic theory describing the dep behavior of particles is now well established and has brought the user friendly effective dipole moment method to the stage where it leads to results that match those produced using the more rigorous but not so user friendly maxwell stress tensor method g ref areas that could benefit from more attention include perturbing effects associated with particles interacting with physical boundaries g chamber walls and other particles understanding the influence that the electrical double layer surrounding nanoparticle has on its dep behavior is an ongoing pursuit g refs and the technology has reached an exciting stage as for example the use of cmos the development of scanning force dep and the assembly of nanoparticles composed of two or more physicochemically differing surfaces e janus particles as described by lumsdon et al large steps have been made toward translating the theoretical treatment of both biological and nonbiological nanoparticles to practical applications g biosensors bioassays also dep initially used to characterize the dielectric properties of cells and other bioparticles is now at the stage of developing into tool to address very important unmet needs in stem cell research and therapy it may be fitting to conclude by quoting the final paragraph written by an unknown author on the dust cover of pohl book of far wider range of potential applications exists than professor pohl has been able to include the book should thus provide stimulating reading for imaginative research workers in the physical medical and biological sciences  ambipolar organic semiconductors enable complementary like circuits in organic electronics here we show promising electron and hole transport properties in the natural pigment tyrian purple dibromoindigo ray diffraction of tyrian purple films reveals highly ordered structure with single preferential orientation attributed to intermolecular hydrogen bonding this material with band gap of ev demonstrates high hole and electron mobilities of cm s and cm s in transistors respectively and air stable operation inverters with gains of in the first and third quadrant show the large potential of tyrian purple for the development of integrated organic electronic circuits complementary circuits cmos originally developed in silicon microelectronics are the basis technology for integrated circuits due to the wide noise margin durability and low power dissipation achievable in organic electronics the fabrication of cmos like circuits with discrete and channel devices from the same semiconductor remains challenging organic ambipolar semiconductors should have small band gap supporting injection of electrons and holes from single electrode material here we show that the natural pigment tyrian purple dibromoindigo figure is an ambipolar organic semiconductor with large electron and hole mobilities tyrian purple forms highly ordered films with single preferential orientation when prepared by evaporation we have used such films to fabricate ambipolar organic field effect transistors and inverters with high gain in the first and third quadrants these devices exemplify the possibility of fabrication of high performance biocompatible and biodegradable organic electronics one of the most prized dyes in antiquity tyrian purple was originally produced from sea snails we prepared the dye synthetically via published procedures and purified it twice by temperature gradient sublimation transistors were fabricated on glass substrates by first creating an alox dielectric layer electrochemically nm on vacuum evaporated aluminum gate electrode nm next nm passivation layer of the oligoethylene tetratetracontane h ttc was evaporated onto the alox easily extracted from petroleum distillation ttc is biodegradable and occurs abundantly in nature being identified in large amounts up to in medicinal plants ttc passivated alox slides were annealed at oc for under nitrogen giving specific capacitance d of nf cm next nm of tyrian purple was evaporated from hot wall epitaxial source at rate of gold source and drain electrodes were evaporated through shadow mask giving l of mm similar to indigo ray diffraction xrd of tyrian purple deposited on ttc showed only one diffraction peak figure instead of debye ring characteristic of polycrystalline materials suggesting crystalline texture with single preferential orientation this high long range order is also reflected in large relative permittivity from impedance measurements of al dye al structures we calculated value of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygens and amine hydrogen has been intensively characterized through ray diffraction and other studies of indigoids each tyrian purple molecule is nearly perfectly planar with deviation from planarity of and is hydrogen bonded to four others with an interplanar distance between two parallel molecules of since the molecule alone has low level of conjugation two phenyl rings separated by an unconjugated bridge we surmise that its highly ordered growth resulting in intermolecular stacking is integral for charge transport cyclic voltammetry and uv vis measurements of tyrian purple thin films are shown in figures and respectively on the basis of these we estimate band gap of ev homo level of ev and lumo level of ev atomic force microscopy afm measurements of tyrian purple show the formation of crystalline needle like grains with sizes in the nm range with the channel length used in these transistors and grains of this size it is likely that overall mobility is limited by intergrain mobility an afm image of nm of tyrian purple grown on ttc is shown in figure transfer and output characteristics of transistor devices are shown in figure c in the first quadrant the output characteristics of tyrian purple show superlinear increase of current at low applied gate voltages due to the injection of electrons in channel dominated by holes similarly in the third quadrant the superlinear regime occurs for decreasingly negative gate voltages because of the injection of holes the electron and hole field effect mobilities are calculated in the saturation regime according to reported methods as shown in figure the field effect mobilities are typically around cm vs for holes and cm vs for electrons with positive source drain voltage threshold gate voltages for holes are in the range while for electrons v on off ratios were for both channels leakage current igs as shown in figure was in the picoamp range we found that both hole and electron mobilities show little deterioration during measurement in air even after repeated cycles figure this is due to the relatively deep lumo value of approx ev quasi static transfer curves and corresponding voltage gains of complementary like inverter circuits are shown at various vdd voltages in figures d gains of in the first and in the third quadrants are among the highest reported to date for organic ambipolar devices these devices showed little hysteresis upon cycling in summary we have found promising ambipolar transistor operation with the natural material tyrian purple the performance of this material is compared with data on previously reported ambipolar organic semiconductors in table mobilities in tyrian purple are on par with values reported in recent studies the crystalline texture with single preferential orientation as evidenced by single xrd peak and high dielectric constant are interesting properties of this hydrogen bonded semiconducting material we fabricated devices featuring high mobilities and high voltage gains in complementary like voltage inverters we achieve low voltage operation utilizing gate dielectric of alox passivated with naturally occuring oligoethylene tetratetracontane this work demonstrates that high performance organic electronics can be fabricated from biomaterials  water interaction with quasi freestanding graphene deposited on pt has been investigated by using vibrational spectroscopy loss measurements show that water molecules dosed at room temperature can dissociate giving rise to h bonds the formation of the h bonds strongly attenuates the optical phonons of the graphene sheet on the other hand at water has been found to adsorb only in molecular state present findings should be taken into account in engineering graphene based devices which should work at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature the unusual properties of graphene are attracting great attention as it represents promising material for potential applications in electronics and photonics the chemical modification of graphene is fundamental for tailoring its physical and chemical properties in particular the interaction of water with graphene is receiving much interest water molecules adsorbed on graphene act as dopants without remarkable changes in electron mobility however recently it has been reported that water adsorption could change photoemission spectra of air exposed graphene samples moreover tunable band gap of about ev can be opened by controlled adsorption of water molecules the hydrolysis products could be used for functionalizing graphene in order to create graphene field effect transistors however detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms ruling o interaction with graphene is hitherto missing in fact the adsorption of water on surfaces involves complex combination of electrostatic van der waals and hydrogen bonding interactions herein we report on high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy hreels measurements on water adsorption on quasi freestanding monolayer graphene mlg grown on pt hreel experiments indicate that water molecules dosed at room temperature onto the graphene sheet can dissociate giving rise to h vibrational bands the presence of the h bonds strongly attenuates the optical phonons of mlg on the other hand only vibrations of molecular water are present in the hreel spectrum recorded at experiments were carried out in an ultra high vacuum uhv chamber which is divided into main chamber and preparation chamber respectively separated by gate valve the sample was single crystal of pt the substrate was cleaned by repeated cycles of ion sputtering and annealing at surface cleanliness and order were checked using auger electron spectroscopy aes and low energy electron diffraction leed measurements respectively mlg has been obtained by dosing ethylene onto the clean pt substrate at thus the graphene sheet is intrinsically thermally stable up to such preparation temperature as shown in ref as demonstrated by in situ low energy electron microscopy no nucleation and growth of additional graphene sheets beyond the monolayer is possible on pt the attained leed pattern shown in figure is essentially similar to that one reported in ref the ring pattern indicates the existence of different domains nonetheless preferred orientations aligned with the substrate are clearly distinguished despite the presence of other domains the predominance of in the whole sample has been clearly inferred by the analysis of phonon dispersion measurements performed along the bar gamma bar k and the bar gamma bar m directions the presence of well resolved spots in the leed pattern is clear fingerprint of the order of the mlg over structure also evidenced by the high electron reflectivity of the attained surface even higher with respect to the bare pt substrate furthermore the characterization of the mlg was carried out by measuring lattice vibrations which are fingerprint of graphene formation as shown in figure the presence of well resolved za out of plane acoustic zo out of plane optical la longitudinal acoustic lo longitudinal optical and to transverse optical phonons ensures of the good order and crystalline quality of the graphene sheet the energy resolution of the hreel spectrometer was degraded to mev so as to increase the signal to noise ratio of loss peaks the incidence angle has been set to with respect to the sample normal the analysis of both leed pattern and phonon modes show in agreement with previous results negligible interaction between mlg and the underlying pt substrate accordingly mlg may be considered as quasi freestanding sheet on pt figure shows that the hreel spectrum attained after exposing the pristine mlg spectrum to l mbar of water molecules at room temperature spectrum in the preparation chamber vibrational bands centered at and mev were recorded interestingly the latter two peaks indicate the occurrence of water dissociation as they are well known to be unambiguous fingerprint of the formation of h bonds they are assigned to the bending and stretching vibrations of h respectively more in details the energy of the h stretching indicates the formation of sp bond in fact such mode is expected around and mev for the sp and sp hybridization respectively the absence of vibrational modes of oh groups at mev indicates that their adsorption energy is positive in the presence of co adsorbed atoms on the mlg sheet e such species are not stable at the intensity of vibrational features significantly increased in off specular scattering geometry spectrum of the same figure this is consequence of the weak oscillating dipole of chemisorbed atoms against the graphene sheet the low energy of the impinging electron beam ep e ev ensures of the absence of electron beam induced effects as matter of fact dissociation of adsorbed water molecules on graphene by electron irradiation in ref has been attained only for very high primary beam energies ep ev for the sake of completeness it is worth mentioning that losses at mev in spectrum and mev in spectrum of figure could be assigned to phonon modes of the single side hydrogenated surface such lattice vibrations strongly disperse as function of the scattering angle that is the parallel momentum transfer see ref for more details on their dispersion relation from the intensity of h stretch in hreel spectra we can estimate the coverage to be ml due to the high dissociation barrier for water molecules we are led to suggest that water dissociation should occur on defects of the graphene lattice as for most other materials defects are unavoidable during the preparation of graphene obviously defects exist even in the presence of well resolved and sharp phonons figure which indicate very good crystalline quality essential for preserving the unusual and peculiar properties of graphene likewise it has been demonstrated that water can dissociate at vacancy defects on graphite following many possible reaction pathways some of which have activation barriers lower than half the value for the dissociation of bulk water however we could not exclude that the dissociation could be driven by the catalytic activity of the underlying pt substrate as an example the role of the substrate on water adsorption on graphene has been put in evidence in ref moreover strong effects from the growth method itself are possible water reactivity strongly depends on both the substrate underneath the graphene sheet as well as the amount and type of defects we want to point out that our experiments have been performed with particular type of graphene quasi freestanding epitaxial mlg and under specific conditions thus further experimental efforts are needed in order to establish whether results presented herein could be extended to all kinds of graphene samples adsorbates desorb from mlg upon annealing at as evidenced by the lack of vibrational modes in the annealed surface spectrum of figure in figure we show the effects of o exposure on the optical phonon modes of mlg the pristine graphene middle spectrum is characterized by the presence of out of plane zo and longitudinal lo optical phonons at and mev respectively after water adsorption and dissociation the intensity of these modes strongly decreased topmost spectrum of figure the band at mev is due to the h stretching mode it is worthwhile mentioning that photoemission spectroscopy pes experiments on an air exposed mlg au ni sample reported strong reduction of the intensity from the graphene bands the intensity decrease was tentatively assigned to adsorbate water from the atmosphere with the aim of investigating the possible occurrence of water dissociation at lower sample temperature the initial stages of water adsorption on graphene were probed we found that at water is adsorbed molecularly without trace of any dissociation bottom spectrum of figure in fact the hreel spectrum shows clear fingerprint of molecular water figure in particular vibrational bands may be divided into four major categories see ref for review frustrated translations at mev frustrated rotations e librations at mev o deformations e the scissoring band centered around mev and h stretching modes around mev the desorption of molecular water occurs at without evidence of any water dissociation topmost spectrum of figure in summary we have shown that water exposure at room temperature of mlg pt could lead to the formation of h bonds such finding gives response to previous results of ref dehydrogenation is possible upon annealing at on the other hand no dissociation was observed at due to its peculiar properties graphene represents promising candidate for potential technological applications sensors plasmonic devices protecting coatings energy storage thz electronics etc with this in mind we want to point out that water induced hydrogenation of graphene should be taken into account in engineering graphene based devices which should work at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature water dissociation could also afford interesting pathways to produce hydrogen  we review the theory fabrication and implementation of the josephson bifurcation amplifier jba at the core of the jba is nonlinear oscillator based on reactively shunted josephson junction weak input signal to the amplifier couples to the junction critical current and results in dispersive shift in the resonator plasma frequency this shift is enhanced by biasing the junction with sufficiently strong microwave current irf to access the nonlinear regime where varies with irf for drive frequency such that d the oscillator enters the bistable regime where two nondissipative dynamical states ol and oh which differ in amplitude and phase can exist the sharp dependent transition from ol to oh forms the basis for sensitive digital threshold amplifier in the vicinity of the bistable regime analog amplification of continuous signals is also possible we present experimental data characterizing amplifier performance and discuss two specific applications the readout of superconducting qubits digital mode and dispersive microwave magnetometry analog mode electrical amplifiers are ubiquitous in experimental physics they raise the energy of signal coming from measurement to level sufficient to exceed the noise of the recording and processing electronics amplifiers are based on nonlinear elements such as the transistor for instance typically such components are dissipative and exhibit change in their dynamic two terminal resistance in response to an input signal applied to third terminal such as gate the superconducting tunnel junction is unique two terminal device that can be operated as either nonlinear resistor or inductor number of different circuit elements such as superconducting island or loop can serve as the third input terminal to couple an external signal such as an electric charge or magnetic flux respectively to the properties of the junction in particular the critical current small variations in can significantly change the transport properties of the junction under appropriate bias conditions giving rise to sensitive amplifier with near quantum limited noise performance let us review the basic properties of josephson tunnel junctions josephson tunnel junction is formed by separating two superconducting electrodes with barrier such as thin oxide layer the current t and voltage t of the junction can be expressed in terms of the gauge invariant phase difference as t sin and t dt where the parameter is the junction critical current and is the reduced flux quantum these equations parameterize nonlinear inductor with inductance lj cos which for or equivalently t reduces to lj this inductance is by construction shunted in parallel by the geometric capacitance cj of the junction thereby forming an electrical oscillator the dynamics of this oscillator can be described by the motion of phase particle with coordinate in an anharmonic sinusoidal potential i cos the natural frequency of small oscillations in this potential the plasma frequency is lj cj in general due to the nonlinear nature of the josephson inductance the natural frequency of the oscillator will be function of the oscillation amplitude in josephson amplifier an external signal typically modulates the critical current of the junction changing both the height of the sinusoidal potential and the plasma frequency two measurement protocols to detect variations in are illustrated in fig in the dissipative approach the height of the potential barrier i idc is determined by biasing the junction with current idc and detecting the onset of finite resistance in this scheme the phase particle has sufficient energy to escape the potential well and the phase difference advances linearly in time generating finite dc voltage switching to the finite voltage state of the junction can be avoided by using dispersive measurement technique to determine i irf as shown in fig this involves applying an alternating current irf sin dt and measuring the time varying voltage across the junction at the drive frequency if irf the junction remains in the superconducting state and the phase particle oscillates in only one well of the sinusoidal potential with no dc voltage generated however the amplitude and phase of the oscillating junction voltage t vj cos dt vary with i irf the josephson bifurcation amplifier jba is dispersive detector that exploits the anharmonicity of the junction oscillator for enhanced measurement sensitivity in this oscillator the plasma frequency i irf varies not only with the critical current but also with the drive amplitude irf when biased with sufficiently strong current irf the plasma frequency shift for small modulation in is significantly increased as compared to the case with lower drive current when the oscillator is in the linear regime the dependence of the plasma frequency on drive amplitude is depicted in fig where the steady state amplitude vj and the phase of the junction voltage are plotted as function of and irf see sec ii for theory the resonant response sharpens and shifts to lower frequency as the drive amplitude is increased at higher drive powers the system bifurcates from single valued to bistable regime when the drive frequency solid vertical line is sufficiently detuned from the small oscillation plasma frequency the system can have two possible oscillation states ol and oh which differ in amplitude and phase the dashed lines on the response curves indicate unstable solutions for bias point such as the one indicated by the black dot in the figure small decrease in will cause the oscillator to evolve from ol to oh thus realizing sensitive threshold detector for the smallest variation in that can be resolved is limited by thermal or quantum fluctuations which broaden this transition in this digital mode of operation small changes in the critical current translate into changes in the occupation probability of the two dynamical states the circuit schematic of the jba is shown in fig the tunnel junction is shunted in parallel by an additional purely reactive impedance which in the simplest case is capacitor with cs cj this reactive impedance allows one to tune the resonant frequency and the quality factor of the resonator the junction can also be embedded in transmission line cavity to form nonlinear transmission line resonator we will consider the capacitively shunted case in detail in this review though brief description of the transmission line version will be provided in sec ii the input signal couples to the junction examples of input circuits used to couple weak electrical signals are shown in the inset in an external signal is inductively coupled to superconducting quantum interference device squid loop which modulates in a superconducting single electron transistor set is used to couple signals capacitively microwave generator with output impedance drives current irf sin dt via the circulator which allows microwave signals to flow in one direction the signal reflected from the resonator is the amplifier output and is coupled to cryogenic semiconductor amplifier through the adjacent port of the circulator this signal is further amplified and demodulated at room temperature using quadrature mixers to determine the signal amplitude and phase the idea of amplifying signals using bifurcation is quite common and observed in electrical optical chemical and biological systems see ref and references therein recently such nonlinear behavior has been observed in nanomechanical resonators and is being extensively studied for applications in parametric sensing biological example of bifurcation amplification in nature is the human ear the cochlea in our ear is biased close to hopf bifurcation which leads to several remarkable properties in our hearing such as compression of dynamic range infinitely sharp tuning at zero input and generation of combination tones the ear is essentially nonlinear amplifier e the response depends quite strongly on the strength of the input signal researchers in robotics and medical sciences are currently in the process of constructing hearing sensor which can mimic the nonlinear properties of the cochlea in superconducting devices the josephson parametric amplifier also exploits proximity to bifurcation these devices are capable of achieving large gain with near quantum limited noise and can show quantum effects such as squeezing of noise below the standard quantum limit note that the jba can also be operated as conventional parametric amplifier by combining weak input signal along with the drive signal when biased in the vicinity of the bifurcation points the system can exhibit parametric gain like in recently developed amplifiers based on multi junction rather than single junction circuits embedded in microwave cavities in this review we will detail the theory of operation of the jba in sec ii focusing in particular on the case where the shunting impedance is simple capacitor in sec iii we discuss device design and fabrication the cryogenic measurement setup is detailed in sec iv in sec measurements characterizing the stand alone amplifier are presented in sec vi we discuss two particular applications of the jba measurements of the quantronium qubit and high speed magnetometry we present concluding remarks in sec vii we study bifurcation amplification in two types of circuits the first one is lumped element resonator where we shunt the josephson junction with capacitor to form the nonlinear resonator this circuit is shown in fig here is the critical current of the junction cj is the intrinsic junction capacitance cs cj is the shunt capacitance to tune the resonant frequency and is the real part of the current source impedance which provides damping in the second technique we embed josephson junction in half wave transmission line resonator as shown in fig if we make single mode approximation for the transmission line resonator near its resonant frequency one arrives at the equivalent lcr circuit shown in fig the values of the effective circuit elements are given by the following equationsveff cinvd reff r cout leff ceff where is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line cin cout are the input and output coupling capacitors is the bare resonant frequency of the cavity set by its length and speed of microwaves in the transmission line and as before is the characteristic impedance of the microwave feed lines the transmission line version which has been dubbed the cavity bifurcation amplifier cba essentially works on the same principle as the lumped element jba though it offers some practical advantages such as ease of fabrication absence of dielectric layers possibility of multiplexing etc in this section we will begin by establishing the connection between the jba and the cba but we will restrict the detailed description to that of the jba for more details on the cba see ref the classical differential equations describing the dynamics of josephson junction oscillator driven with rf current for the circuits depicted in figs and are given below cs t dt rd dt sin irf cos dt in leff q d t dt reffdq dt qceff vrf cos dt vn in eq is the gauge invariant phase difference across the junction is the drive frequency and is the reduced flux quantum the noise current in models the thermal noise of the source impedance in eq is the charge on the capacitor ceff and vn is the effective thermal noise of the impedance reff under appropriate driving conditions this nonlinear oscillator can have two steady driven states differing in amplitude and phase even though eqs and look different especially with respect to the location of the nonlinear term they reduce to the same effective equation if we assume harmonic solutions for or t at the drive frequency of the form t ei dt c we can show that the equation of motion for the dimensionless slowly varying complex amplitude corresponding to eqs and can be reduced todud iu i fn where d is the reduced drive detuning is the resonant frequency for small oscillations is the quality factor d is the dimensionless slow time is the reduced drive power and fn is the reduced noise term equation has been derived under the rotating wave approximation with only leading order nonlinear terms being retained in eqs and the expressions for q and for the jba and the cba are given in table where leffi so apart from different expressions for the reduced variables in the terms of circuit parameters the nonlinear dynamics of jba and cba oscillators converges to the universal form eq for large hence from now on we will restrict our discussion to the jba the scaled steady state solutions of eq du for the jba are plotted in fig for different excitation amplitude irf these curves are computed with the noise term fn set to zero the different curves correspond to different drive strength for irf the response is linear with characteristic lorentzian line shape in this regime the phase particle only samples small values of so that the sinusoidal potential is well approximated by parabola which describes harmonic behavior for increasing drive amplitude the higher order nonlinear terms contribute and reduce the plasma frequency i irf but the response is still single valued for sufficiently strong drive the oscillator bifurcates and can occupy one of two metastable states ol and oh these states differ significantly in oscillation amplitude and phase the dashed lines in fig indicate the unstable solutions to illustrate how small variation in critical current can be detected the phase response of the oscillator for two different values of is plotted in fig for three different drive currents corresponding to the linear response regime the single valued nonlinear regime and the bifurcation regime described above an input signal modulates the critical current and shifts the plasma frequency shown in fig as displacement of the response curves to operate the jba drive current at fixed frequency is applied an alternative technique where the drive amplitude is kept fixed but the frequency is swept has been recently presented in ref shift in is detected as shift in phase of the reflected signal output as described in fig in the linear regime shown in fig the maximum phase shift and thus the maximum gain are achieved by driving the oscillator at p as indicated by the solid line sensitivity can be improved by increasing the quality factor rcs of the oscillator but at the direct cost of reducing the amplifier bandwidth another approach to improve sensitivity which is at the heart of the jba is to increase the drive current to access the nonlinear regimes shown in figs and in fig the phase response is sharper on the lower frequency part of the response curve and greater sensitivity can be obtained by driving at frequency red detuned from as indicated by the dashed line for yet stronger drives the response curve transitions sharply between the two branches as shown in fig if the drive frequency is chosen in the vicinity of this bifurcation point then the oscillator will occupy one oscillation state or the other depending on the value of by adjusting the drive current amplitude and frequency the phase difference in the reflected signal between these states can approach realizing very sensitive threshold detector for small variations in which does not rely on switching to the dissipative finite voltage state in the linear and the single valued nonlinear regime the minimum critical current variation that can be resolved and thus the ultimate sensitivity of the amplifier depend on the smallest phase or amplitude shift analog quantities that can be resolved by the cryogenic microwave measurement electronics in given time interval in the bifurcation regime the reflected signal phase is digital quantity with sufficiently large difference between the two oscillation states that it can be fully resolved within practical integration times ns the amplifier sensitivity in the bifurcation regime is thus set by the minimal critical current variation which causes the oscillator to switch from one dynamical state to the other this is determined by the dominant fluctuations thermal or quantum in the system sensitivity is thus not limited by microwave electronics an important practical advantage for given drive frequency such that rcs d the systems exhibits bistability within certain range of drive amplitude such that ib irf ib here ib and ib are called the lower and upper bifurcation currents respectively figure shows plot of the steady state solutions of eq as function of reduced drive power for different values of reduced drive detuning multivalued solutions exist only for the bifurcation points are the turning points of these curves where the slope u the reduced bifurcation points are indicated ib for the curve with the saddle node bifurcation is found in the vicinity of the upper bifurcation current ib which is given byib q where p is the dimensionless detuning of the drive the above formula has been computed by retaining only one nonlinear term in the expansion of sin using the method outlined in ref and is given here in the limit of high quality factor such that the jba when operated as digital threshold detector is biased near this point by ramping the current hence in what follows whenever we mention bifurcation point current we mean the upper bifurcation point current there are two important quantities that go into determining the sensitivity of the jba to changes in critical current when operated as digital threshold detector the first quantity is the shift in the bifurcation current ib with critical current this quantity can be written as follows ib ib we can infer from the above equation that the fractional variation in the bifurcation current ib ib is always larger than the fractional variation in critical current i since the second quantity that determines the sensitivity of the jba is the intensity of fluctuations at given temperature these fluctuations induce switching between the metastable states of the jba which gives finite width to the transition from the low ol to the high oh amplitude state in the classical regime kbt this dynamical switching can be described by an arrhenius law in which the rate of escape from an effective cubic metapotential escrf exp uescrf kbt is written as the product of an attempt frequency and boltzmann factor which contains the barrier height uescrf and the system temperature in this case the effective barrier height is uescrf uescrf irf ib uescrf where the coefficient uescrf is given to lowest order in similarly the attempt frequency in the metapotential is given by a irf ib q where we have assumed that the jba is biased sufficiently close to the bifurcation point resulting in an overdamped motion in the rotating frame we should point out that for bias points sufficiently far from the bifurcation point the motion in the rotating frame is underdamped and eq has different power law but eq remains valid we now introduce the idea of switching probability curve or an curve if the jba is biased by ramping the current irf to value slightly lower than ib there is finite probability that it will make transition from the low amplitude state to the high amplitude state in given time tw this is called the switching probability pswitch at that bias point since we know the escape rate escrf from the low amplitude state to the high amplitude state of the jba we can define the probability of switching in given time tw pswitch irf tw exp tw escrf irf where pswitch irf has been defined as function of two parameters the drive amplitude irf and the critical current as we are interested in the variation in pswitch with respect to these two parameters the curve is essentially the plot of pswitch versus irf for given and varies smoothly from zero to one fig the finite width of this curve is set by the intensity of fluctuations and hence the temperature clearly change in the value of critical current will shift the curve resulting in change in pswitch this is the principle of detection in the digital mode the switching probability is measured by sending many pulses to the jba and recording the resulting oscillation state of the jba for each pulse the shift in curves is essentially related to the shift in the bifurcation current and can be inferred from eq ishift ib i ib i the computation of the curve width is subtle since eq and hence eq is only valid for small escape rates uescrf kbt it essentially breaks down near the top of the curve where the switching rates are very high so we compute the width of the curve in terms of the drive amplitude using different procedure the upper boundary of the curve is clearly set by ib since the escape barrier vanishes at the bifurcation point for the lower boundary we use the point when uescrf kbt since pswitch starts becoming nonzero around that point the resulting width is given by iwidth ib kbtuescrf where uescrf is given by eq note that this definition of iwidth is not strictly identical to that depicted in fig where we qualitatively illustrate the idea of the width of an curve we get unit change in pswitch when the shift in the curve is about the same as its width combining the above two equations we can compute the change in critical current that can be resolved in single pulsed measurement or the critical current resolution as i kbt we note that the critical current resolution depends quite weakly on most parameters the strongest being the temperature the dependence on is quite weak which means that there is flexibility in choosing the value of junction critical current if the total time taken for one pulsed measurement is tpulse set by and noise temperature of the microwave amplification chain then we can express the critical current resolution in terms of critical current sensitivity per unit bandwidth assi kbt tpulse an important point to be noted is that the above analysis has been done in the limit of large and small escape rates escrf in order to simplify calculations and see trends clearly often many of these approximations become too crude in real experiments especially for small and the only way to obtain accurate predictions is with full numerical simulations of eq nevertheless the above formulae serve as guide to the phenomena and provide quick estimates for more details on the calculation see ref furthermore we have neglected intrinsic fluctuations in the junction critical current as these have well studied intensity and frequency spectrum which diminishes their contribution at microwave frequencies in the quantum regime kbt the above analysis remains valid if we replace with an effective temperature teff kb this result has been predicted theoretically using the idea of quasienergies in the rotating frame for both underdamped and overdamped motion in the rotating frame note that this effective temperature is different from the saturation temperature seen in the escape to the voltage state in dc current biased junction d kb which is determined by tunneling rate at low temperatures one can also arrive at these results by treating the jba as parametric amplifier when biased near the bifurcation point the parametric amplification process converts the virtual zero point quantum fluctuations into real classical fluctuations the effective temperature of this classical bath tends to teff kb as the bath temperature for operating points close to the bifurcation point one can compute the full expression for the effective temperature asteff kbcoth kbt and we note that this expression tends to the correct limits as this expression is identical to the one obtained in ref if we ignore effects of dephasing due to oscillator frequency modulation this is justified since the only source of dephasing in jba circuits would be due to fluctuations in the critical current of the junction or the dielectric constant of the capacitor and they are quite small in the frequency range relevant for escape dynamics in this section we will briefly discuss the techniques for fabricating the jba and some design considerations in the first step metallic underlayer either normal metal au or cu or superconductor nb is deposited on silicon substrate to form one plate of the shunting capacitor this is followed by deposition of nm insulating sin layer by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition at this layer is the dielectric material in the capacitor using beam lithography and double angle shadow mask evaporation we then fabricate the top capacitor plates along with few square micron sized al alox al tunnel junction the top capacitor plates along with the metallic underlayer form two capacitors in series figure shows an optical image of the on chip capacitor along with the schematic profile of the ground plane multilayer used for cu based capacitors the other metallic layers ti and cr were employed for protecting the cu layer during the deposition of the dielectric layer it also ensured that the cu layer would adhere properly to the silicon substrate for au and nb underlayers sin was directly deposited on top also shown in the bottom right corner is scanning electron microscrope sem image of typical josephson tunnel junction the critical current of the junction was in the range of a corresponding to josephson inductance in the range of lj nh by varying both the dielectric layer thickness and the pad area the total shunt capacitance cs was varied between and pf the plasma frequency of the jba was kept in the range of ghz several samples were fabricated and their parameters are listed in table ii for more details on fabrication techniques including the transmission line version of the jba see ref we will now discuss some important design considerations to ensure that well controlled bifurcation can be observed in particular we will discuss the microwave characteristics of the shunting capacitor which reduces the bare plasma frequency of the josephson junction more generalized discussion on the requirements of the shunting impedance for observing bifurcation can be found in ref the shunting capacitor has to be implemented carefully to ensure that it behaves as capacitor at the relevant frequencies with minimal parasitic resistance and inductance at higher frequencies ghz it is much easier and practical to use distributed circuit elements such as transmission line resonators this was one of the driving factors for the development of the cba which uses transmission line resonators with an embedded josephson junction to implement the nonlinear oscillator the first generation of our microwave capacitors were made using thin nm au ground plane this was followed by nb ground planes and nm and then thick cu imperfect screening currents in the capacitor plates due to the finite conductivity au and cu and thickness of the ground planes result in stray inductance ls and stray resistance rs figure depicts model that accounts for the stray inductance and resistance the samples made with superconducting nb ground planes did not have any stray resistance while the data for samples with au and cu ground planes lead to values of rs and respectively the lowest parasitic inductance ls nh was obtained with the cu ground planes while the other samples had value in the range of nh the presence of stray resistance results in dissipation in the oscillator and the phase shift in the reflected signal upon crossing the resonance is much less than the expected for lossless oscillator in the high power regime the samples with large stray resistance made transition into chaotic state before encountering the bistable regime this chaotic state is also observed in well behaved samples at higher powers black region in fig but there is large enough range of powers where the bistable regime is observed the stray inductance has similar effect as it increases the linearity of the oscillator thereby pushing the onset of the nonlinear regime to higher drive powers and closer to the chaotic state to summarize the stray parameters ls and rs reduce and in the worst case eliminate the available phase space where one can observe the bistable regime of the nonlinear oscillator for the jba with one should aim to achieve ls lj and rs for optimum results the jba chip is placed on low loss microwave circuit board and is wire bonded to the end of coplanar stripline which is soldered to coaxial launcher affixed to the side wall of the copper sample box we anchor the rf leak tight sample box to the cold stage of dilution refrigerator with base temperature of mk some preliminary data were also obtained in h cryostat with base temperature of mk the measurement setup including the values of filters and attenuators is shown in fig for frequency domain measurements microwave excitation signals are generated by hp vector network analyzer and are coupled to the sample via the db side port of directional coupler after passing through cryogenic attenuators the reflected microwave signal passes through the direct port of the coupler and is amplified first using cryogenic ghz high electron mobility transistor hemt amplifier with noise temperature tn before returning to the network analyzer the isolators on the return line allow microwave signals to propagate only in one direction and suppress the hemt amplifier input noise irradiating the sample by db to suppress noise outside the band of the isolators ghz we use lossy transmission line filters the attenuators on the input line carry out similar function by reducing the noise from higher temperature stages these components ensure that the intensity of the fluctuations at the sample correspond to the temperature of the cold stage to which it is anchored this is important for maximizing the sensitivity of the jba for the time domain measurements we used tektronix awg to create the pulse envelopes these envelopes were combined with cw microwave signals from synthesized microwave generator using analog mixers the reflected signal was then mixed down to lower frequency and digitized using gs digitizer from acqiris the phase was then determined by fitting this demodulated signal in software alternatively we also used an analog devices phase detector ad for directly converting the reflected signal phase into voltage this was the preferred method when the jba was being used as digital threshold detector and enabled rapid determination of the oscillation state with no software processing overhead for ultralow noise simultaneous dc and rf measurements on the same jba sample we developed fully differential measurement scheme as shown in fig v characteristic and low frequency switching current measurements are often required to extract system parameters such as the critical current and the effective temperature nonequilibrium noise is effectively rejected in low frequency measurements by using twisted pair cables with fully differential signals radio frequency signals on the other hand are traditionally single ended and are susceptible to common mode noise when combining low and high frequency measurements to remedy this problem we used hybrid coupler to create two out of phase rf signals which were then combined with the dc signals using two bias tees to create fully differential excitation this setup was used only for ultralow noise measurements such as the escape temperature measurements in the jba described at the end of sec b frequency domain measurements are used to characterize the nonlinear oscillator and extract circuit parameters the linear plasma resonance is located by sweeping the excitation frequency and measuring the reflection coefficient d d z z here is the characteristic impedance of our transmission lines and d is the impedance seen at the sample holder plane for an ideal lc resonator without intrinsic dissipation we expect phase shift p p the excitation power was kept low enough to access the linear regime of the oscillator in fig we present the reflected signal phase as function of excitation frequency for sample the point where is the linear regime plasma frequency for sample ghz the precise frequency and critical current dependence of the reflected signal phase of our samples can be explained by the lumped element model shown in fig the plasma frequency in the linear regime is determined by the total inductance lj ls and capacitance cs and is given by the following relation cs lj ls csi csls plot of versus lj is shown in fig for samples and as the critical current is decreased by applying magnetic field in the plane of the junction its inductance increases and the plasma frequency is reduced for each sample linear fit to the data of fig yields the values of cs and ls see table ii the fit values for cs agree well with simple estimates made from the sample geometry for samples with thin underlayer stray inductance in the range ls nh was observed for samples and with significantly thicker underlayer ls was reduced to and nh respectively this behavior is consistent with the calculated screening properties of our thin films using ls and cs we can accurately predict the observed resonant line shape solid line in fig in which rs samples with normal underlayer yielded finite values of rs we now discuss measurements of the power dependence of the plasma resonance the reflected signal phase as function of frequency for increasing power for sample is presented in the lower panel of fig as two dimensional color plot each row is single frequency sweep similar to fig for small excitation power we recover the linear plasma resonance at ghz indicated in yellow corresponding to as the incident power is increased beyond dbm the plasma frequency decreases as explained in sec ii for powers greater than dbm there is an abrupt transition from the phase leading green to phase lagging red state this marks the transition from the low amplitude state to the high amplitude state one can cross this transition by sweeping the power at fixed frequency also dashed line for powers in excess of dbm we encounter new dynamical regime black region in fig where appears to diffuse between the wells of the cosine potential this was confirmed by the presence of an unambiguous audio frequency ac resistance in the black region see ref in the lower panel of fig inset we illustrate the sequence of dynamical transitions by plotting as function of incident power at ghz for dbm the phase is independent of power and oscillates in single well in the harmonic like phase leading state letter for dbm dbm the phase evolves with power and still remains within the same well but oscillates in the anharmonic phase lagging state letter finally for dbm the average phase of the reflected signal saturates to corresponding to capacitive short circuit this last value is expected if hops randomly between wells the effect of which is to neutralize the josephson inductance to explain the complete frequency and power dependence of the transitions shown in the lower panel of fig we numerically solved the full circuit model shown in fig including the exact sinusoidal junction current phase relation the result of this calculation is shown in the upper panel of fig it correctly predicts the variation in the plasma frequency with excitation power and the boundaries of the phase diffusion region the agreement between theory and experiment is remarkable in view of the simplicity of this model which uses only measured parameters the measurements described so far characterized the time averaged response of the josephson oscillator under continuous microwave excitation we will now describe the experiments that probed the dynamics of the jba at short time scales ns under pulsed microwave excitation data from sample are presented in this section we first characterized in detail the switching associated with the ol oh transition near the bifurcation point ib we excited the oscillator with two different readout pulse protocols in the first protocol the drive current was ramped from zero to its maximum value in ns and was then held constant for ns before returning to zero only the final ns of the constant drive period were used to determine the oscillation phase with the first ns allotted for settling of the phase histograms taken with mhz acquisition rate are shown in fig in the upper panel the two peaks corresponding to states ol and oh can be easily resolved with small overlap of the finite width of each peak is due to the output noise and is consistent with the system noise temperature of our microwave electronics in this first method the latching property of the system has not been exploited in the second protocol for the readout pulse we again ramp for ns and allow settling time of ns but we then reduce the drive current by and measure the reflected signal for ns in that latter period whatever state was reached at the end of the initial ns period is latched and this time is used to improve the signal noise ratio of the reflected phase measurement as shown in the lower panel of fig the two peaks are now fully separated with an overlap of allowing determination of the state oh probability with an accuracy better than this second protocol is well suited to precise time resolved measurements of or for applications where low noise follower amplifier is unavailable at the end of the pulse the amplitude is ramped back to zero in ns the ramp up and ramp down times depend on the quality factor of the resonator and we ensure that this process is adiabatic and there is no ringing in the oscillator this entire process can be repeated almost immediately since there is no heating due to the absence of on chip dissipation leading to very fast repetition rates mhz we then measured the switching probability curves or curves pswitch irf for different values of to evaluate the sensitivity of the jba using the readout protocol and the discrimination threshold shown in fig we obtain the switching probability curves shown in fig defining the discrimination power as the maximum difference between two curves which differ in we find that at mk for i the switching probability curves should shift according to ib ib i eq which for our case takes the value of in fig the curves are shifted by which agrees well with this prediction as discussed in sec ii the width of the curves depends on the effective intensity of fluctuations in the jba oscillator well designed experimental setup will ensure that this intensity of fluctuations is set by the thermal quantum fluctuations corresponding to the operating temperature of the jba it is possible to determine the effective temperature characterizing these fluctuations by measuring the escape rate from state ol to oh as function of the various bias parameters the classical theory of escape was briefly described in sec ii in the quantum regime p kb the effective intensity of fluctuations is given by setting teff kb the full expression for the escape temperature is given by eq we will now describe the procedure for measuring the escape rate from the low amplitude state of the jba the jba was biased with long trapezoidal pulse at frequency with amplitude irf the pulse ramp time used was ns the total pulse length was ms the phase of the reflected pulse is analyzed and the time iswitch at which the jba makes transition from low to high amplitude state is recorded the experiment is repeated typically for times we then construct the probability pl of the jba being the low amplitude state aspl i iswitch where is the heaviside unit step function the probability pl decays exponentially with decay constant given by the escape rate escrf pl exp escrf so by fitting an exponential to pl we can determine escrf irf for different bias amplitudes irf the results are shown in fig where we have plotted the reduced escape rate escrf irf log escrf given by escrf irf uescrfkbtescrf irf ib as function of ief ib for selected values of bath temperatures data are shown for two samples with different resonant frequencies in panels and we observe straight lines with different slopes for different bath temperatures the slope slope and intercept int of the line are given by slope uescrfkbtescrf ib int uescrfkbtescrf from these two quantities we can determine the bifurcation current ib and escape temperature tescrf using the following formulae ib int slope tescrf uescrfkb int this confirms that the escape rate follows the behavior given by eqs and we can then extract the escape temperature tescrf for each operating point note that in the experiment we control irf by varying the pulse amplitude arf of the rf generator since irf arf we can plot escrf as function of arf and extract the bifurcation amplitude ab ib using eq once we have ab we can plot the data as function of arf ab which is the same as irf ib when plotted this way the straight lines should intersect escrf at irf ib at all temperatures since the bifurcation current ib and hence ab does not depend on temperature the data for each temperature in fig have been plotted after normalizing the axis with the value of ib ab extracted at the lowest temperature in practice we always observe small differences in the extracted values of ab at different temperatures as is evident from the data this could imply that the data start to deviate from the prediction of eq however we found that this variation was predominantly due to the slow increase in the attenuation of the input coaxial lines due to slowly decreasing levels of liquid helium in the dewar of the dilution refrigerator we observed that the extracted values of ab always increased with time even when the temperature was kept constant and reverts back when the liquid helium level is restored the data shown in fig take about days to acquire since one has to wait for the system to thermalize at each operating temperature during such long periods the liquid helium level can change appreciably we also verified that the extracted values of ab remained constant when noise was added to the system to artificially elevate the temperature all these checks were done to ensure that our experiment follows the prediction of eq and we can extract meaningful results for the value of tescrf in order to extract tescrf from the data we need the value of uescrf data from numerical simulations of the jba circuit yielded value for uescrf which was larger than those obtained from eq this would lead to smaller value for tescrf and we observed this discrepancy in the experiments in order to overcome this problem we used the following procedure to extract uescrf from the data itself at the highest temperature point we assumed tescrf since that is the expected result in the classical regime we can then use eq to extract uescrf kbtescrf int this extracted value of uescrf is then used for all the lower temperature points this is valid provided we can ensure that the intensity of fluctuations in the jba really correspond to the thermal fluctuations at that temperature we verified this by biasing the junction with dc current and measuring the escape rate from the superconducting to the normal state of the junction we used the procedure described in ref to measure the escape rates escdc idc and extract the dc escape temperature tescdc and found that the escape temperature varied linearly with bath temperature at high temperatures for our sample parameters the relation tescdc should be satisfied down to the lowest temperature of our fridge mk we only observed small discrepancy at the lowest temperatures which we attribute to improperly thermalized filters and unfiltered noise in the dual dc rf fig biasing configuration the blue and red arrows in fig indicate the smallest value of tescdc nevertheless the dc escape temperature data validate our normalization procedure described above figure plots tescrf extracted from the data shown in fig as function of bath temperature the solid lines are plot of eq with the corresponding values of used in the measurement the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent for both the samples with different resonant frequencies note that this is not fit to the data the only scaling of data performed as explained above is the extraction of uescrf from the highest temperature data point for each sample the results for tescrf not only agree with theory for the lowest temperature point but the functional dependence on temperature as we cross over from the classical kbt to quantum regime kbt is also well reproduced this verifies that the sensitivity of the jba when operated as digital threshold detector is only limited by quantum fluctuations qubit superconducting quantum bits qubits are electronic circuits with discrete energy levels and are thus artificial atoms as discussed in sec ii the transition from the low amplitude state to the high amplitude state of the jba depends sensitively on the critical current of the junction this can be used to readout the state of superconducting qubits we engineer the circuit such that the two quantum states of the qubit differ sufficiently in critical current to induce switching in the jba when it is biased in the bistable regime this approach has been applied to charge phase flux and transmon qubits and is currently being explored in phase qubits as well we detail measurements of quantronium qubit using the readout protocol depicted in fig the qubit and the jba are phase coupled via the large junction the desired qubit state is prepared by applying the appropriate microwave pulses to the write port the readout operation is performed by applying microwave pulses to the read port which energizes the jba oscillator biasing the jba near its bifurcation point encodes the qubit state in the oscillation state of the jba the latter is ascertained by analyzing the reflected signal phase repeated measurements are then used to obtain the probability of switching from the low amplitude to the high amplitude state the measurement is arranged so that the switching probability is close to zero when the qubit is in its ground state while the switching probability is close to one when the qubit is in its first excited state ideally we would like the switching probability to be zero for qubit ground state and one for qubit excited state neglecting the dissipation induced in the transmission lines the total hamiltonian of the quantronium coupled to jba resonator is t box h res ref withh box ec cgu e ej cos cos res q cs ejr cos t this hamiltonian has been written supposing that the asymmetry between the two small junctions is zero and the dc values of the offset gate charge and loop flux have been adjusted to operate at the degeneracy point e cgu and zero flux in the loop here and e are the momenta conjugate to the generalized positions and respectively the control parameters t urf cos rft and t irf sin dt are analogous to electromagnetic probe fields in an atomic system and induce charge excitation of the write port and phase excitation of the read port respectively if we keep these two lowest states in the hilbert space of box ref and we express res in terms of the photon creation and annihilation operators we obtain an effective hamiltonianh eff cgu eec ej p a z a a i where ejr cs ej ejr ecr cs ecrejr the photon annihilation operator is related to by a ejr ecr which represents the decomposition of the gauge invariant phase difference into annihilation and creation operators of the plasma mode whose bare frequency is the operators and are the pauli spin operators and ecr cs is the single electron charging energy of the readout junction in this effective hamiltonian the expansion of cos is carried out only to the first anharmonic term which describes the nonlinear resonator dynamics with sufficient accuracy for bifurcation readout we now describe the role of each term in eq the first term describes the influence on the qubit of the charge port drive which is used to manipulate its state the second term describes the free evolution of the qubit at the larmor frequency ej we have supposed here that the ratio ej ec is sufficiently small that corrections to the larmor frequency involving ec are small to model the behavior of qubit samples with an appreciable ej ec ratio we would keep higher order terms yielding renormalized values of the coefficients in eq the third term describes the dominant coupling between the qubit and the resonator and results in the qubit state affecting the resonant frequency of the resonator note that this term commutes with the hamiltonian of the qubit when offering the possibility of quantum nondemolition measurements the fourth term is the consequence of the nonlinearity of the resonator and leads to decrease in the frequency of the resonator when its photon population increases as discussed earlier in sec ii finally the fifth term describes the excitation of the resonator by the drive current applied through the read port the coherence properties of different qubit samples were measured and typical results are shown in fig panel shows the rabi oscillation data the rabi decay time was found to be in the range depending on the sample and precise biasing conditions linear dependence of the rabi oscillation frequency rabi with the microwave drive amplitude urfmax was observed in agreement with the theory of driven two level quantum systems panel shows the decay of the excited state lifetime with typical lifetimes being in the range of the values of obtained with our dispersive readout are comparable with the results of vion et al but are significantly shorter than the values expected from coupling to well thermalized microwave environment shunting the qubit the loss mechanisms giving rise to the observed energy relaxation are not understood at this time panel shows the ramsey oscillation data which allow one to measure the decay time of qubit phase coherence during free evolution of the qubit state typical ramsey decay times observed were ns the ramsey fringes decay time has component due to energy relaxation and one due to pure dephasing t where represents pure dephasing in our measurements is usually dominated by pure dephasing which is due to fluctuations in the qubit transition frequency originating from offset charge noise recent qubit measurements using the cavity version of the jba show that the dephasing times are compatible with the magnitude of the typical offset charge noise seen in these systems immunity to charge noise can be achieved by increasing the ej ec ratio in these qubits and we observed some improvement in the pure dephasing time for such samples this strategy is implemented in new qubit implementations which use very large ej ec ratios to almost eliminate the gate charge dependence of the transition frequency panel shows the curves corresponding to the qubit being in the ground and excited states the open circles in blue and red correspond to data for the qubit ground and excited states respectively while the solid black line is the best fit through the ground state data the dashed black line is shifted version of the solid black line to match the excited state data for low switching probabilities this was done to indicate the small difference in the shape of the excited state curve resulting in the reduction in readout contrast the observed contrast for this data is about smaller than expected in set of experiments described in ref we used two readout pulses in succession to determine that loss of qubit population occurs even before the resonator is energized to its operating point we attribute this loss to spurious on chip defects as photons are injected into the resonator the effective qubit frequency is lowered due to stark shift via the phase port when the stark shifted frequency coincides with the frequency of an on chip defect relaxation of the qubit can occur typically the qubit frequency samples mhz before the state of the qubit is registered by the readout and three to four spurious resonances are encountered in this range presently this phenomenon seems to be limiting the qubit measurement fidelity the detailed back action of the jba on the qubit is still not fully understood and is topic of current research as discussed in sec one can replace the single junction in the jba with two junction squid to make sensitive flux detector magnetic flux coupled to the squid loop modifies its effective critical current and hence can be detected using the jba principle there are several modes in which such magnetometer can be operated biasing in the hysteretic regime permits digital readout similar to the qubit measurements described above and could potentially be used for spin state measurements of magnetic molecules it is also possible to bias in the vicinity of the bifurcation point where the response is nonhysteretic but the nonlinearity boosts sensitivity such device can detect fast flux changes which can be used to study the dynamics of nanomagnets it is important to distinguish jba magnetometer from conventional dc squid device and other rf biased squids in the dc squid the magnetometer is biased near the resistive transition where the static voltage is used to register flux coupled to the squid loop shunt resistor is used to suppress hysteresis in the current voltage characteristic such devices can exhibit bandwidth in excess of mhz with sensitivity but at the expense of dissipation in and around the squid the jba magnetometer is an inductive device in which the magnitude of the phase excursion is always less than thus avoiding the dissipation and back action associated with switching into the voltage state as such flux sensitivity alone is not sufficient to compare these two types of magnetometers as their measurement back action is very different radio frequency biased squids ref do not generate static voltage but typically do have phase excursions beyond single well of the washboard potential and the associated back action squids have also been operated in the inductive mode typically where the phase excursion is very small and the anharmonicity of the squid potential is not sampled in the jba magnetometer we discuss device where the quality factor is kept low for enhanced bandwidth and the squid is biased near the bifurcation point for enhanced sensitivity we built rf magnetometer by embedding tunnel junction squid in coplanar stripline resonator the principle of operation is exactly the same as the lumped element version with slight difference in the effective circuit figure shows schematic of this circuit and images of the magnetometer are shown in fig the device was fabricated using standard beam lithography with device parameters chosen to yield resonant frequency of ghz when the flux through the squid loop is zero the quality factor of the resonator was around superconducting coil was used to apply dc magnetic flux to bias the squid an on chip coplanar waveguide transmission line with short circuit termination was used to couple high frequency signals to calibrate the device the sample box along with the bias coil was enclosed in superconducting aluminum box to shield from magnetic noise the microwave measurement setup was similar to the one shown in fig but had additional lines to bias the coil and the on chip flux line the reflected signal phase as function of the bias flux and drive frequency is shown in the inset of fig as expected we observe the periodic dependence of the resonance frequency yellow color corresponding to zero phase as function of bias flux the reflected signal phase is plotted as function of drive power and frequency in fig and characterizes the nonlinear response of the resonator this plot is similar to fig but here the power was swept in both directions for given frequency the different sweep directions are interlaced in the plot the sweep direction only affects the hysteretic regime as observed in the striped region in the top left part one can clearly see the upper and lower bifurcation points for magnetometry the device was operated in the linear and the single valued nonlinear regime by adjusting the microwave power small changes in input flux are converted into small changes in the phase of the microwave signal reflected from the resonator forming the basis of detection in this technique the noise temperature of the microwave electronics sets the phase resolution and ultimately determines the magnetometer sensitivity in the linear regime the dominant noise contribution comes from the cold hemt amplifier assembly which has system noise temperature of about in order to characterize the performance of this device as flux sensor we carried out the following experiment the dc coil was used to bias the squid at sensitive point the fast flux line was then used to send small calibrated ac flux signal at frequency of hz vector network analyzer was used to determine the oscillations in the reflected signal phase which was then transferred to computer these oscillations were then fourier transformed and the signal to noise ratio snr of the resulting peak at hz was determined since we know the magnitude of the ac flux signal we can extract the value of the smallest flux signal which can be resolved with unity snr in hz bandwidth we call this number the effective flux noise in our system figure shows plot of the effective flux noise as function of microwave drive power for three different flux bias points different sample than one in fig one expects the snr to improve when larger microwave power is used to probe the resonator resulting in lower effective flux noise the dashed lines indicate the improvement expected if the resonator was linear the advantage of the jba principle is clearly visible as the nonlinearity sets in at higher drive powers see figs and under these bias conditions the jba exhibits significant parametric gain effectively lowering the system noise temperature and results in the lowest observed flux noise of hz for this device this demonstrates that microwave readout of squid can lead to fast sensitive flux detector one should note that it is possible to operate the magnetometer in the digital mode by biasing the oscillator in the bistable region as was done for the qubit readout in this mode the magnetometer is essentially bit flux sampler however for measuring continuous changes in flux it is more cumbersome mode of operation involving pulse preparation and processing and one would prefer the analog mode where only continuous microwave signal is required we tested the magnetometer in the digital mode data not shown as well and obtained similar effective flux noise performance we will conclude this section with some remarks about optimizing the performance of such magnetometer as mentioned earlier the system noise temperature of the amplification chain determines the lowest flux noise for given set of squid parameters in principle operating the jba at high parametric gain points should result in noise temperature approaching the standard quantum limit we are presently exploring this possibility the choice of the quality factor of the resonator is another important criterion for optimizing effective flux noise higher will give you larger phase shift per unit change in flux but at the cost of reduced bandwidth and possibly lower operating powers which can even make the effective flux noise worse as the data suggest accessing the nonlinearity of the squid gives you enhanced performance even for low device however this also comes at the cost of reduced bandwidth data not shown since gain bandwidth for such systems is fixed another parameter that influences the effective flux noise is the drive power and in principle one can improve the performance by increasing it in practice there is always maximum operable limit for given device due to its finite dynamic range of operation g entering the bistable regime in the jba one could also trade off nonlinearity for higher operating powers by reducing the coupling of the squid nonlinear device to the resonator linear device but this will predictably decrease the phase shift per unit change in flux to summarize quality factor nonlinearity operating power and noise temperature are related to each other in complex way and we are presently exploring strategies to optimize for minimum effective flux noise and maximum bandwidth the josephson bifurcation amplifier jba exploits the bifurcation dynamics of the microwave driven plasma oscillation of josephson junction when biased near the bifurcation point the driven voltage response varies strongly with the plasma frequency which is modulated by weak external signal parametrically coupled to the critical current of the junction thus giving rise to amplification the josephson bifurcation amplifier is capable of both analog and digital dispersive measurement with variable gain we have demonstrated experimentaly the principle and operation of this novel amplifier by observing the josephson plasma oscillation transition between the two dynamical states predicted for driven nonlinear system using different samples we have shown that this dynamical phenomenon is stable reproducible and can be precisely controlled thus opening the possibility for practical applications such as amplification signal coupled to the critical current of the junction can be detected by monitoring the changes in the dynamical state of the nonlinear oscillator this approach was used to develop nonlinear dispersive readout for superconducting qubits by coupling cooper pair box with the jba in order to perform readout the resonator is rf energized to level where its oscillation state now acts as sensitive pointer of the qubit state this technique does not generate any dissipation on chip since the resonator is only damped by circuitry outside the chip e transmission line with matched circulator and amplifier and enables high fidelity qubit readout with megahertz repetition rate we have measured rabi oscillations and ramsey fringes with sufficient speed that real time filtering to correct for drifts in the charge and flux bias becomes possible also several successive readouts may be performed within the energy relaxation time of the qubit this gives valuable information on the readout induced interaction between the qubit and its environment and accounts for the observed contrast we also exploited the jba principle to construct high speed magnetometer this was done by incorporating tunnel junction squid in coplanar stripline resonator operating at ghz using the nonlinearity of the squid we were able to achieve an effective flux noise of about hz further improvements are possible by optimizing the flux to critical current transfer function of the squid this method can be extended to high speed magnetometry of single molecule magnets by replacing the tunnel junction squids with nano squids which use nanoconstrictions as the josephson elements the advantage of the jba over other dissipative amplification techniques such as the dc squids resides in its minimal back action since there is no on chip dissipation the only source of back action is the matched isolator load which is efficiently thermalized at the bath temperature an important point is that in the jba only fluctuations from the load that occur in narrow band centered about the plasma frequency contribute to the back action whereas in the dc squid noise from many high frequency bands is also significant finally the bifurcation amplifier does not suffer from quasiparticle generation associated with hysteretic squids ref and dc current biased junctions which switch into the voltage state long quasiparticle recombination times at low temperatures limit the acquisition rate of these devices while the recombination process itself produces excess noise for adjacent circuitry  the relationship between pulse accumulation and radial heat conduction in pump probe transient thermoreflectance ttr is explored the results illustrate how pulse accumulation allows ttr to probe two thermal length scales simultaneously in addition the conditions under which radial transport effects are important are described an analytical solution for anisotropic heat flow in layered structures is given and method for measuring both cross plane and in plane thermal conductivities of thermally anisotropic thin films is described as verification the technique is used to extract the cross plane and in plane thermal conductivities of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite results are found to be in good agreement with literature values pump probe transient thermoreflectance ttr has been widely used to study thermal transport in thin films and bulk materials liquids and across material interfaces all of these experiments are variations of the optical pump probe technique in which pump pulse is used to excite the sample changing the optical properties and second time delayed probe pulse measures the change the change is subsequently correlated with physical property of interest usually through the thermoreflectance coefficient of thin top layer of metal the fine temporal resolution of the technique makes it well suited to the study of wide range of transport processes occurring on time scales from femtoseconds to nanoseconds and longer typically the data are compared to model of the system and the unknown physical properties of interest are adjusted to minimize the error between the model and the data popular implementation of ttr has been to use high repetition rate pulse source such as the fundamental output of ti sapphire laser oscillator which typically has pulsing frequency on the order of mhz for thermal measurement this approach has significant advantages over lower repetition rate amplified systems in addition to being significantly simpler and less expensive the high repetition rate allows for pump beam modulation and lock in detection at high frequencies where laser power fluctuations can be reduced to the order of hz and the relatively weak pulse energies limit temperature excursions of the sample to few kelvins however at high repetition rates for many situations there is no sufficient time for the system to return to equilibrium between laser pulses in this case the effects of multiple pulses accumulate and the measured signal will differ from the response to single pulse as we will see the majority of thermal conductivity measurements fall into this category several treatments of accumulating photothermal pulses have been given in the past for various techniques one dimensional analysis was given in the context of photothermal rate window spectrometry accumulation phenomena were first described in the context of ttr by capinski and maris in terms of the impulse response of the sample assuming one dimensional thermal transport and subsequently expressed in terms of the frequency response by cahill to account for radial heat conduction in layered isotropic media what is not obvious is why radial transport effects are important in ultrafast pump probe measurements the time required for the response to an essentially instantaneous heat pulse to decay to negligible value yields thermal penetration depth that is much smaller than the laser spot size and it is commonly assumed that one dimensional transport is an adequate model in work where radial effects are considered different criterion for one dimensional transport is suggested the penetration depth of the thermal waves at the modulation frequency should be much smaller than the laser spot size since the lowest frequency component of the thermal response that contributes to the signal is the modulation frequency of the pump beam however it is not immediately clear how radial effects enter into the solution or which thermal length scale dominates under given set of experimental conditions in this work we show explicitly how it is pulse accumulation that leads to radial transport effects and describe the conditions under which radial transport is important we will see that although pulse accumulation complicates the analysis it also makes ttr more powerful by allowing two length scales to be probed simultaneously in addition an analytical solution for heat flow in layered media is given to account for anisotropic thermal conductivity which is frequently encountered in natural and man made thin film and bulk materials we show how by varying the modulation frequency and laser spot size in ttr measurement both in plane and cross plane thermal conductivities can be isolated using two color implementation the technique is applied to highly ordered pyrolytic graphite hopg well known thermally anisotropic material results are in good agreement with literature values various implementations of high repetition rate ttr systems are described in literature although the specific details of implementation vary the essential elements do not from an analysis point of view there are three key features the laser emits train of ultrashort pulses that are sufficiently short compared to the measurement time scale and pulse repetition period to be considered dirac delta functions the laser output is split into two trains which are then separated in time by an adjustable delay and the pump beam is modulated at reference frequency and lock in detection is used to extract only the components of the measured signal in an extremely narrow band around the reference signal it is assumed that the response of the sample to the laser input is both linear and time invariant lti this assumption greatly simplifies analysis since we can use all the mathematical tools available for lti systems such as superposition convolution and simple conversion between the time the frequency domains in conduction heat transfer if the temperature changes are small enough that physical properties can be assumed constant then the temperature of the system obeys superposition in addition the thermoreflectance coefficient must be linear with temperature over the range of temperatures induced in experiment under typical experimental conditions both the temperature rise due to single pulse and the steady state accumulation of heat will be on the order of few kelvins or smaller so linearity should hold the assumption is easily checked by changing the input power and by verifying that the measured signal scales correctly and does not change shape for clarity the measurement process is depicted graphically in figs and figure shows the pump beam as train of delta functions at the pulsing frequency of the laser the time between pulses is typically on the order of ns the pump beam passes through modulator usually an electro optic modulator eom or acousto optic modulator which chops the beam with square wave modulation at the reference frequency fig because lock in detection is used ideally the response to both the dc offset and the higher harmonics will be rejected and we need only consider the fundamental modulation component at shown in fig if the lock in amplifier mixes the signal with square wave instead of pure sinusoid resonant filter between the photodiode and the lock in amplifier can be used to effectively remove the higher harmonic components the thermal response of the sample is given by the convolution between the thermal response to single heat pulse the impulse response and the modulated pulse train because as we discussed in the preceding paragraph the lock in effectively removes any dc offset and higher harmonics we can convolve the impulse response with the fundamental harmonic component of the eom with no offset fig neglecting all other frequencies gives the appearance that some of the heat pulses have negative contribution if all frequencies were included then the sample temperature would increase during the period when the eom allows pulses through and decrease when the pulses are blocked the probe pulses arrive at the sample delayed from the pump pulses by the delay time and are reflected into the detector with an intensity proportional to the surface temperature of the sample fig although the probe pulses also heat the sample and can in general be as strong or stronger than the pump pulses this effect is not shown in figs and and can usually be ignored this is because the probe beam is unmodulated the time domain representation of the probe beam isp qprobe t nt which has the fourier transform qprobe k s i here is the dirac delta function is the period between pulses is the delay time between pump and probe pulses qprobe is the energy per probe pulse and t equation evaluates to zero for all frequencies except multiples of in our experiments mhz is one to two orders of magnitude larger than the modulation frequency mhz we typically use lock in time constant of ms which gives pass band of roughly hz therefore all of the probe frequencies will be well outside the lock in pass band and we can safely ignore the probe pulses effect on the measurement and view them as simply measuring the state of the thermal system at time after the pump pulses the lock in amplifier measures the fundamental component of the probe signal at the modulation frequency and rejects all other harmonic components this is shown in fig the output will be the amplitude and phase of the fundamental component of the probe signal with respect to the reference wave at every delay time mathematically the solution takes the form of transfer function complex number such that the output of the lock in amplifier for reference wave ei is given byaei z ei the transfer function can be represented in two ways the first given by capinski and maris is in terms of the impulse response of the sample t qqprobet h qt i qt where is the power per pump pulse qprobe is the power per probe pulse and is constant that includes the thermoreflectance coefficient and gain of the electronics mathematically equivalent form was later given by cahill in terms of the sample frequency response z qqprobet h s eik where again is the reference frequency and t the equivalence of eqs and stems from the fact that in lti system the impulse response and frequency response are fourier transform pairs in practice eq may be more convenient for numerical simulations while eq is more convenient for cases where an analytical heat transfer solution is more easily obtained in the frequency domain in the limit that the time between pulses becomes infinite both expressions reduce to the impulse response as function of delay time limt qqprobet e h qt qqprobeth i since at very long times qt decays to zero for all terms where in this limiting case the phase shift is simply the delay between the pump and probe pulses divided by the modulation frequency as expected and the amplitude of the signal can be directly interpreted as the response of the sample to single pulse in this case the relevant time and length scales are those associated with the single pulse response in the other limit as approaches zero the expression approaches the frequency response e the steady periodic response at limt qqprobet e h qt qqprobet in this case the relevant time and length scales are those associated with the steady periodic response in the intermediate range where the decay time of the system is not much longer or shorter than the pulse period the signal has elements of both the impulse response and the steady frequency response and the two effects cannot be easily separated to examine this further we take simple exponential system as model and see how the measured signal changes as the decay rate and laser pulse period are varied although the thermal response of sample is more complex the basic features of the accumulation effects will be the same the impulse response and frequency response of the simple system are given byh e at a where is the exponential decay time constant figure plots the amplitude of eq using fixed exponential decay time for three different pulse periods a and when the pulse period is or greater is essentially the single pulse response as the decay time approaches the pulse period the baseline signal for begins to shift upward and the shape of the signal changes if the baseline is subtracted and the signals are normalized at common time point the signals where a appear to decay faster this can potentially lead to incorrect interpretation of the results such as thermal conductivity value that is too large figure illustrates the accumulation effects from different perspective the pulse period is fixed and the exponential decay time is varied from t to t the amplitude signal is shown normalized to the amplitude of the steady periodic response at t the response has zero baseline and is identical to the single pulse response but by the time t the response is converging on the steady periodic amplitude in the former case the impulse response sets the relevant time and length scales while in the latter the periodic response dominates and between these both are important equations and are valid for any lti system the example of exponential decay is useful as simple means of showing the circumstances under which accumulation becomes important and how it connects the impulse response to the periodic response now we replace the exponential decay with the thermal response of multilayered sample heated and probed by gaussian laser spots including both the cross plane and in plane thermal conductivities of each layer thermal conduction through layered structures in isotropic media has been described in several places and cahill gave specific solution for ttr here we adopt the approach described by carslaw and jaegar for one dimensional conduction and extend it to account for radial anisotropic effects using hankel transformation for single slab of material in the frequency domain the temperature and heat flux ft on the top side of the slab are related to the temperature and heat flux fb on the bottom side through bfb cosh qd zqsinh qd zq sinh qd cosh qd tft here is the layer thickness the cross plane thermal conductivity and i where is the thermal diffusivity multiple layers are handled by multiplying the matrices for individual layers together bfb mnmn abcd tft where mn is the matrix for the bottom layer an interface conductance is treated by taking the limit as the heat capacity of layer approaches zero and choosing and such that z if the bottom surface of the nth layer is assumed to be adiabatic or if the nth layer is treated as semi infinite then in both cases eq reduces to t dft and the surface temperature will be given by dcft where ft is the heat flux boundary condition applied to the top surface in the majority of our experiments the semi infinite boundary condition is an accurate description of the physical situation equation can be conveniently extended to include the effects of radial conduction with zero order hankel transform applying the transform to the diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates and repeating the procedure described in eqs yields an identical result except that now in eq is given byq rk ci where and are the radial or in plane and cross plane thermal conductivities respectively is the density of the layer cp is the specific heat and is the transform variable the heat flux term at the boundary is given by the hankel transform of gaussian spot with power and radius the surface temperature from eq then becomesf dc exp w the frequency response in real space is found by taking the inverse hankel transform and then weighing the result by the probe intensity distribution which is taken as gaussian spot with radius h k dc exp w dk where and are the pump and probe radii respectively this solution for the frequency response is inserted into eq which is solved numerically in practice an upper limit of integration in eq on the order of w is sufficient for the integral to converge although if both radii become less than this value may need to be increased the case where the two beam spots are offset may also be used to study thermal transport li et al used this geometry and numerical simulation to determine the thermal properties of multilayer thin films by varying the frequency of modulated continuous wave beams here we extend eq to obtain an analytical solution for the case where the pump spot is separated by distance from the probe spot in the cartesian plain in this case some of the symmetry is lost and is given byh x y exp y dydx where x r is given by kj kr dc exp w dk and is zero order bessel function of the first kind while eq is not as convenient to evaluate as eq it is still tractable numerically in our ttr implementation we have found that sensitivity to radial transport is of similar order for offset spots compared to aligned spots however alignment of offset beam spots is somewhat more challenging than coaxial spots because the offset which is typically on the order of microns must be accurately determined in the case of aligned spots optimal overlap is indicated when the signal is maximized the one dimensional single pulse solutions for nm layer of al on two substrates si and sio are plotted in fig over ns the time between pulses from the ti sapphire oscillator silicon has relatively high thermal conductivity m at room temperature while the conductivity of sio is two orders of magnitude lower m in both cases but especially for sio the response clearly does not decay to zero before the next pulse arrives therefore accumulation effects will be important the solution will take on aspects of the steady periodic response and the associated thermal length scale compared to the spot size will determine the sensitivity of the solution to radial transport we use multidimensional least squares minimization routine to vary the physical parameters of interest to match the output of the lock in amplifier to eq either the amplitude or phase data can be compared to eq for fitting in practice we find that fitting to the phase produces more reliable results because it is slightly less noisy and removes any difficulties associated with normalization this approach is similar to fitting to the ratio of in phase and out of phase components of the lock in signal fitting the phase does introduce the problem of determining the true phase of the thermal signal with respect to the lock in reference wave the signal cables eom and photodiode all have their own response which collectively can be represented by the transfer function zinst such that for given input exp t the output will be given byainst exp t inst zinst exp t where inst is the phase delay introduced by the instrumentation thus to fit the phase data we need way to determine inst and subtract it from the measured phase one way to do this is to split off small fraction of the modulated pump beam and measure its phase directly with the detector second method which we employ is to make use of the fact that the out of phase or imaginary part of eq should be constant as the delay time crosses after the data are collected the change in the out of phase signal and in phase signal are noted as the delay time crosses from this the phase introduced by the instrumentation is computed from tan x and is subtracted from the measured signal to quantify the sensitivity of the signal to radial conduction we define the phase sensitivity to parameter in manner similar to that of gundrum et al sx d ln where the phase is in radians figure shows the sensitivity to the pump radius sw plotted as function of the substrate is sio and the probe radius is fixed at the values are plotted for delay time of ps although the curves look similar over the range of delay times the sensitivity is shown at modulation frequencies and mhz as expected at lower frequencies the signal is more sensitive to spot size since the thermal length scale increases with decreasing frequency as function of spot size sensitivity is maximized when the pump and probe spots are of similar order to put these curves into perspective the sensitivity to the cross plane thermal conductivity typical parameter of interest is plotted for the same sample under the same conditions in fig at mhz when the beam spots are of the same order the signal is approximately four times more sensitive to spot size than thermal conductivity e error is spot size leads to an error up to in the thermal conductivity fit on the other hand using pump spot radius of and modulation frequency of mhz the measurement is times more sensitive to cross plane thermal conductivity than spot size and in addition the relative uncertainty associated with measuring beam spot with m radius is small therefore for basic cross plane thermal conductivity measurements large pump spot and high modulation frequency are the best combination to reduce uncertainties due to beam spot geometry there are situations where small beam spots are desirable for example to increase the fluence at the sample surface or for high resolution spatial thermal conductivity mapping in these cases even at high frequency the sensitivity to spot geometry can be significant fraction of the sensitivity to thermal conductivity and care should be taken to accurately characterize the beam spots an interesting and somewhat counterintuitive aspect of the sensitivity to radial transport is that it increases with decreasing substrate thermal conductivity one might expect that lateral heat spreading would be more of an issue when the substrate thermal conductivity is higher however as we show in fig when the thermal decay of single pulse is long compared to the laser pulse period stronger accumulation effects cause the signal to approach the steady periodic solution and the associated periodic length scale plays more dominant part in fig we show the single pulse response for sio and si and clearly the thermal decay in the sio sample is much slower compared to the pulse time thus the measured signal eq will have stronger dependence on the periodic thermal length scale the spot sensitivity is plotted as function of the substrate thermal conductivity in fig the pump radius is fixed at and the probe radius is and again the delay time is fixed at ps as we expect the magnitude of the sensitivity increases at lower substrate thermal conductivities and increases with decreasing modulation frequency the sensitivity to cross plane thermal conductivity under the same conditions is shown in fig for reference anisotropic measurements we have examined the interplay between pulse accumulation and radial conduction and have shown how it affects the sensitivity of the measured signal to spot geometry in most cases the goal is to minimize the dependence of cross plane thermal conductivity measurement on the spot conditions in this case high modulation frequency is the best choice it is also possible to vary the modulation frequency and spot size to isolate the thermal conductivity in different directions measurement at high modulation frequency and with large spot size can be used to eliminate radial transport and to extract the cross plane thermal conductivity and the thermal interface conductance between the metal transducer layer and the substrate then second measurement can be made with smaller spot size and lower modulation frequency in this regime radial effects become import and the measurement may be sufficiently sensitive to in plane transport to extract the in plane thermal conductivity we demonstrate the technique with hopg it is highly anisotropic and its thermal properties are well known so it is convenient benchmark hopg has lamellar structure composed of stacked planes the bonding forces within the lateral planes are much stronger than those between the planes explaining its highly anisotropic elasticity and lattice thermal conductivity it is also characterized by large single crystal regions which can be expected to exhibit maximum mechanical and thermal anisotropies literature values for the cross plane thermal conductivity are on the order of m while the in plane thermal conductivity is around m or times higher than the cross plane value figure shows an image of hopg sample from our charge coupled device camera the large grains are clearly visible the sample has been coated with nm of al which serves as the thermal transducer the pump and probe spots were focused within the white circle in the image the details of our experimental setup have been given elsewhere unlike other ttr systems described in literature our pump beam is frequency doubled to nm this also allows us to use coaxial geometry where the pump and probe beams go through the center of the same objective lens onto the sample simplifying alignment and producing undistorted gaussian spots dielectric mirrors and color filters isolate the pump beam from the detector allowing us to measure relatively rough samples since the filters are not affected by scattering of the pump beam into different polarizations and angles pair of lenses focuses the pump beam onto the doubling crystal and recollimates it by adjusting the distance between the lenses we change the divergence of the beam and therefore can easily change the size of the focused pump spot on the sample from radii between and in fig the sensitivity of hopg to the in plane thermal conductivity is plotted as function of pump spot size all calculations use the best fit values for thermal properties as listed in table the delay time is fixed at ps and the probe radius is held constant at while the pump radius is varied at mhz modulation and when the pump radius is there is virtually no sensitivity to at lower frequencies and smaller pump spot sizes however the measurement becomes sensitive to radial conductivity figure shows both the phase and amplitude data along with best fit curves at modulation frequency of mhz probe radius of and pump radius of under these conditions the measurement is insensitive to the in plane conductivity and we find the cross plane thermal conductivity to be m and the al hopg thermal interface conductance to be mw k the density and specific heat of hopg were taken as kg and kg respectively following this measurement the pump spot radius was reduced to approximately and the measurement was repeated at two lower frequencies and mhz from the sensitivity analysis shown in fig with m pump radius we expect the measurement to be somewhat sensitive to at mhz and more sensitive at mhz in fig we plot the phase data and best fit curves at both frequencies and also the solutions obtained by varying by the cross plane conductivity and interface conductance values are taken from the high frequency measurement shown in fig while the in plane thermal conductivity was varied to match the data measurements were repeated at multiple fluence levels to ensure that the sample was not perturbed beyond the linear regime the thermal conductivity of hopg depends somewhat on the sample quality and preparation but typical room temperature values for the in plane thermal conductivity are on the order of m the best fit value obtained for the in plane thermal conductivity at mhz is m within of the room temperature literature value at mhz the value is m around higher than the mhz measurement this discrepancy most likely comes from small nonidealities in spot geometry such as slightly elliptical beam spots which would become more of factor at lower frequencies there is also more noise in the mhz signal due to increased noise in the laser power the results for hopg are summarized in table accumulation effects from high repetition rate pulse source such as ti sapphire oscillator are an important factor in thermal measurements because for the majority of materials the response due to one pulse does not fully decay before the next pulse arrives while this complicates the interpretation of the measured signal it also makes the technique more powerful by essentially probing two length scales simultaneously with clear understanding of this behavior one can minimize the impact of spot geometry on thermal measurement or appropriately manipulate the modulation frequency and spot size to rapidly extract both cross plane and in plane thermal properties of sample with two measurements  the design and performance of the first vacuum ultraviolet vuv laser based angle resolved photoemission arpes system are described the vuv laser with photon energy of ev and bandwidth of mev is achieved from the second harmonic generation using novel nonlinear optical crystal kbe bo the new vuv laser based arpes system exhibits superior performance including superhigh energy resolution better than mev high momentum resolution superhigh photon flux and much enhanced bulk sensitivity which are demonstrated from measurements on typical bi sr cacu high temperature superconductor issues and further development related to the vuv laser based photoemission technique are discussed angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy arpes is powerful tool in probing the electronic structure of solids when light illuminates on material it kicks out photoelectrons phenomenon well known as the photoelectric effect arpes measures the energy distribution of photoelectrons at different emission angles with respect to the sample surface normal thus directly measuring two fundamental quantities for describing the electronic state of solid e energy and momentum theoretically under the sudden approximation arpes measures single particle spectral function k with and representing momentum and energy respectively quantity that can be proposed or calculated from theoretical models the power of arpes in directly extracting electronic state information and its direct comparison between experiment and theory have made it prime choice in studying advanced materials particularly high temperature superconductors and other strongly correlated electron systems because most of the macroscopic properties of material are dictated by its microscopic electron dynamics specifically within an energy range of few kbt kb being the boltzman constant and temperature near the fermi level high energy resolution has been long sought goal of photoemission technique in order to probe intrinsic electronic structures started in the early arpes has experienced dramatic improvement in its instrumental performance particularly in the last two decades that can be accounted for by couple of reasons first because it is an indispensable technique in band mapping of materials there has been strong impetus from the stringent requirement of prominent scientific issues to push the arpes technique forward among the numerous phenomena manifested by the correlated electronic materials one of the most fascinating examples is high temperature superconductivity which has been at the forefront of condensed matter physics research since its discovery in later on collossal magnetoresistive materials and other exotic and extreme quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics have been discovered second the development benefits greatly from the synchrotron radiation technology its development from the first generation to the contemporary third generation has provided the photoemission technique high performance light source with high energy resolution high photon flux and photon energy tunability third the advancement of photoemission technique has benefitted profoundly from the dramatic advancement of electron detection technology with the advent of an advanced electron energy analyzer from scienta in the middle the energy resolution experienced jump from long staggering mevto mev which can now reach mev or better for the latest electron analyzers particularly the evolution of electron detection from one dimensional to two dimensional scheme has not only improved the angular resolution from previous to nearly but greatly enhanced the efficiency in data acquisition and the way of arpes data analysis it is now routinely possible to get an energy resolution around mev and angular resolution of combining the latest synchrotron radiation light source and an advanced electron energy analyzer the latest development has elevated arpes technique from traditional band mapping tool to probe of many body effect e the interaction of electrons with other entities such as electrons phonons etc in solid some prominent scientific issues such as mechanism of high temperature superconductivity and potential necessity in developing new theoretical paradigm for strongly correlated electron systems have set even higher standard on the photoemission technique one is apparently the further improvement of energy and momentum resolution various energy scales on the order of mev such as superconducting energy gap in conventional superconductors some high temperature superconductors and other recently discovered novel superconductors ask for an energy resolution of arpes system to be near mev or better the probing of many body effects specifically the mode coupling in the electron self energy also asks for such superhigh energy resolution one obvious characteristic of present arpes technique is its extreme surface sensitivity this is related to the short inelastic mean free path in the photon energy range of interest between the energy range of and ev that is most commonly used for valence band photoemmsion the corresponding inelastic mean free path is only on the order of e representing only the topmost one or two layers of the sample while this surface sensitivity is beneficial for surface study it may stand out as serious drawback in probing bulk properties for understanding problems of the bulk nature such as in high temperature superconductors it has been long standing concern how much the photoemission measured results are representative of the bulk properties to overcome this shortcoming one approach is to move to the high photon energy which will enhance bulk sensitivity g at ev the corresponding inelastic mean free path can be increased up to however this slight enhancement of bulk sensitivity is achieved at sacrifice of signal intensity lower energy resolution and poor momentum resolution another way to enhance bulk sensitivity is to move to lower photon energy lower photon energy also makes it easier to achieve high energy resolution and gives rise to better momentum resolution even for the same angular resolution with these potential advantages it seems to be natural choice to develop laser based photoemission technique and this idea indeed has been around for long time however number of requirements have to be satisfied before laser can be used for high resolution photoemission high photon energy for photoemission process to occur the photon energy must be large enough to overcome the work function of the material under measurement since work function of ev is common photon energy larger than ev is essential high photon flux the laser to be used must have enough photon flux to get decent photoemission signal narrow bandwidth the bandwidth of the laser will be major factor in determining the overall instrumental energy resolution to get high energy resolution narrow bandwidth of laser is necessary continuous wave cw or quasicontinuous wave laser because photoemission process involves the space charge effect that may shift the energy position and broaden the linewidth it is preferable to use cw or quasi cw laser in order to minimize the space charge effect for getting high energy resolution compatible electron detector the relatively low energy of photoelectrons puts stringent demand on the electron energy analyzer that can not only work at such low electron kinetic energy but also has an energy resolution that is good enough to take full advantage of the narrow bandwidth of the laser theoretically there has been also concern whether the sudden approximation that has been the theoretical foundation for treating high photon energy photoemission process is still valid at low photon energy the recent progress in generating ultraviolet uv and vacuum ultraviolet vuv laser by utilizing nonlinear optical crystals has made big progress in laser photoemission using kbe bo kbbf crystal kiss et al developed quasi cw vuv laser with photon energy of ev and applied to photoemission technique the system realized for the first time an energy resolution better than mev achieving an overall energy resolution of mev mev from the laser source and mev from the electron energy analyzer however the photoemission measurements reported so far have been confined to angle integrated mode independently dessau group reported successful development of uv laser based angle resolved photoemission setup the highest photon energy they can achieve is ev with linewidth of mev while the overall energy resolution of the system is mev compared with synchrotron light source much improved performance has been observed through using this uv laser based arpes syetsm however in addition to relatively poor energy resolution compared to the vuv laser used by kiss et al the relatively low photon energy limits the momentum space that can be reached particularly the inability to reach the antinodal region in high temperature superconductors and other related correlated electron systems poses as serious limitation in this uv laser based arpes setup in this article we report vuv laser based arpes system that not only has superhigh energy resolution better than mev but also with angle resolved mode that can cover larger momentum space specifically it can approach the antinodal region in high temperature superconductors and other related materials to our best knowledge this is the first vuv laser based arpes system with an energy resolution better than mev in the following sections we will describe the design of the experimental vuv laser arpes setup we will also demonstrate its superior performance by some testing and measuring on typical bi sr cacu bi high temperature superconductor figure shows photograph of our vuv laser based arpes system as labeled in the figure the setup is composed of two major parts the vuv laser optical system and the angle resolved photoemission spectrometer system the latter is further divided into four main components mu metal arpes measurement chamber scienta electron energy analyzer sample manipulator and cryostat and preparation chamber and sample transfer system in the following we will give more detailed description of these components individually the vuv simple and straightforward way to generate uv and vuv lasers is to utilize the higher harmonic effect of the nonlinear optical nlo crystal good vuv nlo crysal should have large nlo coefficient short absorption edge below nm and moderate birefringence for practical use the birefringence should be moderate figure summarizes the shortest second harmonic generation shg wavelength available for the typical and well developed nlo crystals even though bab bbo and lib lbo are very useful for second harmonic generation from visible to ultraviolet all the way to nm their capabilities below nm are severely limited in the case of bbo since the absorption edge is at nm it can only achieve shg output not shorter than nm for lbo although the transparent range is wide the phase matching is limited by its small birefringence as result the shortest shg output wavelength is only nm under phase matching conditions kbe bo kbbf is novel uv nlo crystal that can break the nm wavelength barrier and enter the vuv region it has large nlo coefficient of pm good birefringence of and very short cutoff wavelength of nm so far it is the only crystal available that enables phase matching below nm for shg however major obstacle of using kbbf lies in its platelike nature it is difficult to grow large sized kbbf crystal thicker than mm such thin crystal cannot be cut at the phase matching angle to solve this problem chen et al developed prism coupling technique prism coupled technique device pct as schematically shown in fig which is composed of kbbf crystal sandwiched in between two caf prisms with proper apex angle the two interfaces between kbbf and caf prisms were brought into optical contact and they are pressed from both sides by two stainless steel pieces with four screws to maintain long term optical contact at present the transmission loss per interface is approximately by using this kbbf pct device and nm wavelengths have been demonstrated which are the shortest achieved so far by nonlinear crystals for shg and sum frequency mixing sfm respectively the nm vuv laser used in our arpes system is generated by frequency doubling of the original nm laser through the kbbf pct device the related optical system is schematically shown in fig the key element is an optically contacted kbbf caf prism coupled device the thickness of kbbf is mm the kbbf pct device sits on stage with xyz translation and one rotation in order to adjust the position and phase matching angle the kbbf pct stage together with the two following reflection mirrors are motor controlled from outside of the optical chamber the nm laser comes from frequency tripled nd yvo laser vanguard spectra physics which produced train of ps pulses with repetition rate of mhz and maximum output power of it is introduced into the frequency doubling chamber by pair of reflection mirrors and focus lens after frequency doubling through the kbbf pct device the nm vuv laser is reflected by two mirrors and focused onto the sample position in the measurement chamber because the nm can easily be absorbed by air the kbbf pcf device and all the optical elements hereafter are put inside an optical chamber the chamber is filled with inert gas such as helium or nitrogen complete inert gas exchange is necessary or the remnant air in the optical chamber can significantly reduces the nm laser power the optical chamber and the arpes measurement chamber are separated by caf window which can allow the nm laser pass through while keeping the ultrahigh vacuum of the measurement chamber intact the and nm lasers have linear polarization with the vector pointing to the vertical direction the advantages of our ev vuv laser over ev uv laser lie in both the superior energy resolution and larger momentum space coverage the linewidth of our vuv laser is mev while it is mev for the uv laser at ev the maximum in plane momentum covered is taking work function of ev that is common for high tc materials while it is for ev the advantage of larger photon energy is obvious here because vuv laser can reach the important antinodal region of high tc materials and other transition metal oxides the corresponding momentum is with being the lattice constant for high tc materials so corresponds to momentum of advanced angle resolved photoemission the spectrometer system has been designed to be compact efficient and user friendly it is composed of mu metal measurement chamber electron energy analyzer sample manipulator and cryostat and preparation chamber and sample transfer system ultrahigh vacuum mu metal measurement in an angle resolved photoemission measurement the photoelectron emission angle carries important information about its momentum to keep the trajectory of the photoelectrons intact the residual magnetic field near the sample region and on the way to the electron analyzer must be minimized this is particularly crucial for laser based photoemission system because photoelectrons with low kinetic energy are more susceptible to small magnetic field to best screen the earth field or the magnetic field from surrounding environment we have made our measurement chamber directly using mu metal in addition another mu metal magnetic shield liner is added inside the mu metal chamber and all the ports are connected with long mu metal sleeves the liner is tightly coupled to the outside one of the two mu metal layers of the electron energy analyzer the measurement chamber and electron energy analyzer are demagnetized together after assembly with all these delicate configurations the remanent field in the sample region reaches very low level with three components of and mg an overall magnitude of mg the measurement chamber is connected to cryopump and an ion pump for reaching ultrahigh vacuum after baking it can reach base pressure better than torr it is also equipped with gammadata high flux discharging lamp with toroidal grating monochromator which can provide uv light at ev helium and ev helium ii the photoelectron signal is measured using high resolution hemispherical electron analyzer gammadata scienta one of the outstanding features of this analyzer is its high energy resolution that reaches the sub mev region for example with slit size of mm and pass energy of ev the energy resolution of the analyzer can approach mev this is well matched to the extremely narrow linewidth mev of our vuv laser source to give an overall energy resolution better than mev another unique feature of the analyzer lies in its two dimensional detection scheme that can measure the intensity of photoelectrons over wide angle range simultaneously since the kinetic energy of photoelectrons excited by our vuv laser is rather low it was big challenge to make the angular modes work at such low kinetic energies the performance of the angular mode also depends sensitively on the spot size on the sample much effort has been placed into optimizing the angular mode lens tables that satisfies the stringent requirements of low energy laser arpes we have three angular modes that can cover and and three sets of such lens tables for the spot size of and mm respectively the angular mode is particularly useful for covering large momentum space at the same time the sample manipulator consists of three axis positioning device for xyz translation vg centiax translator and differentially pumped rotating platform vg rp for the polar rotation named hereafter of the sample the custom made low temperature cryostat has two axis rotations of the sample the tilt and azimuthal which is set on top of the rotary seal in this way the sample has access to all six degrees of freedom including three translations and three rotations all the translations and rotations are driven by stepping motors mcmillan motion control inc that are controlled through computer labview program is developed to control the six axis motions in versatile way such as absolute movement relative movement origin adjustment and position calibration and limitation the control accuracy and reproducibility of the angles are the accuracies of y and movements are and mm respectively the cryostat is cooled down by continuous flow of liquid helium and the lowest temperature the goniometer can reach is at the sample position the cryostat has button heater embedded near the end of the cold head that can vary the sample temperature between and controlled by an advanced proportional integral derivative pid temperature controller the sample temperature can be stabilized to be within the temperature is measured by standard si diode lakeshore dt with measurement accuracy of in order to minimize the sample position shift during sample temperature change due to thermal expansion contraction the goniometer is not attached directly onto the end of cryostat cold end instead it is mounted near the end of stainless steel tube surrounding the cryostat rod this supporting tube remains at room temperature so it does not experience expansion or contraction when the cryostat undergoes warming cooling process the goniometer is connected to the cold end of the cryostat through flexible copper braid copper radiation shield is installed to reduce radiation heating of the sample stage in order to thoroughly eliminate the stray magnetic field in the sample region special caution is taken to assure that only nonmagnetic components and materials are used in the goniometer and cryostat fabrication preparation chamber above the mu metal measurement chamber is sample preparation chamber which is separated from the measurement chamber by an uhv gate valve this configuration makes it easy and time saving for cryostat maintenance the preparation chamber is equipped with wobble stick for cleaving samples sputtering gun for cleaning sample and low energy electron diffraction leed for sample surface characterization it also hosts residual gas analyzer rga for leak checking the preparation chamber is connected to the sample transfer system that can transfer samples in and out of the preparation chamber from air without baking or breaking ultrahigh vacuum in the preparation chamber the sample transfer system consists of two stages separated by valve when transferring samples the first stage is vented and loaded with samples after pumping to vacuum of torr the samples can be transferred into the second stage with better base pressure of torr and further transferred to the preparation chamber the energy resolution of the vuv laser arpes system is calibrated by using the fermi edge of cleaned polycrystalline gold as shown in fig measured using ev pass energy and mm analyzer slit of the electron energy analyzer here the gold is attached directly to the end of the cryostat so it can reach lower temperature of by fitting the fermi edge with fermi distribution function the width is obtained to be mev after subtracting the temperature broadening contribution corresponding to mev one gets an overall energy resolution of the vuv laser arpes system as mev this overall width is usually composed of three main contributions vuv laser linewidth mev analyzer resolution for ev pass energy and mm slit an ideal energy resolution is mev contribution of space charge effect which depends on photon flux spot size and other factors in this case the contribution from the laser source and the analyzer gives an energy resolution of mev that comes very consistent with the measured value mev note that because of relatively high sample temperature there is an uncertainty in getting precise energy resolution when trying to extract small contribution from the main contribution of temperature we did not use the best measurement condition e ev pass energy and mm slit of the analyzer to test the energy resolution because of the uncertainty in this case the combined energy resolution from both the vuv laser mev and the analyzer mev would amount to mev as demonstrated by kiss et al tested using low sample temperature we note that although we cannot test such high energy resolution because of our relatively high temperature of gold the performance of our arpes system is similar to that from kiss et al so the best energy resolution of mev can be expected also in our system photon the nm laser power generated right behind the kbbf pct device is measured with power meter lp physcience opto electronics co ltd beijing calibrated using green laser at nm calibration at nm is not available by national institute of metrology of china using kbbf pct with kbbf thickness of mm frequency doubling power of mw is achieved with w input power at nm as the input power increases or the thickness of kbbf increases higher nm laser power is achievable assuming that the calibration of the power meter at nm is close to that at nm mw corresponds to nm photon flux of photons this photon flux is nearly two or three order of magnitude higher than that available from third generation synchrotron undulator beamlines in the mean time the bandwidth of our vuv laser mev is more than one order of magnitude better than the synchrotron radiation usual working resolution mev the best working resolution is mev ref the nm output power is stable within drift in period with less than temperature change in the environment such high stability is ideal for running an arpes experiment due to heat accumulation and radiation damage local in the caf or kbbf crystals may get damaged and the incident position of the nm laser on the kbbf pct device needs to be changed periodically the performance of the angular mode is tested using special scienta wire and slit device which is composed of thin wire and set of slit an electron gun hits the wire and the scattered electrons pass through the slit and are detected by the analyzer the wire and slit are arranged in the way that the spacing between the adjacent two lines represents known emission angle in our case figure shows examples of the test patterns that are collected at and ev pass energies respectively and angular mode with mm spot size it gives constant dispersion over wide kinetic energy range with kinetic energy as low as ev this makes it suitable for performing arpes measurements using ev vuv laser where the highest kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is nearly ev with common work function of ev the angular resolution of the analyzer is also tested using the same wire and slit device for mm spot size it is for the angular mode while it is for the angular mode note that the angular resolution is sensitive to the spot size the smaller the spot size the better the angular resolution since it is not possible to do the angular resolution test for the mm spot size using the same wire and slit scheme the exact angular resolution is not known for our mm laser spot although the upper limit is estimated to be definitely much less than for the angular mode note that since the momentum resolution near the fermi level is related to the angular resolution by h wcos with being the photon energy the work function and the angle with respect to the sample normal direction the low photon energy of our vuv laser will give better momentum resolution around the fermi level even for the same angular resolution for example with ev the momentum resolution for ev is only times that for ev in high resolution angle resolved photoemission measurement one concern is about the uniformity of the energy across the entire detector angle range that is particularly important for small energy scale measurements this has been examined by measuring the gold fermi edge at low temperature ideally if the angular mode is working in perfect condition one would expect that the fermi edge positions obtained at different detector angles should be the same practically this may not happen because of potential mechanical or electrical defect associated with the analyzer figure shows the measured two dimensional image of the gold fermi edge using angular mode fig and the fitted fermi edge position as function of the detector angle fig the deviation of the fermi edge from its average position is less than mev over the entire angular window proving that the angular mode of our analyzer works in an excellent condition the vuv laser based arpes is expected to greatly enhance the bulk sensitivity in probing the the electronic structure of solids according to the universal curve of the electron escape depth versus electron kinetic energy the electron escape depth at the present photon energy of ev is near with big uncertainty that can extend to we note that this universal curve is mostly for simple metal systems whether it is applicable to complex oxide compounds is not clear yet while the absolute value of the electron escape depth may vary however one should expect enhancement of bulk sensitivity at lower photon energy even for transition metal oxides since it is difficult to carry out quantitative measurement of the electron escape depth we carried out qualitative test by measuring bi crystal sample treated at different environments first we cleaved nearly optimally doped bi sr cacu bi sample tc in situ in the ultrahigh vacuum and measured along the nodal direction at temperature of result is shown in fig the same cleaved sample was then pulled out from the measurement chamber and exposed under atm for in the second stage of the sample transfer system it was then measured again along the same direction at as shown in fig then the sample was pulled out and stayed in the air for and measured again the measured image is shown in fig we note that all three measurements were carried out in ultrahigh vacuum condition it is clear that when the sample surface gets dirtier from the exposure to nitrogen and then air the signal is getting weaker and the secondary scattering at high binding energy is apparently getting stronger but the basic spectral features are still maintained in spite of such dirty environment situation not possible for high photon energy such as ev this enhancement of bulk sensitivity will not only extend the lifetime of the sample but also makes the surface preparation less stringent for example it is possible to work on some materials that are hard to cleave by mild cleaning process such as annealing or sputtering space charge effect one concern surrounding the utilization of laser in photoemission is the space charge effect that may originate from its high photon flux and pulsed nature to check on the effect we have measured this on polycrystalline gold at low temperature using different laser powers the measured fermi level position and width as function of laser power on the sample are plotted in fig the fermi level exhibits nearly mev increase when the laser power on the sample goes up to corresponding to photon flux of photons we caution that the nm laser power here is measured using power meter that is calibrated using nm laser instead of nm laser so there could be difference while the corresponding fermi level width shows broadening of less than mev this clearly demonstrates that there is space charge effect involved in laser photoemission process but for our vuv laser the space charge effect is much weaker than that observed in synchrotron case the underlying reasons can be manifold first the use of the quasi cw laser with high repetition rate on the order of mhz is essential for minimizing possible space charging effects that may cause extra broadening of measured photoemission spectra second the space charge effect is directly related to the number of emitted electrons therefore the total number of electrons for the vuv laser is much smaller than that using high energy synchrotron because of the reduced energy window and secondary electrons third because the space charge effect is actually balanced by the mirror charge effect the combined effect relies on the duration of pulse as indicated in the simulation fig in ref the space charge effect and mirror charge effect nearly cancel each other in the range of ps pulse duration that is the range of our vuv laser while it grows with further increase of the duration in order to test the overall performance of our uvu laser arpes system we have chosen bi sample high temperature superconductor that has been most thoroughly studied by arpes technique because of its layered nature and easiness of cleaving to get smooth and clean surface figure shows the raw arpes data taken along the nodal direction at temperature of with an overall energy resolution of mev the kink feature near mev appears sharply in the raw data the superior quality of the data can be best illustrated from the energy distribution curve edc at the fermi momentum fig and the momentum distribution curve mdc at the fermi level fig the edc width measured from our vuv laser system for optimally doped bi is mev and mev for underdoped bi with tc which is much sharper than that from the synchrotron setup mev this is also sharper than that from the ev laser arpes measurement which gives width of mev this sharp feature can be attributed to the dramatic energy resolution improvement in our vuv laser arpes and lower sample temperature to our knowledge this is the sharpest edc along the nodal direction that has ever been reported in bi so far the mdc width is which is also much sharper than its synchrotron counterpart fig we note that the low energy photon also brings changes in the traditional way of the data analysis this becomes obvious in converting from the sample emission angle with respect to the sample normal to in plane momentum in unit of which takes form of h eisin with being the work function of the sample and ei the binding energy for high photon energy such as between and ev usually used in synchrotron small uncertainty in and neglecting ei give rise to little change in the momentum however for laser arpes with lower photon energy such as ev both the accuracy of and effect of ei become pronounced figure shows the converted pattern considering the binding energy correction the two momentum boundaries are no longer vertical and their spacing is shrinking with increasing binding energy this will have effect on edc line shape and particularly on dispersion extraction the effect will get more pronounced when the photon energy is even lower for example ev uv laser and should be taken into account in the data analysis in low energy arpes data the vuv laser has provided novel light source for photoemission technique its utilization has successfully broken the barrier of mev superhigh energy resolution that has been long sought dream in photoemission technique compared with synchrotron radiation light source it also provides an efficient convenient and cheap way in laboratory based arpes system with many unique advantages the superhigh energy resolution high momentum resolution superhigh photon flux and enhancement of bulk sensitivity have definitely elevated the photoemission technique into new level one concern related to the laser photoemission is the applicability of sudden approximation while the validation needs more theoretical and experimental efforts we note that the measured band dispersion fermi surface and overall qualitative spectral feature in bi are consistent with that measured at high photon energy particularly we have observed that the edc in bi measured at ev is even sharper than that measured at ev photons fig this indicates that the sharpness of edc in low energy arpes is more likely due to dramatic improvement in the instrumental resolution rather than the invalidity of sudden approximation while the vuv laser arpes possesses host of advantages over present synchrotron radiation source in terms of energy resolution momentum resolution photon flux and bulk sensitivity it has its limitations and further developments are needed the first limitation comes from its single fixed photon energy at ev as photoemission process involves matrix element effect where the observation of bands relies on the photon energy and polarization of the incident light one fixed photon energy may miss some energy bands and in the worst case may not be able to work on some materials development from single photon energy to tunable photon energy is necessary the second limitation is related to its polarization for the same reason of matrix element effect it is preferable to change the polarization vector of the linearly polarized light or change from linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light the acquisition of circularly polarized light will also help in studying magnetic materials or magnetism related physics issues the third limitation lies in its relatively low photon energy that leads to small coverage of momentum space the laser arpes may not be able to work on some materials with small lattice constants and larger brillouin zone to maintain all the advantages of the vuv laser particularly bulk sensitivity while reaching larger momentum space and considering practicality of the vuv laser technology modest energy increase from the present evto ev is preferable and feasible we note that besides high harmonic generation from the nonlinear optical crystals the application of lasers based on high harmonic generation from atoms or molecules are worth being explored in photoemission technique as they can not only provide the photon energy tunability which is big limitation of the present laser system but also higher photon energy these lasers are making rapid progress but presently average intensities and repetition rates are limited we also note that synchrotron light source is advantageous in its easy tunability over broad energy range and can get to the energy range provided by the vuv laser there have been efforts to push the energy resolution to the level of mev the higher repetition rate g mhz at the advanced light source than that of laser g mhz for our vuv laser is helpful in reducing space charge effect therefore the laser and the synchrotron source are complementary for photoemission experiments the application of vuv laser in angle integrated photoemission and present angle resolved photoemission is just start of whole slew of potential developments in photoemission techniques it is expected that the superhigh photon flux and supernarrow bandwidth of the vuv laser can enhance the performance of the spin resolved photoemission time resolved photoemission and spatially resolved photoemission techniques in similarly profound way for example the present spin resolved photoemission system suffers from poor energy resolution mev and most of them are operated in angle integrated mode this is mainly because the spin detector used has very low efficiency and the light sources used do not have enough photon flux to get decent spin resolved signal one has to increase the photon flux at the expense of energy resolution and using angle integrated mode to further increase the signal compared with the synchrotron radiation where the energy resolution and the photon flux are contradictory the superhigh photon flux and superhigh energy resolution of the vuv laser will make it an ideal source for spin resolved photoemission even with an angle resolved capability in summary we have developed the first vuv laser based angle resolved photoemission system with superhigh energy resolution better than mev in addition it possesses other unique advantages such as high momentum resolution superhigh photon flux and much enhanced bulk sensitivity this has elevated the arpes technique into new higher level providing powerful tool in materials science and physics further development of the vuv laser technology is in progress and this novel vuv laser source will bring significant development in many other photoemission related techniques  neutrino astronomy beyond the sun was first imagined in the late by the it was realized that kilometer scale neutrino detectors were required the first such instrument icecube is near completion and taking data the icecube project transforms km of deep and ultratransparent antarctic ice into particle detector total of optical sensors is embedded into gigaton of antarctic ice to detect the cherenkov light emitted by secondary particles produced when neutrinos interact with nuclei in the ice each optical sensor is complete data acquisition system including phototube digitization electronics control and trigger systems and light emitting diodes for calibration the light patterns reveal the type flavor of neutrino interaction and the energy and direction of the neutrino making neutrino astronomy possible the scientific missions of icecube include such varied tasks as the search for sources of cosmic rays the observation of galactic supernova explosions the search for dark matter and the study of the neutrinos themselves these reach energies well beyond those produced with accelerator beams the outline of this review is as follows neutrino astronomy and kilometer scale detectors high energy neutrino telescopes methodologies of neutrino detection icecube hardware high energy neutrino telescopes beyond astronomy and future projects soon after the observation of the neutrino the idea emerged that it represented the ideal astronomical messenger neutrinos travel from the edge of the universe essentially without absorption and with no deflection by magnetic fields having essentially no mass and no electric charge the neutrino is similar to the photon except for one important attribute its interactions with matter are extremely feeble so high energy neutrinos may reach us unscathed from cosmic distances from the inner neighborhood of black holes and hopefully from the nuclear furnaces where cosmic rays are born also in contrast to photons neutrinos are an unambiguous signature of hadronic interactions their weak interactions make cosmic neutrinos very difficult to detect immense particle detectors are required to collect cosmic neutrinos in statistically significant numbers by the it was clear that cubic kilometer detector was needed to observe cosmic neutrinos produced by the interactions of cosmic rays with background microwave photons newer estimates for observing potential cosmic accelerators such as quasars or gamma ray bursts unfortunately point to the same exigent requirement building neutrino telescope has been daunting technical challenge given the detector required size early efforts concentrated on transforming large volumes of natural water into cherenkov detectors that catch the light produced when neutrinos interact with nuclei in or near the detector building the deep underwater muon and neutrino detector dumand in the sea off the main island of hawaii unfortunately failed after two decade long effort however dumand paved the way for later efforts by pioneering many of the detector technologies in use today and by inspiring the deployment of smaller instrument in lake baikal as well as efforts to commission neutrino telescopes in the mediterranean the first telescope on the scale envisaged by the dumand collaboration was realized instead by transforming large volume of the extremely transparent natural deep antarctic ice into particle detector the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array amanda in operation from to it represented proof of concept for the kilometer scale neutrino observatory icecube which is the main focus of this article even extremely high energy neutrinos will routinely stream through detector without leaving trace the few that interact with nucleus in the ice create muons as well as electromagnetic and hadronic secondary particle showers the charged secondary particles radiate cherenkov light that spreads through the transparent ice characterized by an absorption length of or more depending on depth the light pattern reveals the direction of the neutrino making neutrino astronomy possible secondary muons are of special interest because their mean free path can reach km for the most energetic neutrinos the effective detector volume thus exceeds the instrumented volume for muon neutrinos the method is illustrated in fig photomultipliers transform the cherenkov light from neutrino interactions into electrical signals using the photoelectric effect these signals are captured by computer chips that digitize the shape of the current pulses the information is sent to the computers collecting the data first by cable to the counting house at the surface of the ice sheet and then via magnetic tape more interesting events are sent by satellite to the icecube data warehouse in madison wi essentially icecube consists of freely running sensors sending time stamped digitized waveforms of the light they detect to the surface the local clocks in the sensors are kept calibrated with nanosecond precision this information allows the scientists to reconstruct neutrino events and infer their arrival directions and energies the complete icecube detector will observe several hundred neutrinos per day with energies above gev the deepcore infill array will identify smaller sample with energies as low as gev these atmospheric neutrinos come from the decay of pions and kaons produced by the collisions of cosmic ray particles with nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere atmospheric neutrinos are background for cosmic neutrinos at least for energies below tev but their flux is calculable and can be used to prove that the detector is performing as expected at the highest energy small charm component is anticipated its magnitude is uncertain and remains to be measured as in conventional astronomy icecube looks beyond the atmosphere for cosmic signals in parallel the development of the technology for commissioning large detector deployed in sea or fresh water in lake continued water can have excellent optical quality with long scattering length that can lead to very good angular resolution the decay of radioactive potassium typically contributes steady khz background rate in in photomultiplier tube pmt bioluminescence also contributes bursts of background light that result in detector dead time currents are also an issue it is necessary to track the position of the optical sensors in contrast antarctic ice has shorter scattering length than water but the attenuation length is longer with appropriate reconstruction algorithms it is possible to place the optical sensors farther apart in ice than in water furthermore the only background in the sterile ice is that introduced by the detector itself as has already been mentioned the original effort to build large detector was by the dumand collaboration they proposed to build substantial deep ocean detector at site about km off the coast of the island of hawaii in of water buoyant strings of pmts were to be anchored to the seabed and connected to the shore by an underwater cable the challenges were formidable for the technology high pressures corrosive salt water and large backgrounds from bioluminescence and radioactive dumand was canceled after pressure vessel leaked during the very first string deployment another effort by russian and german collaboration in lake baikal in siberia is still taking data taking advantage of the deep pure water the detector was built in stages starting with optical modules the current main detector consists of phototubes on eight strings later extension added three sparse strings from the main detector providing an instrumented mass of mtons for extremely high energy cascades the ice that covers lake baikal for two months every spring is convenient platform for detector construction and repair after extensive research and development efforts by the antares astronomy with neutrino telescope and abyss environmental research nestor neutrino extended submarine telescope with oceanographic research and nemo neutrino mediterranean observatory collaborations in the mediterranean there is optimism that the technological challenges to building neutrino telescopes in deep seawater have now been met construction of the antares detector located at depth of close to the shore near toulon france has been completed the detector consists of strings each equipped with optical sensors mounted in triplets antares performance has been verified by the first observation of atmospheric neutrinos like amanda it is proof of concept for km net cubic kilometer neutrino telescope kilometer scale detector in the mediterranean sea complementary to icecube at the south pole neutrino astronomy predates kilometer scale detectors the first searches for extraterrestrial neutrinos were in the in two deep mines india kolar gold field and south africa east rand mine because of the large background radiation at ground level from cosmic rays interacting in the atmosphere neutrino detectors must be underground both experiments used scintillation detectors few meters on each side to detect handful of upward going muons from atmospheric neutrinos by davis geochemical experiment was detecting few argon atoms day produced when solar neutrinos interacted in an underground tank filled with perchloroethylene by the late scintillation detectors had evolved into the long by wide by high macro monopole astrophysics and cosmic ray observatory detector in the gran sasso underground laboratory in italy macro consisted of passive absorber interspersed with streamer tubes and surrounded by long tanks containing liquid scintillator macro observed over neutrinos over the course of yr in similar period the frejus experiment measured the atmospheric spectrum and set limit on tev extraterrestrial neutrinos however further growth required new technique first suggested by markov in detecting charged particles by the cherenkov radiation emitted in water or ice cherenkov light is radiated by charged particles moving faster than the speed of light in the medium in ice this is of the speed of light in vacuum the emission is akin to sonic boom pmts detect this blue and near uv light with sufficient density of pmts neutrinos with energies of only few mev may be reconstructed the water cherenkov technique was pioneered in kiloton sized detectors optimized for relatively low energy gev neutrinos the two most successful first generation detectors were the irvine michigan brookhaven and kamiokande detectors both consisted of tanks containing thousands of tons of purified water monitored with thousands of pmts on the top and sides of the tank although optimized for gev energies these detectors were also sensitive to lower energy neutrinos imb ref and kamiokande launched neutrino astronomy by detecting some low energy mev neutrino events from supernova their success as well as the accumulating evidence for the solar neutrino puzzle stimulated the development of two second generation detectors super kamiokande is ton scaled up version of kamiokande and the sudbury neutrino observatory sno is ton heavy water o based detector together the two experiments clearly showed that neutrinos have mass by observing flavor oscillations between and in the solar and atmospheric neutrino beams thus providing the first evidence for physics beyond the standard model these experiments showed that at gev energies atmospheric neutrinos were major background to searches for nonthermal astronomical sources where particles g the observed cosmic rays are accelerated the spectrum of cosmic neutrinos from these sources extends to energies beyond those characteristics of atmospheric neutrinos future experiments would require kilometer scale volumes and would target higher energies where the background is lower although super kamiokande continues to collect data there is considerable interest in building much larger megaton detectors to pursue these physics studies with higher sensitivity in summary the field has already achieved spectacular success neutrino detectors have seen the sun and detected supernova in the large magellanic cloud in both observations were of tremendous importance the former showed that neutrinos have tiny mass opening the first crack in the standard model of particle physics and the latter confirmed the theory of stellar evolution as well as the basic nuclear physics of the death of stars figure illustrates the cosmic neutrino energy spectrum covering an enormous range from microwave energies ev to ev the figure is mixture of observations and theoretical predictions at low energy the neutrino sky is dominated by neutrinos produced in the big bang at mev energy neutrinos are produced by supernova explosions the flux from the event is shown the figure displays the measured atmospheric neutrino flux up to energies of tev by the amanda experiment atmospheric neutrinos are key to our story because they are the dominant background for extraterrestrial searches the flux of atmospheric neutrinos falls dramatically with increasing energy events above tev are rare leaving clear field of view for extraterrestrial sources the highest energy neutrinos in fig are the decay products of pions produced by the interactions of cosmic rays with microwave photons above threshold of ev cosmic rays interact with the microwave background introducing an absorption feature in the cosmic ray flux the greissen zatsepin kuzmin gzk cutoff as consequence the mean free path of extragalactic cosmic rays propagating in the microwave background is limited to roughly mpc light years and therefore the secondary neutrinos are the only probe of the still enigmatic sources at longer distances what they will reveal is matter of speculation the calculation of the neutrino flux associated with the observed flux of extragalactic cosmic rays is straightforward and yields one event per year in kilometer scale detector it is however subject to ambiguities most notably from the still unknown composition of the highest energy cosmic rays and due to the cosmological evolution of the sources the flux labeled gzk in fig shares the high energy neutrino sky with neutrinos from gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei in this review we will first illustrate the origin of the concept to build kilometer scale neutrino detector it has taken half century from the concept to the commissioning of icecube it took this long to develop the methodologies and technologies to build neutrino telescope we will describe them next we complete the article by discussing other science covered by this novel instrument why kilometer scale detectors neutrino sources and cosmic cosmic ray accelerators and cosmic beam despite discovery potential touching wide range of scientific issues the construction of icecube and future km net ref has been largely motivated by the possibility of opening new window on the universe using neutrinos as cosmic messengers specifically we will revisit icecube prospects to detect cosmic neutrinos associated with cosmic rays and thus finally reveal their sources cosmic accelerators produce particles with energies in excess of tev we still do not know where or how the observed flux of cosmic rays is shown in fig the energy spectrum follows sequence of three power laws the first two are separated by feature dubbed the knee at an energy of approximately tev there is evidence that cosmic rays up to this energy are galactic in origin any association with our galaxy disappears in the vicinity of second feature in the spectrum referred to as the ankle see fig above the ankle the gyroradius of proton in the galactic magnetic field exceeds the size of the galaxy and points to the onset of an extragalactic component in the spectrum that extends to energies beyond tev direct support for this assumption comes from two experiments that have observed the telltale structure in the cosmic ray spectrum resulting from the absorption of the particle flux by the microwave background the so called gzk cutoff the origin of the flux in the intermediate region remains mystery although it is routinely assumed that it results from some high energy extension of the reach of galactic accelerators acceleration of protons or nuclei to tev energy and above likely requires massive bulk flows of relativistic charged particles these are likely to originate from exceptional gravitational forces in the vicinity of black holes or neutron stars gravity powers large currents of charged particles that produce high magnetic fields these fields create the opportunity for particle acceleration by shocks similar to what happens with solar flares it is fact that electrons are accelerated to tev energy and above near black holes astronomers detect them indirectly by their synchrotron radiation some must accelerate protons because we observe them as cosmic rays how many gamma rays and neutrinos are produced in association with the cosmic ray beam generically cosmic ray source should also be beam dump cosmic rays accelerated in regions of high magnetic fields near black holes inevitably interact with radiation surrounding them for instance uv photons in active galaxies or mev photons in gamma ray burst fireballs neutral and charged pion secondaries are produced by the processesp and n although secondary protons may remain trapped in the high magnetic fields neutrons and the pion decay products escape the energy escaping the source is distributed among cosmic rays gamma rays and neutrinos produced by the decay of neutrons neutral pions and charged pions respectively kilometer scale neutrino detectors have the sensitivity to reveal generic cosmic ray sources with an energy density in neutrinos comparable to their energy density in cosmic rays and pionic tev photons in the case of galactic supernova shocks cosmic rays interact with gas in the galactic disk g with dense molecular clouds producing equal numbers of pions of all three charges in hadronic collisions p x here is the multiplicity of secondary pions this mechanism predicts relation between cosmic ray np gamma ray and neutrino fluxes dn de dn de dn de nintx dnpdep epx the first relation reflects the fact that pions decay into gamma rays and neutrinos that carry and of the energy of the parent this assumes that the four leptons in the decay e equally share the charged pion energy n e is the sum of the neutrino and antineutrino fluxes that are not distinguished by the experiments oscillations over cosmic baselines yield approximately equal fluxes for the three flavors the two factors apply to the hadronic and photoproduction of pions in the source respectively although this relation only depends on straightforward particle physics the second relation of the neutrino to the actual cosmic ray flux depends on nint the number of interactions determined by the optical depth of the source for interactions the factorx ep xp is the relative energy of the neutrino to the pion the pion carries on average fraction xp of the parent proton energy and shares it roughly equally between the four leptons these relations form the basis for testing the assumption that cosmic rays are accelerated in cosmic source for more detailed discussion of these relations we refer the reader to ref this discussion does not apply to sources that primarily accelerate electrons which do not produce neutrinos some cosmic electron accelerators have been identified via their emission of polarized synchrotron radiation however unambiguously identifying source that does not emit synchrotron radiation is challenging and unambiguous observation of cosmic ray accelerator may require the observation of neutrinos galactic supernova remnants were proposed as the source of galactic cosmic rays as early as by baade and zwicky their proposal is still matter of debate galactic cosmic rays reach energies of at least several thousand tev the knee in the spectrum their interactions with galactic hydrogen in the vicinity of the accelerator should generate gamma rays from the decay of secondary pions that reach energies of hundreds of tev such sources should be identifiable by relatively flat energy spectrum that extends to high energy without attenuation they have been dubbed pevatrons straightforward energetics arguments show that present air cherenkov telescopes should have the sensitivity necessary to detect tev photons from pevatrons they may have been revealed by an all sky survey in tev gamma rays with the milagro detector sources are identified in nearby star forming regions in cygnus and in the vicinity of galactic latitude some are not readily associated with known supernova remnants or with nonthermal sources observed at other wavelengths in fact some milagro sources may actually be molecular clouds illuminated by the cosmic ray beam accelerated in young remnants located within pc one expects indeed that the highest energy cosmic rays are accelerated over short time period of the order of yr when the shock velocity is high the high energy particles can produce photons and neutrinos over much longer periods when they diffuse through the interstellar medium to interact with nearby molecular clouds star forming regions provide all ingredients for the efficient production of neutrinos supernovae to accelerate cosmic rays and high density ambient medium including molecular clouds as an efficient target for producing pions despite the rapid development of more sensitive instruments it has been impossible to conclusively pinpoint supernova remnants as sources of cosmic rays by identifying gamma rays of pion origin eliminating the possibility of purely electromagnetic origin of tev gamma rays is challenging detecting the accompanying neutrinos would provide incontrovertible evidence for cosmic ray acceleration in the sources particle physics dictates the relation between gamma rays and neutrinos and basically predicts the production of pair for every two gamma rays seen by milagro see eq this follows from the assumptions that gamma rays and neutrinos originate indeed from pions produced in equal numbers for each of the three charges in the collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar matter for average values of the parameters describing the flux the completed icecube detector could confirm the sources in the milagro sky map as sites of cosmic ray acceleration at the level in less than yr and at the level in yr refs and see also fig sources of extragalactic cosmic although there is no direct evidence that supernovae accelerate cosmic rays the idea is generally accepted because of energetics three supernovae per century converting reasonable fraction of solar mass into particle acceleration can accommodate the steady flux of cosmic rays in the galaxy energetics also drives speculation on the origin of extragalactic cosmic rays the energy density of these rays in the universe is erg cm it can be accommodated with the reasonable assumption that shocks in the expanding gamma ray burst grb fireball convert similar energy into the acceleration of protons that are observed as cosmic rays it so happens that ergs per grb will yield the observed energy density in cosmic rays after yr given that their rate is gpc yr therefore grbs per year over hubble time produce the observed cosmic ray energy density in the universe just as three supernovae per century accommodate the steady flux of cosmic rays in the galaxy cosmic rays and synchrotron photons coexist in the expanding grb fireball prior to it reaching transparency and producing the observed grb display their interactions produce charged pions and neutrinos with flux that can be estimated from the observed extragalactic cosmic ray flux see eq fireball phenomenology predicts that on average nint problem solved not really the energy density of extragalactic cosmic rays can also be accommodated by active galactic nuclei provided each converts ergs into particle acceleration as with grbs this is an amount that matches their output in electromagnetic radiation waxman and bahcall argued that it is implausible that the neutrino flux should exceed the cosmic ray fluxe dnde tev cm sr for the specific example of grb we have to scale it downward by factor see eq after years of operation amanda sensitivity is approaching the interesting range but it takes icecube to explore it if grbs are the sources and the flux is near this limit then icecube mission is relatively straightforward because we expect to observe of the order of neutrinos km yr in coincidence with grbs observed by the swift and fermi satellites which translates to observation similar statistical power can be obtained by detecting showers produced by and in summary while the road to identification of sources of the galactic cosmic ray has been mapped the origin of the extragalactic component remains unresolved hopefully neutrinos will reveal the sources neutrino because of the small neutrino cross sections very large detector is required to observe astrophysical neutrinos at the same time flavor identification is also very desirable since the background from atmospheric neutrinos is much lower for and than that for of course angular resolution is also very important for detecting point sources and energy resolution is important in determining neutrino energy spectra which is important for identifying diffuse flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos icecube detects neutrinos by observing the cherenkov radiation from the charged particles produced by neutrino interactions charge current interactions produce lepton which carries an average of for gev to at high energies of the neutrino energy the remainder of the energy is transferred to the nuclear target the latter is released in the form of hadronic shower both the produced lepton and the hadronic shower produce cherenkov radiation in neutral current interactions the neutrino transfers fraction of its energy to nuclear target producing just hadronic shower icecube can differentiate neutrino interactions on the basis of their topology as shown in fig at low energies there are two basic topologies tracks from and cascades from and all flavor neutral current interactions charge current cascades include contributions from the shower from the electron or tau decay products plus the hadronic shower from the struck nucleus the contributions are inseparable at pev energies muon tracks can be up to km long while on the scale of icecube cascades are nearly point sources at higher pev energies an additional topology arises this is the double bang whereby interacts and the energy transferred to the target nucleus produces one cascade the travels some hundreds of meters and decays producing second cascade the different topologies each have advantages and disadvantages the long lever arm from tracks from decay allows the muon direction and from that the neutrino direction to be determined accurately as will be seen icecube angular resolution is better than for long tracks one can produce sky maps and search them for hot spots this is obviously the key in finding neutrino sources the disadvantages are that there is large background of atmospheric and that because the events are not contained it is difficult to determine the neutrino energy however and interactions also have some significant advantages they are detected in both the northern and southern hemispheres this is also true for with energy above pev where the background from the steeply falling atmospheric spectrum becomes negligible icecube sensitivity to the galactic center is similar to that of antares although not to that of kilometer scale detector in the northern hemisphere the background of atmospheric is significantly lower and there are almost no atmospheric at higher energies muons from decay the source of atmospheric no longer decay and the relatively rare decays become the dominant source of background the neutrino energy may be more precisely determined since the events are contained the energy measurement is largely calorimetric because the light output scales nearly linearly with the cascade energy their energy measurement is superior one can use energy spectra to differentiate between atmospheric and extraterrestrial neutrinos the latter has harder spectrum tau neutrinos are not absorbed by the earth instead interacting in the earth produce secondary of lower energy either directly in neutral current interaction or via the decay of tau lepton produced in charged current interaction high energy will thus cascade down to hundreds of tev energy where the earth is transparent in other words they are detected with reduced energy but are not absorbed although cascades are nearly pointlike they are not isotropic light is preferentially emitted at the cherenkov angle about in ice although this light is heavily scattered before reaching the optical sensors at energies above tev enough directional information may remain to determine the neutrino direction to about see ref the light produced by cascades spreads over large volume in icecube tev cascade is visible within radius of about rising to at eev e the shower radius grows by just over decade in energy at energies above pev in ice electrons and photons can interact with multiple atoms and the landau pomeranchuk migdal effect reduces the cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production at energies above pev electromagnetic showers begin to elongate reaching length of about at eev at these energies the shower direction might be better determined at energies above pev photonuclear interactions must be considered and even electromagnetic showers will have hadronic component including some muon production the detection of neutrinos of all flavors is important in separating diffuse extraterrestrial neutrinos from atmospheric neutrinos generic cosmic accelerators produce neutrinos from the decay of pions with admixture over cosmic baselines neutrino oscillations alter the ratio to because approximately one half of the converts into the same production ratio is expected for lower energy below gev atmospheric neutrinos where the muons can decay before interacting however at higher energies the muons interact and atmospheric neutrinos are largely the flavor ratio depends on the distance the neutrinos have traveled extraterrestrial neutrinos should have comparable fluxes of and for in depth discussion of neutrino detection energy measurement and flavor separation and for detailed references see the icecube preliminary design document and ref to first approximation neutrinos are detected when they interact inside the instrumented volume the path length traversed within the detector volume by neutrino with zenith angle is determined by the detector geometry to first approximation neutrinos are detected if they interact within the detector volume e within the instrumented distance that probability isp exp e e where icena e is the mean free path in ice for neutrino

cross sectional area e facing the incident beam will producenev e tha p dnde de events after time one must additionally account for the fact that neutrinos may not reach the detector because they are absorbed in the earth when they travel along chord of length at zenith angle this absorption factor depends on neutrino flavor and must also be included in the probability e that the neutrino is detected event rate calculations are discussed in more detail in the appendix of ref so far the formalism applies to contained events e we assumed that the neutrino interacted within the instrumented distance furthermore the effective detector area e is clearly also function of zenith angle it is not strictly equal to the geometric cross section of the instrumented volume facing the incoming neutrino because even neutrinos interacting outside the instrumented volume may produce enough light inside the detector to be detected in practice e is determined as function of the incident neutrino direction and zenith angle by full detector simulation including the trigger it is of the order of km for icecube often the neutrino effective area is introduced as ap note that the quantity is calculated rather than measured and is different for muon and tau flavors we generalize it next for muon neutrinos any neutrino producing secondary muon that reaches the detector and has sufficient energy to trigger it will be detected see fig because the muon travels kilometers at tev energy and tens of kilometers at pev energy neutrinos can be detected outside the instrumented volume the probability is obtained by substitution in eq therefore here is the range of the muon determined by its energy loss tau neutrino can be observed provided the tau lepton it produces reaches the instrumented volume within its lifetime in eq is replaced byl e c where and are the mass lifetime and energy of the tau respectively the tau decay length m gev grows linearly with energy and exceeds the range of the muon near ev at even higher energies the tau eventually ranges out by catastrophic interactions just like the muon despite the reduction of the cross sections by factor m the taus trigger the detector but the tracks and or showers they produce are mostly indistinguishable from those initiated by muon and electron neutrinos see also fig to be clearly recognizable as both the initial neutrino interaction and the subsequent tau decay must be contained within the detector for cubic kilometer detector this happens for neutrinos with energies from few pev to few tens of pev it might be possible to identify that only interact in the detector or that decay in the detector but this has not yet been proven muon muons from have ranges from kilometers at tev energy to tens of kilometers at eev energy generating showers along their track by bremsstrahlung pair production and photonuclear interactions these are the sources of additional cherenkov radiation because the energy of the muon degrades along its track the energy of secondary showers also gradually diminishes and the distance from the track over which the associated cherenkov light can trigger pmt is gradually reduced the geometry of the light pool surrounding the muon track is therefore kilometer long cone with gradually decreasing radius at lower energies of hundreds of gev and less the muon becomes minimum ionizing in its first kilometer high energy muon typically loses energy in couple of showers of one tenth of its initial energy so the initial radius of the cone is the radius of shower with of the muon energy g for tev muon near the end of its range the muon becomes minimum ionizing visible up to about from the pmt figure shows the detection distance as function of the photoelectron threshold because of the stochastic nature of the muon energy loss the relationship between the observed via cherenkov light energy loss and the muon energy varies from muon to muon the muon energy in the detector can be determined to roughly factor of beyond that one does not know how far the muon traveled and how much energy it lost before entering the detector an unfolding process is required to determine the neutrino energy based on the observed muon energies from amanda to icecube natural antarctic ice neutrino detection in ice was pioneered by the amanda collaboration in the late it requires thick ice sheet so amanda was built in the thick icecap at the amundsen scott south pole station the collaboration drilled holes in the ice using hot water drill and lowered strings of optical sensors before the water in the hole refroze the station provided everything from skiway for the lc turboprops that carried every piece of equipment plus all of the fuel to radio and internet communication and to food and housing for the summer construction crew and the two or three winter over scientists who kept amanda running in the winter despite the logistical difficulties the collaboration lowered photomultipliers in pressure vessels into kilometer deep hole during the season austral summer although most of the sensors survived the unexpectedly high pressures produced as the water in the hole froze cosmic ray muon tracks could not be seen the problem was diameter air bubbles trapped in the ice even at km depth these bubbles limited the light scattering length to less than cm fortunately it was predicted that near depth of high pressure would cause the bubbles to collapse data confirmed this and blue light was measured to have an incredibly long absorption length of more than reflecting the purity of the ice with this understood four strings of detectors were deployed at depths between and in the season the next challenge was to separate single upward going muon from the roughly downward going muons from cosmic ray air showers algorithms with the required rejection power were developed for this and neutrino events were identified by the amanda detector was complete with strings and optical sensors later upgrade replaced the time to digital conversion amplitude to digital converters tdc adc electronics with waveform digitizers since amanda ii has been recording about neutrino events per year for the past few years it operated in coincidence with icecube despite this success amanda limitations were becoming obvious it was too small and it required manpower intensive annual calibrations the amanda optical modules oms contained in photomultiplier tubes and little else analog pmt signals were transmitted to the surface although several different approaches were tried over the years the analog transmission of signals to the surface degraded the resolution initially amanda used coaxial cables and then twisted pairs which transmitted high voltage for the pmt downward and pmt signals upward the up to cables stretched the nanosecond pmt rise time to microseconds at the surface although careful signal processing could provide adequate ns first hit time resolution there was no possibility to observe multiple hits the long unamplified transmission required the pmts to be run at very high gain near this had deleterious effects on the pmts and few of them would occasionally spark emitting light in the process in later strings the electrical transmission was replaced with analog optical transmission the pmt signal controlled light emitting diode led in the optical module the fibers had far better time resolution but suffered from very limited dynamic range the light loss in the optical couplings was very sensitive to vibration and the passage of time so the system required manpower intensive annual recalibrations these problems precluded scaling amanda up in size and the collaboration began exploring other options the most attractive but technically challenging option was to incorporate the digitizing electronics in each optical module as test amanda string included prototype in om digitizers these digitizers ran in parallel with fiber optic analog transmission allowing for both electronics testing and compatibility with amanda string performed well and the in om digitization was adopted by icecube icecube shares many characteristics with its predecessors as fig shows it is large tracking calorimeter that measures the energy deposition in segmented volumes of antarctic ice because of its size icecube can differentiate between electron muon and tau neutrino interactions it has very good timing resolution which is used to both accurately reconstruct muon trajectories and to find the vertices of contained events icecube is fairly complex experiment table lists and defines some of the icecube specific acronyms that are used in this review when it is completed in digital optical modules doms will instrument km of antarctic ice eighty six vertical strings each containing doms will be deployed in deep holes that were drilled in the ice by hot water drill the water in the hole will refreeze producing optical contact between pmts and ice the strings in the baseline icecube design will be deployed on m grid covering km of the surface doms are attached to the strings every between and although the minimum energy is analysis dependent the baseline design detects muon neutrinos down to an energy of about gev each string of doms is supported by cable that contains twisted pairs each pair is connected to two doms in parallel plus strength member and protective covering these cables run to counting house at the center of the array another six strings called deepcore are situated on denser triangular grid the deepcore strings have doms with spacing at the bottom of the strings ten doms higher up serve as veto deepcore extends icecube sensitivity down by factor of in energy the outer icecube strings and top doms in deepcore will serve to veto events originating outside the central detector greatly reducing the backgrounds for contained events deepcore uses newer pmts with higher quantum efficiency than the icecube standard the denser spacing and more efficient pmts give deepcore lower threshold than icecube perhaps as low as gev in addition to the buried doms the icecube observatory includes surface air shower array known as icetop icetop consists of ice filled tanks each instrumented with two icecube doms two tanks are deployed about apart near the top of each baseline icecube string each tank is in diameter and filled with ice to depth of about cm the water is frozen in controlled manner to minimize air bubbles the tanks are lined with reflective material to increase light collection depending on tank there are small design differences as production proceeded typical vertical muon produces observed photoelectrons the two doms operate at different gains and to maximize the tank dynamic range because of the higher data rates each icetop dom has its own twisted pair icetop detects cosmic ray air showers with threshold of about tev icetop will be used to study the cosmic ray flux and composition the combination of air shower array data and tev muon fluxes observed by icecube provides significant handles on the cosmic ray composition icetop also serves several calibration functions for icecube icetop can also be used to veto high energy cosmic ray air showers in icecube conversely one can search for muon free showers from pev photons icecube was designed for simple deployment calibration and operation photomultiplier signals are recorded using fast waveform digitizers in each dom every dom acts autonomously receiving power control and calibration signals from the surface and returning digital data packets icecube construction began in the season with the first string deployment by january of the total including deepcore strings had been deployed and the array should be complete by january the construction at the south pole is difficult and logistics are tough the construction season is short from mid october through mid february and being able to drill holes and deploy strings quickly is critical in order to be able to build icecube in seven seasons holes had to be drilled in less than days requiring power plant of close to mw to melt ice specialized equipment was designed for this effort getting the roughly lb of drilling equipment to the south pole was another major challenge the drilling equipment had to be built in modular form with each component able to fit into lc transport plane because of the high altitude the plane payload is limited further straining the logistics chain icecube doms are deployed in water filled holes cm in diameter the water at the edges of these holes begins to refreeze almost immediately their cm diameter ensures that the holes remain open wide enough to accommodate the cable and doms for this allows full string deployment the ice is melted by hot water jet under pressure from nozzle supplying gal min at mpa and temperature of the water is subsequently pumped out of the hole and returned to heating system at rate of min and temperature of the water is reheated at the surface and returned to the nozzle at depth drilling progresses by circulating this water reheated at the surface to ever increasing depth also min is added to the loop at to compensate for volume reduction when the ice becomes water the operation requires heating plant generating mw in thermal and kw in electrical energy it can drill holes in less than ref using less than of fuel per hole figure shows photo of the drill head in operation the system has many components this summary traces the chain of operations that delivers hole filled with water of sufficient width and depth to deploy string of optical sensors the firn drill an independent kw electrically heated glycol loop powered by generator that melts holes through the top layer of about of snow that is porous to water the rodriguez well formed each season by operating hot water drill at fixed depth thus creating cavity of water this water is used to initiate drilling and to supply the replacement water previously mentioned the preheat system car wash style heaters and stinger heaters bring water sequentially to and in two tanks the main heating plant consists of high efficiency car wash style heaters that deliver water to the drill head at depending on depth high pressure pumps four units provide min flow under nominal pressure of mpa the drill supply hose reel contains of hose on motorized reel with level wind and brake to supply hot water to the drill head the hose

more than input output points the pump returns the water from the hole to the first surface tank at for reheating to thus closing the loop the fuel tanks and all drill components are built on movable sleds to allow for repositioning the drilling infrastructure every new season the drill speed is computer controlled the actual width and refreeze time of each hole are accurately computed on the basis of drill data entered into the software in the season the system delivered holes with performance far superior to design holes were drilled in less than with fuel consumption of just over greatly improving upon design goals before the water in the hole refreezes cable is lowered into the hole that will carry the signal to the surface from the doms attached every in situ construction of the string and lowering it to depth takes roughly each string takes data as soon as the hole refreezes the ice the ice surrounding the doms serves as cherenkov radiator optical absorption and scattering of the radiated photons are both important in determining what icecube observes the optical transmission depends strongly on impurities in the ice these impurities were introduced when the ice was first laid down as snow this happens in layers each year snowfall produced thin nearly horizontal layer for the ice in icecube this happened over roughly the last yr variations in the long term dust level in the atmosphere during this period as well as the occasional volcanic eruption lead to depth dependent variations in the absorption and scattering lengths because the bulk of the scattering is in the forward region light scattering in ice is usually parametrized in terms of the effective scattering length eff scat cos where is the mean scattering angle per scatter eff is of course frequency dependent much effort has gone into measuring the optical properties of the ice using artificial light sources and in situ measurements in amanda and icecube studies have been done using leds and lasers that emit at variety of wavelengths the amanda data are still valuable because they involve measurements at many wavelengths by measuring the arrival time distributions of photons at different distances from light source it is possible to measure both the attenuation length and scattering length of the light these measurements although useful suffer from limited resolution in depth higher resolution depth dependence measurements of the ice properties come from dust loggers which are lowered down water filled holes immediately after drilling they shine thin beam of light into the ice and measure the reflected light this can measure the ice properties with vertical resolution given by the width of the emitted beam few millimeters figure compares some of the dust logger data with optical scattering measurements and with ice cores collected elsewhere in antarctica figure shows the absorption and scattering distances currently used in icecube as function of depth and wavelength these curves are based on theoretical models fit to the amanda and icecube measurements the effect of air bubbles at shallower depths is clearly visible along with broad dust peaks and the native absorption in the ice not visible are the very narrow peaks due to thin layers of dust produced by volcanoes the doms had rather stringent design requirements they had to record the arrival times of most of the photoelectrons observed by the photomultiplier tube with timing resolution across the array icetop spread of up to km of less than ns the dynamic range requirement was photoelectrons ns the pmts also had to have dark noise rate less than hz this in turn set limits on the radioactivity in the pressure vessel and on the pmt doms had to work from room temperature for testing down to because of the high cost of power fuel for the generator must be flown in on lc each dom was required to draw less than finally because the doms are totally inaccessible after deployment we set reliability requirement of dom survival after yr this is the same reliability as is expected for satellites but on much lower budget figure is schematic diagram of digital optical module each dom consists of in cm photomultiplier tube and associated electronics plus data acquisition system all in cm diameter pressure sphere the pmt electronics include cockroft walton high voltage power supply and resistive divider the doms also contain light emitting diodes used for photonic calibrations the pressure vessel is in thick borosilicate glass sphere capable of withstanding pressure of mpa the glass transmits light with wavelength longer than about nm limiting the high frequency response of the dom radioactive decays in the glass are significant contributor to the pmt dark noise the resulting fluorescence in the glass produces time correlated background in the pmt out to times of few microseconds the pmts are optically coupled to the pressure vessel using optical coupling gel the sphere is filled with nitrogen gas at atm pressure the photomultiplier the baseline icecube and icetop doms use hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes these tubes have standard bialkali sb rb cs and sb cs photocathodes sensitive to nm photons with peak quantum efficiency the amplifying section has ten linear focused dynodes and runs at gain of at nominal most of the pmts are run at gain of the typical high voltages range from to a mu metal shield surrounds the pmt and reduces the ambient earth magnetic field in the pmt by about factor of the pmt bases are conventional resistive dividers with the hamamatsu recommended ratios and total resistance of high resistances were used to minimize power consumption capacitors are placed across the last six dynode stages to maintain the voltages in the presence of large pulses their recharging time constants are of the order of the capacitors are sized so that the pmt loses less than gain for photoelectron pulse the high voltage hv is supplied by custom designed cockroft walton power supply it is both low power mw and low noise mv the output voltage is digitally controlled and may be adjusted from the surface the pmts operate with the cathode grounded the anodes are at high potential the anode signals are coupled to the data acquisition electronics with bifilar wound toroidal transformer transformer was used instead of capacitor because it has much lower stored energy for an equivalent frequency response the transformers were designed to have frequency response from khz to over mhz down to a square wave input produces an output signal with decay time of more than far longer than the lengths of single event except for possible slow magnetic monopoles the first doms were built with an earlier design with s time constant during data analysis this droop is removed with digital filter the only problem occurs when the adcs overflow or bottom out in which case some information is lost the system response to single photoelectron spe is pulse with roughly triangular waveforms with an average amplitude of about mv and width of ns figure shows the charge spectrum produced by the pmt running at gain of in response to low amplitude led emitting much less than photoelectron pulse the single photoelectron peak is described by gaussian with resolution of about however about of the spe produce much smaller output less than of the peak charge this low charge tail is from real spe figure shows the arrival times of single photoelectron pulses for single photoelectrons the time resolution is about ns although tail of late arriving pulses is clearly visible with peaks around and ns late about of the pulses come more than ns after the expected arrival time the timing is slightly sensitive to where the photoelectrons hit the photocathode photons striking the edges of the pmt are recorded on average about ns later than those reaching the center their time resolution is also worse since nearby neutrino interactions can produce large signals in the icecube doms the pmt response to large signals was well characterized figure shows the signals produced by light pulses containing about and photoelectrons saturation is clearly visible for the two larger signals and the pmt output is no longer linear the saturation appears to be an instantaneous effect and can be corrected solely modifying the pmt current without reference to the previous history of the pulse the corrected current is found from the measured current usingi ln c ia ia where b and are constants that vary significantly from pmt to pmt they also depend on the pmt gain figure shows block diagram of the daq system and fig shows photo of the main board the central elements of the daq hardware are two waveform digitization systems the analog transient waveform digitizer atwd and the fadc fast adc digitization cycle is initiated by discriminator trigger the voltage threshold corresponds to about photoelectron when the discriminator fires the field programmable gate array fpga starts atwd and fadc digitization synchronously on the next clock edge ns long delay line is used to delay the signal to the atwds so that the pmt pulse appears near the beginning of the digitization cycle to maximize reliability this delay line is implemented on separate printed circuit pc board containing long winding trace this approach limits the delay line bandwidth to about mhz the amplifiers that feed the atwd chips also have about mhz of the bandwidth the atwd digitizer is custom complementary metal oxide semiconductor analog integrated circuit containing switched capacitor array sca each channel contains an array of capacitors connected to the input via set of switches which are normally open when an acquisition cycle is launched the switch to each capacitor is closed in turn the switches are controlled by an adjustable delay line by varying control voltage sampling rates between and msamples are possible icecube runs the atwds at msamples the atwd chip consumes about mw far less than any comparable commercial digitizer each atwd chip has four parallel inputs three atwd channels connect to the pmt signal with input gains in the ratio of providing more than bits of dynamic range after acquisition the voltages on the capacitors are digitized with bit wilkinson adcs each multiplexed to the four capacitors which acquire single time sample the fourth atwd input not shown is used for electronics calibrations digitization takes per waveform the analog performance of the chips is ample for icecube the analog bandwidth of the sampling circuitry is higher than mhz higher than the circuitry that precedes it the analog dynamic range of is higher than for the bit outputs however some effort is required to calibrate the data the relationship between control voltage and sampling rate varies from chip to chip in icecube the fourth atwd channel digitizes the mhz clock from this the sampling rate is determined each capacitor has its own pedestal value the pedestals from single chip must be determined individually and stored each dom contains two atwd chips they operate in ping pong fashion while one is digitizing the other is live this greatly reduces the dead time the fadc digitizer system uses continuously running commercial bit msamples digitizer chip that runs continuously it is preceded by three stage shaping amplifier which lengthens the pmt pulses with ns shaping time to better match the sample time since the pulse covers multiple samples it is possible to determine the photon arrival time to better than ns when trigger occurs the system records fadc samples covering the fadc suffers from limited dynamic range it overflows for even medium sized signals however for smaller signals it can provide important information about late arriving light the data from single trigger launch in icecube parlance consist of at least one atwd waveform and one fadc waveform plus time stamp and the local coincidence signals from the adjacent doms the highest gain atwd waveform data are always saved if any single bin of that waveform is above adc counts then the medium gain channel is also read out if any bin of the medium gain channel is above counts then the low gain channel is also saved to reduce bandwidth the waveforms are compressed using delta compression each sample except the first is replaced with the difference from the previous sample these are mostly small numbers then these deltas are stored using variable width symbols the time stamp comes from the mhz system clock showing when the dom launched since this determines the arrival time of every photon in the event accuracy is crucial and precision oscillator is used power limitations precluded the use of an oven controlled oscillator but fortunately the temperature is very stable the system uses an oscillator with frequency stability allen variance of better than f adequate to maintain the required ns precision over tens of seconds this sets the required interval between timing calibrations as discussed below the entire system is controlled by k gate altera excalibur epxa fpga which incorporates an arm hard core cpu the fpga controls the trigger and digitizer buffers and zero suppresses the data and does most of the packet assembly while the cpu performs higher level tasks including some calibration work one challenge for this system was to ensure that the firmware and software were upgradable while at the same time making sure that bad load could not cause permanent loss of communication for this the fpga uses two programming sources on power on the fpga boots from one time programmable mbit configuration memory that provides basic functionality such as communications and simple utility program this memory cannot be altered however to allow for reprogramming it can then be directed to switch its programming using data from an mbit flash memory which can be reprogrammed from the surface few functions that cannot be implemented in the fpga are performed by complex programmable logic device cpld this cpld retains its logic configuration even without power it controls the fpga configuration cycle and the interface to the flasher board reads adc channels used for monitoring and controls dac channels that provide analog control voltages figure shows the digital interconnections on the main board the fpga includes bit scalar which counts the number of pmt pulses in each ms period the scalar readings are stored in memory and read out periodically they are used to search for bursts of neutrinos due to supernova as discussed in sec data from two doms are transmitted to the surface via single twisted pair which also provides vdc total power each dom consumes about the signals are transmitted using an bit dac and received with bit adc both run at msamples this is overkill for the kbit data communication rate using amplitude shift modulation but is important for the rapcal timing calibration described below higher rates would be possible using more sophisticated protocols but they are not needed the cable incorporates local coincidence circuitry whereby doms communicate with their nearest neighbors they can also pass messages onward icecube doms have several operating modes for the local coincidence circuitry until early icecube ran in hard local coincidence hlc mode in this mode the doms only saved data when two nearest neighbor or next to nearest neighbor doms saw signal within s coincidence window when this happened the entire waveform information was sent to the surface the hlc hit rate depends on dom depth through both the muon flux and the optical properties of the ice but is typically hz the noise rate for hlc hits is very low in early icecube started taking data in soft local coincidence slc mode in addition to the complete waveform data for coincident hits coarse charge stamp was sent to the surface for isolated hits these charge stamps contains three fadc samples the highest samples out of the first along with the time of the highest sample slc hits are recorded at the pmt dark rate typically hz although most of these hits are noise they are useful in many analyses especially when preliminary reconstruction can be used to restrict the active time and volume for slc hits one other critical requirement for icecube hardware is reliability once deployed it is impossible to repair dom so the system demanded very high reliability several measures were taken to assure this high reliability parts were used where possible and all were heavily derated the pc board was laid out with conservative design rules and was constructed from high temperature fr chosen because of its lower temperature coefficient finally the boards and completed doms were subject to stringent testing prototype boards were subject to highly accelerated lifetime test halt cycling including high and low temperatures rapid temperature cycling and high vibration levels thermal imaging was also used to check for hot spots all of the production boards were subjected to hass testing less stressful version of halt the testing culminated in month long burn in of the complete doms which included cycling from room temperature to of the doms survive deployment and freeze in completely another is impaired but usable usually they have lost their local coincidence connections postfreeze in reliability has been excellent and the estimated yr survival probability is hardware determining the time and amplitude of an observed light pulse requires good calibrations icecube uses variety of methods to ensure good calibrations the primary timing calibration is rapcal reciprocal active pulsing rapcal timing calibrations are performed automatically every few seconds during each calibration the surface electronics send timing signal down to each dom which waits few until cable reflections die out and then sends an identical signal to the surface the surface and dom electronics use identical dacs and adcs to send and receive signals so the transmission times in each direction are identical figure shows typical waveforms after km of cable even though the km cable transmission widens the signals to the transmission time is determined to less than ns other timing calibrations measure the signal propagation delay through the pmt and electronics each main board includes uv led on board led in fig which may be pulsed on command the led pulse current is recorded in the atwd along with the pmt signals the difference determines the pmt transit time plus the delay in the delay line and other electronics amplitude calibrations are also done with the on board led it is flashed repeatedly at low intensity photoelectron in the pmt charge histogram is accumulated in the fpga and sent to the surface where it is fit to find the single photoelectron peak this is done for range of high voltages and the hv is set to give pmt gain these calibrations are extremely stable over time periods of months each dom also contains flasher board with leds mounted around its edges these leds are used for variety of calibrations measuring light transmission and timing between different doms the multiplicity of leds is particularly useful for linearity calibrations the leds are flashed individually and then together providing ladder of light amplitudes that can be used to map out the saturation curve calibrations are also studied using cosmic ray muons plus two special devices the standard candles these are extra modules containing nm laser mounted between two doms on cable the laser beam is shaped to emit light in the shape of cherenkov cone forming reasonable approximation to cascade the light output is well calibrated and an absorber wheel allows for variable intensities although the nm light does not propagate as far as typical cherenkov radiation peaked around nm after factoring in detection probability it provides reasonable simulation of cascades up to pev energies figure shows one of the higher level time calibrations using the led flashers the time difference is that expected for the dom to dom separation and the rms times for all of the adjacent dom pairs on the string are between and ns it is worth pointing out that although the doms are adjacent the signals only come together at the surface so there is effectively km of cable separating the two doms other studies using muons give similar timing resolutions the relative timing calibrations are stable over time periods of at least months figure shows block diagram of the surface electronics almost all of the hardware is commercial the only exceptions are the dor cards that receive the signals from eight doms the cards plug into standard pci slots in standard industrial pcs called string hubs fig shows block diagram of string hub each string hub holds eight dor cards so one hub can control an entire detector string because of the higher data rate the icetop doms are plugged into separate set of hubs with doms per hub besides sending control commands to the doms and receiving data the dor cards also distribute the dc power to the doms the cards also monitor the power consumption and communication error rates and can turn individual twisted pairs on or off the string hubs convert the time stamps from the doms into calibrated times time order these times and send that information to trigger processor trigger decisions are made on the basis of hlc hit times slc hits and the amplitude and waveform information are not used gps receiver provides single master clock signal which is distributed throughout the surface electronics matched cables are used to maintain timing across the system icecube uses several trigger criteria the most commonly used trigger selects time intervals where eight doms with local coincidences fired within this collects most of the neutrino events in string trigger was added it selects time intervals when five out of seven adjacent doms fired within this trigger has improved sensitivity for low energy events especially upward going muons proposed topological trigger will be optimized for low energy horizontal muons other triggers are under development for deepcore when trigger occurs all data within s trigger window is saved becoming an event if multiple trigger windows overlap then all of the data from the ored time intervals are saved as single event icetop uses two different trigger criteria based on the number of hit stations station is pair of nearby tanks station is considered hit if the high gain dom fired in one tank in coincidence with the lower gain dom in the other this was implemented in hardware by cross wiring the local coincidence circuitry higher energy events above about tev were collected with trigger that required eight hit stations prescaled lower energy trigger requires three stations to be hit all of the triggered data are reconstructed by an on line filter system and selected events are transmitted via satellite to the northern hemisphere the filters use simple physics based criteria first guess reconstruction algorithms and simplified maximum likelihood fitting current filters select upward going muons cascades and all flavor neutral current interactions extremely high energy events starting and stopping events and air showers seen in icetop for the string running these filters selected about of the events comprising about gbytes day all of the data including the data selected for satellite transmission are stored on tapes at the south pole station the tapes are sent north during the austral summer the first stage of event reconstruction converts the pmt waveforms into photon arrival times as shown in fig the first step is to calibrate the waveform converting adc counts and atwd fadc time bins into absolute times and voltages the next step is to extract photon arrival times this is done with several methods the standard approach is to perform bayesian peak unfolding the algorithm searches for pmt like pulses with the correct shape and removes them from the waveform one by one these photon arrival times are used in maximum likelihood fitting event reconstruction icecube can reconstruct the three different neutrino flavors based on the event topology figure shows examples of three different types of interactions the top panel shows kilometer long muon track or multiple parallel muons from shower traversing the detector the long lever arm provides good directional reconstruction better than the muon energy can be estimated by the track length for muons that start and stop in the detector or from the specific energy loss at energies above tev muon energy loss de dx is proportional to the muon energy figure middle shows cascade from simulated event the light is nearly pointlike although most of the light is emitted near the cherenkov angle many of the photons scatter before being detected partially washing out the angular information figure bottom shows simulated few pev interaction forming classic double bang topology one bang occurs when the interacts that interaction also produces which travels few hundred meters before decaying and producing second bang several other decay modes are under study in icecube other topologies are also of interest can interact in the detector producing hadronic shower from the struck nucleus plus the track if the neutrino interaction vertex can be clearly identified it may be possible to search for neutrino sources above the horizon at moderate energies stopping muons may also be visible upward going track pairs are also possible these are predicted in some supersymmetric and kaluza klein models of course the vast majority of triggers are down going muons from cosmic ray air showers they outnumber neutrino induced events by about rejection of this background is major challenge for event selection events are reconstructed by fitting them to one of these topological hypotheses the likelihood fits are seeded with variety of first guess methods to find starting points for muons the main first guess method fits moving plane to the launch times in the doms for muon the plane should have velocity near the speed of light an alternate approach uses the measured charge deposition along the long axis of events such as in fig top the maximum likelihood fitter calculates the likelihood for different track positions and directions and optionally energy it does this by using functions that account for the light propagation through the ice these functions are calculated via monte carlo simulation which tracks individual photons through the ice accumulating the amplitude and time information in seven dimensional histogram these tables give the probability distribution for photon radiated from track with given orientation to reach dom at given perpendicular distance and orientation as function of time depth is one dimension the depth dependent optical properties of the ice are properly included the huge background of downward going muons must be eliminated using very tight cuts in addition to the obvious cut on muon zenith angle cuts are made based on the estimated errors returned from the likelihood fit these probe the depth of the minimum in the likelihood function bayesian reconstructions are also used the likelihood of track having given zenith angle is weighted by the relative size of the signal at that zenith angle this effectively requires that the upward going hypothesis be much more likely icecube is large enough that there is significant background from coincident muon events when two or more muons from different cosmic ray air showers are coincident in time in icecube specific algorithms have been developed to find and reject these events these cuts leave relatively clean sample of well reconstructed neutrino events as shown in fig an irreducible background of atmospheric neutrinos remains with the full detector we expect to detect about atmospheric interactions per day we will now discuss performance metrics and results from the partially completed detector data with strings were collected in and the string data were taken in based on data taken with strings the expected effective area of the completed icecube detector is shown in fig the effective area is two to three times larger than had been anticipated in the original design the main reasons for the improved efficiency are the unexpected optical quality of the ice in the lower half of the detector and the improved analysis methods exploiting the superior information provided by the doms we have also performed first test of the angular resolution for reconstructing muon tracks by observing the shadow of the moon the moon blocks cosmic rays from spot in the sky reducing the flux of muons produced by cosmic rays with eight lunar months of data taken with strings we have observed deficit of more than in the direction of the moon see fig the next stage of this analysis will allow us to verify the icecube angular resolution which we anticipate to be close to the result confirms studies of the alignment of icecube muon and icetop shower directions the accumulating data will allow us to actually check the angular resolution of the detector the present status of the search for point sources of cosmic neutrinos is shown in fig the neutrino map is the result of novel unbinned search method that doubled the sensitivity of icecube over the binned methods previously used in any given direction in the sky two likelihoods are compared that the data sample is consistent with uniform background of atmospheric neutrinos and muons modeled by the data and ii that the data reveal point source in that particular direction for modeling the possibility of point source we use simulation that uses the actual point spread function of the detector and assumes an energy distribution for the map shown in this way potential sources of cosmic neutrinos are not only identified by the fact that they cluster in arrival direction the analysis also takes into account that their reconstructed energy is large and less likely to be accommodated by the atmospheric background of relatively low energy events the latter is modeled by the data themselves until recently point source searches with the icecube neutrino telescope have been restricted to the northern hemisphere one exclusively selects upward going events as way of rejecting the atmospheric muon background thus one searches for cosmic sources in relatively pure sample of atmospheric neutrinos however by preferentially selecting high energy events icecube has sensitivity to high energy sources over the full sky above the horizon the background consists of high energy atmospheric muons or muon bundles rather than neutrinos but the method still applies efficient energy estimators are now crucial for background rejection through rising energy thresholds above the horizon signal efficiency depends strongly on declination and effectively defines lower energy threshold rising from the tev energy in the north to pev energies in the south for an spectrum unfortunately with one half year of data taken with km detector we are not yet sensitive to the predictions for cosmic neutrino fluxes associated with cosmic ray sources previously discussed however with growing detector we expect to reach the required neutrino exposure within few years if many sources contribute to the neutrino flux then searches for diffuse neutrino flux may be more sensitive than searches for individual point sources the diffuse flux will be separable from the atmospheric background via several features the first is its energy spectrum diffuse flux is expected to have dn de energy spectrum whereas the bulk of the atmospheric spectrum is much softer dn de prompt neutrinos from the decay of charmed and heavy quarks have lower flux but harder spectrum dn de at energies above about few hundred tev prompt neutrinos will dominate the atmospheric background however their spectrum is still softer than the diffuse flux the second separator is the flavor spectrum diffuse neutrinos will have traveled long distances so the neutrino flux ratio should be in contrast the atmospheric flux is expected to be while the prompt flux should be this is why studies of multiple flavors are so important icecube is very close to being sensitive to the waxman bahcall limit with both ref and over decade icecube will collect of the order of atmospheric neutrino events covering the energy range of tev this sample is two orders of magnitude larger than the total sample collected by amanda cosmic beams of even higher energy may exist the sampling of physics topics ranges from the relatively straightforward to the positively exotic even in the absence of new physics measurement of the neutrino cross section at eev energy represents powerful test of the standard model these interactions resolve partons with fractional momentum bjorken values as low as on the more exotic side very high energy short wavelength neutrinos may interact with the space time foam predicted by theories of quantum gravity they will propagate through space like light through crystal lattice and be delayed with the delay depending on the energy this will appear to the observer as violation of lorenz invariance back of the envelope calculations are sufficient to show that observations of neutrinos produced by gamma ray bursts reach planck scale sensitivity in the end the possibilities are only limited by our imagination and are still being identified icecube has contributed to glaciology and monitors the south pole atmosphere including the ozone hole using atmospheric muons one idea under study is to perform neutrino tomography of the earth using atmospheric neutrinos the earth is opaque to high energy muon neutrinos because of their increased interaction cross sections the diameter of the earth represents one absorption length for muon neutrino with an energy of tev an initially uniform flux of atmospheric neutrinos from the northern hemisphere is modified in transit through the earth modifications are visible for neutrino energies in the tev region neutrinos within of vertical transit the earth core whereas at larger angles neutrinos traverse only the mantle as the lightest of fermions and the most weakly interacting of particles neutrinos occupy fragile corner of the standard model and one can realistically hope that they will reveal the first and most dramatic signatures of new physics for review see ref some topics that icecube will explore are listed below the search for signatures of the possible unification of particle interactions including gravity at the tev scale neutrinos with energies approaching this scale would interact by gravity with large cross sections similar to those of quarks and leptons their increased interaction cross section will create dramatic signatures in neutrino telescope including possibly the production of black holes the search for deviations from the neutrino established oscillatory behavior that result from nonstandard interactions g neutrino decay or quantum decoherence the search for breakdown of the equivalence principle as result of nonuniversal interactions with the gravitational field of neutrinos of different flavors similarly the search for breakdown of lorentz invariance resulting from different limiting velocities of neutrinos of different masses with energies of tev and masses of order ev or less even the atmospheric neutrinos observed by icecube reach lorentz factors of or larger the search for particle emission from cosmic strings or any other topological defects or heavy cosmological remnants created in the early universe it has been suggested that they may be the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays the search for magnetic monopoles balls and the like with its lower energy threshold and mton instrumented volume deepcore will explore additional physics topics especially involving atmospheric neutrino oscillations gev threshold will give us access to the first oscillation induced flux minimum near gev with unprecedented statistics the low threshold opens the energy window for atmospheric neutrino oscillation measurements including disappearance first observation of appearance and possibly if the mixing angle is large enough the sign of the neutrino mass hierarchy the icecube deepcore detectors were designed to detect neutrinos with energies ranging from to ev nevertheless large burst of mev supernova neutrinos streaming through the detector will produce an observable signal in the pmts photons are predominantly produced by the cherenkov radiation from showers produced by the interaction of supernova neutrinos p n with protons in the ice the cherenkov radiation can be identified as collective rise in the photomultiplier rates on top of their dark noise cherenkov photon is detected provided the neutrino interacts within of digital optical module this corresponds to fiducial volume of mtons for doms the cherenkov photons produce an excess counting rate above the steady hz dark noise of photomultiplier deployed in the sterile antarctic ice the combined significance of the excess counts in doms exceeds for supernova collapse occurring as far as the small magellanic cloud icecube will be able to provide high statistics measurement of the time profile corresponding to mton conventional proton decay and supernova search experiment in supernova search icecube simply counts neutrinos and does not observe the energy or direction of individual events on the other hand icecube will collect over events from supernova at kpc the most likely distance for instance supernova explosion at the most probable distance of kpc releasing after oscillations ergs in electron antineutrinos with an average energy of mev will produce neutrino burstn etot cm etot ergs mev kpcd this flux is cm and leads to the detection of events per dom for total of events e over events sampled in time bins of ms nev etot ergs mev kpcd vdet e mev ndom the first square bracket scales the dependence on the number of neutrinos detected by icecube according to the supernova parameters the second according to the properties of the detector the event rate is based on flux of produced cherenkov photons for every mev of neutrino energy the rate has been determined from variety of detailed simulations including geant as was the case for the historic observation the high statistics observations of st century supernova will further our understanding of star collapse and of neutrino physics including the possible determination of and the mass hierarchy the evidence that yet to be detected weakly interacting massive particles wimps make up dark matter is compelling wimps are swept up by the sun as the solar system moves about the galactic halo though interacting weakly they will occasionally scatter elastically with nuclei in the sun and lose enough momentum to become gravitationally bound over the lifetime of the sun enough wimps may accumulate in its center to establish equilibrium between their capture and annihilation the annihilation products of these wimps represent an indirect signature of halo dark matter their presence revealed by neutrinos that escape the sun the neutrinos are for instance the decay products of heavy quarks and weak bosons resulting from the annihilation of wimps into bb or w these can be efficiently identified by icecube because of the relatively large neutrino energy that is on the order of the mass of the wimp the beauty of the indirect detection technique using neutrinos is that the astrophysics of the problem is understood the source in the sun has built up over solar time sampling the dark matter throughout the galaxy therefore any possible structure in the halo has been averaged out given wimp mass and interaction cross section with ordinary matter one can unambiguously predict the signal in neutrino telescope if not observed the model is ruled out this is in contrast to indirect searches involving photons that are subject to theoretical uncertainties associated with the dark matter distribution especially in the very center of the galaxy although icecube detects neutrinos of all flavors sensitivity to neutrinos produced by wimps in the sun is achieved by exploiting the degree accuracy with which can be pointed back to the sun the string icecube data have resulted in limit on an excess flux from the sun it improves on previous results by factors of for wimps heavier than approximately gev although hardly competitive with direct searches for wimps with spin independent interactions with ordinary matter for spin dependent interactions icecube has improved the best limits on wimp cross sections by two orders of magnitude see fig cosmic the icecube icetop combination is potent cosmic ray detector icetop detects showers and icecube observes the associated muons the combination is sensitive to the cosmic ray composition heavier primary cosmic rays produce more muons at given energy also uniquely icecube can search for muons hundreds of meters from the shower core these muons come from high transverse momentum interactions in the air shower by itself icecube will collect huge sample of muons from cosmic ray interactions the homogeneity of the ice allows for careful studies of cosmic ray arrival directions using downward going events icecube found small anisotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays as seen in fig the median muon energy is about tev the primary energies are even higher this is puzzling result as the arrival directions of charged particles should be scrambled by galactic magnetic fields this result complements earlier studies using northern hemisphere detectors proposed interpretations fall into two categories that the asymmetry in arrival directions of cosmic rays is either associated with unknown structure in the galactic magnetic field or with diffusive particle flows from nearby galactic sources such as vela the broad cosmic ray anisotropy shown in the figure aligns with observations in the northern hemisphere it is intriguing that prominent structure there seems to be associated with major photon source geminga at energies above ev guaranteed source of neutrinos emerges these are gzk neutrinos produced when cosmic ray protons with energies above ev interact with the cosmic microwave background photons the predicted rate for gzk neutrinos is at most of the order of event km yr icecube is not big enough one must trade threshold energy for active volume two techniques have been proposed for these large area detectors searching for radio waves or for acoustic pulses from neutrino interactions to be able to build large enough detector with reasonable number of elements requires that the signal waves g radio and acoustic pulses have an attenuation length in the medium of the order of km this is required but not necessarily sufficient condition to detect signals using an array with detector spacing of the order of km radio pulses are generated from the charged particles that are produced in neutrino interactions high energy electromagnetic showers contain about more electrons than positrons because photons in the shower compton scatter atomic electrons the cherenkov radiation from the shower is coherent at wavelengths longer than the transverse size of the showers e above mhz the radio signal scales as the square of the neutrino energy leading to an effective threshold of at least ev coherent cherenkov radiation has been studied using beams of gev electrons striking ice sand and salt targets measurements of the rf power frequency spectrum and angular distributions are in good agreement with theoretical predictions in cold ice radio wave attenuation length is of the order of km far longer than for optical photons the longer length allows km detectors to be built using reasonable number of detection stations number of experiments are working to take advantage of this most radio experiments have looked for signals from distant targets the large separation between the radiator and the detector inevitably leads to higher thresholds often above eev most recently the antarctic impulse transit antenna anita balloon experiment has twice circled antarctica at altitudes around its quad ridged horn antennas scanned about km of antarctic ice reaching lower threshold requires placing the antennas in or very near the active volume the first effort in this direction was by the radio ice cherenkov experiment rice collaboration who installed dipole antennas in some of the amanda holes and set limits down to ev new proposal has been put forth to extend the icecube array outward by placing antennas in shallow holes this detector would ultimately cover km see ref unfortunately recent measurements indicate that the acoustic attenuation length in polar ice is short of the order of this will severely limit the effectiveness of an acoustic detector nevertheless it may still be cost effective to use acoustic detectors to supplement radio array acoustic detectors have also been considered for other media including salt domes the dead sea and siberian permafrost the antarctic ross ice shelf antenna neutrino array arianna collaboration has new approach using radio detectors on the thick ross ice shelf in antarctica the ice water interface below the ice shelf is near perfect reflector for radio waves with this reflection radio waves from downward going neutrinos will reach the surface greatly increasing arianna sensitivity although none of these experiments have observed signal their results are beginning to constrain models of gzk neutrinos neutrino experiment large enough to observe several gzk neutrinos per year would complement cosmic ray experiments such as auger unlike protons these neutrinos point back to their sources the reason is that neutrino produced within an mpc gzk radius from its source located at typical cosmological distance of the order of gigaparsecs will reveal the source location within the relatively poor angular resolution of neutrino telescope the km icecube neutrino observatory detects cherenkov radiation from charged particles produced in neutrino interactions total of digital optical modules is being deployed on vertical strings with doms attached at depths between and the doms observe cherenkov photons from charged particles produced in neutrino interactions the bulk of icecube is sensitive to neutrinos with energies above gev the deepcore infill array may observe neutrinos with energies as low as gev the icetop surface array located on the ice above icecube consists of ice filled tanks each instrumented with two doms it observes cosmic ray air showers with threshold of about gev icecube acts like tracking calorimeter recording the pattern of energy deposition in the ice each dom includes complete data acquisition system the higher pressures and low temperatures along with the inaccessible locations impose stringent requirements on these modules despite this over of the deployed modules are working perfectly with global time resolution of about ns segmentation allows icecube to separate and interactions we have developed reconstruction methods that effectively separate upward going muons from interactions from the much more intense cosmic ray muon background these methods achieve an angular resolution of better than for long tracks the early data from icecube are extremely promising and the partial detector is now observing over neutrino events per year  rapid prototyping of polydimethylsiloxane pdms is often used to build microfluidic devices however the inherent hydrophobic nature of the material limits the use of pdms in many applications while different methods have been developed to transform the hydrophobic pdms surface to hydrophilic surface the actual implementation proved to be time consuming due to differences in equipment and the need for characterization this paper reports simple and easy protocol combining second extended oxygen plasma treatments and proper storage to produce usable hydrophilic pdms devices the results show that at plasma power of an extended treatment of over min would allow the pdms surface to remain hydrophilic for more than storing the treated pdms devices in de ionized water would allow them to maintain their hydrophilicity for weeks atomic force microscopy analysis shows that longer oxygen plasma time produces smoother surface polydimethylsiloxane pdms is one of the most widely used silicone based polymers in microfluidics the ease of fabrication low cost biocompatibility elastomeric property and optical transparency are attractive reasons for its wide usage in rapid prototyping however despite these advantages the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pdms restricts its use in certain applications for example analysis of biological samples and chemical synthesis require hydrophilic surfaces in order to work expeditiously electrophoretic separation also requires adequate surface wettability stable droplet and bubble formations require the continuous phase fluid to preferentially wet the channel walls from the above mentioned applications surface properties of pdms are to be considered in the design and fabrication of microfluidic devices in the past the surface properties of pdms has been modified using different methods such as coating of the inner walls attachment of active groups plasma oxidation thermal aging and chemical coating however most methods require hours to process and to characterize before one can effectively use the devices in addition the varieties in technologies and equipment of different laboratories cause further delay in the implementation of the technology recognizing this predicament this paper reports simple protocol to produce pdms with hydrophilic channel walls without the use of additional chemicals or equipment the characterization of this method also ensures that the device can be stored for days before use while maintaining the hydrophilicity of the channel walls within time span reasonable for experimentation oxygen plasma treatment has been used extensively by many in the fabrication of pdms microfluidic devices the treatment of oxygen plasma on pdms introduces polar functional groups which is mainly the silanol group sioh this group changes the surface properties of pdms from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic on the one hand normal plasma treated surfaces undergo hydrophobic recovery within minutes after bonding and thermal treatment on the other hand extended plasma treatment induces undesirable surface cracks which affect the bonding integrity of the device hydrophobic recovery of pdms has been well studied by sessile water contact angle measurement scanning electron microscopy and ray photoelectron spectroscopy the main reasons for hydrophobic recovery are the reorientation of the polar groups from the surface to the bulk diffusion of pre existing low molecular weight species from the bulk to the surface and condensation of the hydroxyl groups the recovery rate is also affected by storage condition such as temperature humidity aqueous fluid and surfactants used to store the pdms device to our knowledge limited or very few studies report on surface modification using bonded and sealed pdms device most studies are conducted using thin pdms membranes which are not bonded together to form typical concealed microfluidic device the main purpose of the technique reported in this paper is to perform surface modification on fully bonded and functional microfluidic device the test devices used in this work are fabricated using standard soft lithography to summarize we casted the pdms substrate sylgard dow corning on master mold made of the thick film resist su the thickness of the su layer is the pdms substrate with the microchannel was first peeled off from the master mold manual puncher harris uni core world precision instruments inc florida usa of mm diameter was then used to create the fluidic access into the device oxygen plasma created by plasma reactor series plasma therm inc florida usa was then used to bond the former pdms substrate to slab of blank pdms the bonded pdms devices were then placed in an oven at for to ensure good bonding between both surfaces figure shows the schematic sketch of the microchannel used in the test the straight channel has width of and height of contact angle measurements are carried out for stationary water plug in the channel as depicted in fig b the fully bonded and leak free devices subsequently underwent second oxygen plasma treatment total of six different treatment times was used to study the effectiveness of the protocol proposed while the plasma power was kept constant at the treatment times were varied as and immediately after the plasma treatment the devices were immersed in container filled with de ionized di water air bubbles are removed by injecting di water through the access holes and storing in vacuum chamber for days this duration provides realistic time scale in commercial context where the storage and delivery of the devices may take longer than in the laboratory environment the vacuum ensures that all air bubbles trapped in the devices were removed and devices are stored at constant low temperature for the characterization experiments the devices were removed from the vacuum chamber and di water within the microchannels was removed manually using syringes in order to ensure minimal amount of di water remaining in the channel manual pumping of the syringes was repeated at least times thereafter di water is pumped into the device at very slow rate of h using precision syringe pump kds kd scientific the flow is then stopped when the fluid just entered the inlet port stabilization time of min is then used to obtain near static image of the clear meniscus of the water air interface an epifluorescent inverted microscope nikon eclipse te was used to observe the meniscus of the liquid inside the channel sensitive interline transfer ccd camera hisense mkii dantec dynamics denmark was employed for recording the meniscus image images of the interfaces were then taken at periods of and from the time the devices are exposed to the ambient air in addition to ensure fair experimental conditions all the fluids are pumped out manually after each recording figure shows an example of the meniscus image taken at the interface for bonded pristine pdms microfluidic device total of pictures using ten similar devices for each plasma parameter are then evaluated and averaged using customized matlab program the program first imports the bitmap image and converts it into binary form subsequently the water air interface was detected by the contrast of the interface the radius of curvature was detected by curve fitting with the known channel width of the contact angle is determined in degree for hydrophobic case as fig arccos r for the hydrophilic case the contact angle is fig arccos r the measured results for the case of bonded pristine pdms microfluidic device without the second plasma treatment agree well with the reported result measured using conventional contact angle measurement with sessile water droplet for our case the contact angle measured was about while the reported case was about therefore it is reasonable to assume that our measured results also correlate fairly well with measurement using sessile droplet to further ascertain the surface properties of the proposed protocol atomic force microscopy afm analysis veeco was performed on blank pdms slabs measuring cm before and after oxygen plasma treatments the afm images were obtained using the tapping mode the scanning area used was all afm tests were carried out within after exposure to the oxygen plasma the root mean square rms roughness was measured on the area without the nanocracks which was formed due to the oxygen plasma treatment however these nanocracks can be useful recent studies have shown that these nanocracks can be decorated with adhesive proteins which support the growth and modulation of biological cells figure depicts the rms roughness at different oxygen plasma exposure times the result distinctively shows that exposure to oxygen plasma treatment decreases the roughness of the pdms surface for instance without any oxygen plasma treatment the rms roughness measures nm however the rms roughness decreases to nm after treatment of figure shows the contact angle as function of exposure time to air generally longer plasma treatment results in smaller contact angle pdms microchannel without additional plasma treatment circles in fig has an almost constant contact angle of the contact angle of fresh surface treated for is and increases to about after exposure to air treatment time of decreases the contact angle of the fresh surface further to the contact angle again approaches after exposure to air pdms channels with treatment time longer than have fresh contact angle of and can maintain contact angle between and after exposure to air the representative images of the meniscus of the water plug in microchannels with different treatment times are depicted in fig from the obtained results the concept of producing hydrophilic microchannels in pdms which can be stored and used when needed for experiments appears very promising devices treated with the second oxygen plasma of and can only retain the hydrophilicity contact angle of less than for about after exposure to air however with treatment time from to the devices remain hydrophilic and never fully regain their hydrophobicity during the time period of our investigation this difference also suggests that longer plasma time of or more may provide an efficacious remedy to the production of bonded and sealed hydrophilic pdms microfluidic devices possible explanation for the above difference is that as the pdms devices are bonded the ionized gas is only able to enter into the inner channel walls via the fluidic access holes as result limited amount of ionized gas diffused into the inner channel walls and does not result in the formation of brittle silica layers which facilitate the migration of low molar mass molecules from the bulk of the structure to the inner walls according to one dimensional diffusion approximation of x where is the diffusion time is the characteristic length and is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen plasma ions the exposure time is well sufficient to cover the entire channel length for instance with diffusion coefficient on the order of the plasma takes only about to diffuse along channel length of mm devices with longer treatment time show minimum changes to the hydrophobic recovery rate when the plasma time increases from to this could be due to saturation of the ionized gas which is able to diffuse into the microchannel the second plasma treatment done after the devices are well bonded ensures that minimum damage is incurred at the inner channel walls despite prolonged plasma treatment time the results also ascertain that storage of pdms devices in water and under vacuum is able to prolong the hydrophilicity of the pdms device for at least days or more the high surface energy of water prevents the reorganization of the silanol group sioh on the inner channel walls this hypothesis suggests that changing the surface energy of the fluid may affect the storage time of hydrophilic pdms devices as shown in fig longer exposure time creates smoother surface which also affects the hydrophobic recovery kinetics of the pdms surfaces the hydrophobic recovery rate decreases with increasing plasma exposure time and this agrees well with measured contact angles reported above however as the confinement of the channel influences the result of the plasma treatment the in channel surface analysis cannot effectively be compared with the case of planar surface for example the measured minimum contact angle reached in our study was which is well above the complete wetting condition of less than obtained for planar surface this difference could well be due to the nature of exposure in our case limited oxygen ions can only enter the channel through the inlets access while planar surface has direct exposure to the oxygen ions in summary the concept of producing hydrophilic pdms devices through the use of second extended oxygen plasma treatment after bonding and the storage in di water under vacuum condition proves to be feasible the method reported in this paper can maintain the hydrophilicity of the devices for several weeks at plasma power and treatment time longer than the pdms surface can remain hydrophilic for more than after the exposure to ambient air the reasonably low contact angle between and is sufficient for most microfluidic applications the time span of is also enough for most experiments in microfluidics surface analysis reveals that longer plasma treatment time produces much smoother surface  hardness is an essential property for wide range of applications however hardness alone typically accompanied by brittleness is not sufficient to prevent failure in ceramic films exposed to high stresses using vn as model system we demonstrate with experiment and density functional theory dft that refractory vmon alloys exhibit not only enhanced hardness but dramatically increased ductility mo hardness is higher than that of vn in addition while nanoindented vn as well as tin reference samples suffer from severe cracking typical of brittle ceramics mo films do not crack instead they exhibit material pile up around nanoindents characteristic of plastic flow in ductile materials moreover the wear resistance of mo is considerably higher than that of vn dft results show that tuning the occupancy of t metallic bonding states in vmon facilitates dislocation glide and hence enhances toughness via the formation of stronger metal metal bonds along the slip direction and weaker metal bonds across the slip plane hardness is an essential property for wide range of thin film applications including wear and abrasion resistant coatings over the past two decades major quest in materials science has been the development of artificial materials with increasing hardness successful examples include phase stability tuning superhardening of refractory nitrides via the development of artificial superlattices nano scale composites vacancy induced hardening and polytype mixtures in transition metal carbides and nitrides however each of these hardening mechanisms extracts steep price in terms of increased brittleness in order to avoid brittle failure due to cracking thin films must be both hard and ductile this combination of properties is referred to as toughness measure of the resistance of material to crack formation several thin film toughening approaches have been developed including the incorporation of ductile phases multilayer structures compressive stresses phase transformations and carbon nanotubes however these approaches which are based on methods applied to bulk materials raise significant problems in coatings the slow progress in obtaining hard yet tough ceramic coatings is due to the relatively primitive state of the present understanding of thin film toughness with only small number of studies dedicated to the electronic origin of brittleness vs ductility recently sangiovanni et al using ab initio density functional theory dft predicted enhanced toughness in pseudobinary nacl structure tm nitride alloys of tin or vn and mon or wn with cu pt ordering on the cation sublattice toughness enhancement in such alloys stems from the high valence electron concentration vec which leads during shear to an electronic structure consisting of alternating layers of high and low charge density orthogonal to the applied stress this in turn allows selective response to tetragonal and trigonal deformations if compressive tensile stresses are applied the structure responds by resisting deformation upon application of shear stress however the layered electronic arrangement allows the sample to respond in ductile tough manner as dislocation glide along the bar slip system becomes energetically favored here we experimentally demonstrate that the combination of increased hardness with enhanced ductility is inherent to nacl structure mo mgo compared to the binary parent compound vn mgo and tin mgo reference samples independent of atomic ordering in addition the wear resistance of mo is considerably higher than that of vn new dft calculations show that in disordered mo alloys the filling of t states due to the high vec also leads to enhanced dislocation mobility in this case however toughness arises not from layered charge density structure as for cu pt ordered alloys but from the formation of stronger metal metal bonds along the slip direction and weaker metal and metal metal bonds across the slip plane as shown by crystal orbital overlap population coop

film hardness and elastic moduli are determined based on the oliver and pharr method from nanoindentation measurements in hysitron ti triboindenter using berkovich diamond probe radius and calibrated using fused silica reference sample the maximum indentation depth is of the film thickness in all cases film toughness is assessed based upon analyses of sample cracks or material pile up adjacent to indent edges via scanning electron and scanning probe microscopies sem and spm following nanoindentation experiments at constant depth with sharp cube corner tip wear tests are performed over areas using cube corner tip with constant load of at scan rate of s for cycles each scan consists of lines with lateral displacement of per line dft calculations are accomplished using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp implemented with the generalized gradient approximation gga and the projector augmented wave paw method the rectangular simulation supercell consists of four planes with atoms each the non ordered alloy configuration is generated by employing modified special quasirandom structure sqs method which provides negligible short range order randomization is carried out on individual planes to achieve low metal metal correlation on circular neighboring shells around each metal atom in addition since the deposited films do not exhibit cu pt ordering simulation supercell layers are shuffled until nearly equal concentrations of mo and atoms are obtained on each plane equilibrium structures are determined by minimizing the total energy to within an accuracy of ev atom upon relaxing the atomic positions cell shape and volume elastic constants and moduli are calculated as described in refs and and using plane wave energy cutoff of ev and point grids for electron density and coop calculations we use point grids charge transfer maps are obtained by subtracting gas phase atom electron densities from the alloy charge density coop corresponds to the electron density of states dos resolved into bonding and antibonding states and is used to quantify the strength of the covalent component of chemical bonds we calculate coop values following the procedures used in refs and and the integration of coop functions over all occupied states icoop is measure of bond strengths the calculated alloy mixing enthalpy is negative ev atom e the alloy is stable with respect to mixing of the parent cubic binary compounds the combination of xtem and xrd analyses reveals that all films vn mgo mo mgo and tin mgo are epitaxial with the nacl structure and exhibit cube on cube orientation relationship to the substrate g vmon mgo and vmon mgo the only v mo mgo xrd peaks observed over the range are the and mgo reflections at and and the mo film peak at xrd reciprocal space maps fig reveal that mo alloy films are fully relaxed with ao the v mo ratio obtained from rbs measurements is vn and tin reference layers have out of plane lattice parameters of and in agreement with previous reports v and ti fig shows typical high resolution xtem hr xtem images with corresponding saed patterns as insets of epitaxial mo mgo layers viewed along and zone axes the hr xtem image exhibits uniform lattice fringe contrast characteristic of randomly distributed metal sublattice the saed patterns are composed of symmetric single crystal reflections there is no evidence in the pattern of superstructure reflections characteristic of cu pt ordering on the metal sublattice which in this case would correspond to alternating and mo rich planes as observed for ti n mgo alloys the elastic moduli obtained from nanoindentation results using calculated poisson ratios tin vn and vmon are evmon etin and evn gpa the nanoindentation modulus evmon is in reasonable agreement with the modulus calculated for the disordered alloy gpa the hardness of vmon hvmon gpa is higher than that of vn hvn gpa and comparable with tin htin gpa thus alloying vn with mon enhances hardness by while the elastic modulus remains essentially constant the combined results are one indication of enhanced toughness the ductility of epitaxial mo layers compared to epitaxial vn and tin reference layers is also evaluated via nanoindentation experiments but in this case with sharp cube corner diamond tip ten or more indents to constant depth of are produced in each thick film thus extending into the mgo substrates by typical sem and spm images of the results are presented in fig vn and tin reference samples figs and exhibit severe cracking characteristic of brittle ceramic films along directions around the indents in distinct contrast cracks are never observed in mo films see fig instead indented alloy layers exhibit material pile up along indent edges figs and characteristic of plastic flow in ductile materials from analyses of spm results the volume of the pile up is approximately these results combined with the hardness data are second and more direct demonstration of the enhanced toughness of mo alloys in addition the wear rate defined as the difference in absolute values between the mean height outside and inside the scanned area decreases by factor of five from nm cycle for vn to nm cycle for mo in parallel with our experiments we perform calculations on non ordered nacl structure vmon alloys the calculated cauchy pressure c and shear bulk modulus ratio b often used as ductility criteria for cubic systems indicate that irrespective of the degree of ordering mo c gpa b alloys are significantly more ductile than both tin c gpa b and vn c gpa b however since these measures only provide qualitative indications of toughness we also probe the mo electronic structure to provide atomistic insights into the electronic origin of the enhanced toughness of mo we show charge transfer plots for relaxed and sheared disordered alloys in figs and stress is applied along directions to obtain shear strain in order to simulate massive deformation under penetration by the cube corner tip the plots are oriented to depict the most common slip system for the nacl structure bar with the horizontal axis along the direction of the burgers vector and the glide plane viewed edge on corresponding charge transfer maps for vn and tin not shown consist of spherical charge distributions around both cation and anion sites due to pronounced ionic bonding it is evident that alloying with mon significantly alters bonding configurations mo forms weak d eg bonds fig with both the under and overlying planes as evidenced by gold colored lobes see color code between mo and atoms one set of lobes is indicated by arrows the filling of the t bonding states due to the high vec leads to delocalization of charge between metal atoms along directions upon shearing fig electron charge transfer occurs from metal and metal metal bonds orthogonal to the glide plane to metal metal bonds oriented along the slip direction thus promoting dislocation mobility upon shearing mo icoop values orthogonal to the slip plane decrease by for metal bonds n and mo and for metal metal bonds v mo and mo mo however along the glide plane icoop for metal metal bonds increases by v mo and mo mo changes in icoop due to shearing of vn are analogous but smaller icoop decreases for n bonds and for v bonds across the slip plane while increasing for v bonds within the glide plane overall upon shearing mo forms considerably stronger metal metal bonds within the glide plane metal metal icoop compared to vn for which v icoop with much weaker metal bonds across the slip plane for which mo metal icoop and vn n icoop moreover the pronounced ionic character of n bonds in vn see charge transfer maps in fig of ref further hinders dislocation glide overall the addition of mon to vn provides vec which optimizes the occupancy of metallic t bonding states in mo without filling antibonding states leading to the formation of stronger metal metal bonds within planes and weaker metal bonds parallel to the applied strain this in turn allows easier slip of planes along bar directions and explains why mo is inherently more ductile than vn and tin reference samples the alloy reacts in hard manner upon compression and in ductile manner upon shearing in summary we show that alloying the group tm nitride vn with group vi mon not only increases film hardness but also enhances ductility that is the alloy has higher toughness than the parent vn compound consistent with our dft results showing that the optimized occupancy of t metallic states in mo facilitates dislocation glide via the formation of stronger metal metal bonds along the slip direction and weaker metal bonds across the slip plane the combination of xrd hr xtem and saed reveals that the metal species in our tough mo alloys are disordered on the cation sublattice which is also consistent with dft simulations indicating that an ordered structure is not necessary to access the combination of high hardness and ductility the present results provide new insights into the electronic origin of toughness and demonstrate the possibility of tuning the hardness ductility ratio of pseudobinary transition metal nitride alloys via manipulation of electronic t state occupancy   paper based microfluidics or lab on paper as burgeoning research field with its beginning in provides novel system for fluid handling and fluid analysis for variety of applications including health diagnostics environmental monitoring as well as food quality testing the reasons why paper becomes an attractive substrate for making microfluidic systems include it is ubiquitous and extremely cheap cellulosic material it is compatible with many chemical biochemical medical applications and it transports liquids using capillary forces without the assistance of external forces by building microfluidic channels on paper liquid flow is confined within the channels and therefore liquid flow can be guided in controlled manner variety of and even microfluidic channels have been created on paper which are able to transport liquids in the predesigned pathways on paper at the current stage of its development paper based microfluidic system is claimed to be low cost easy to use disposable and equipment free and therefore is rising technology particularly relevant to improving the healthcare and disease screening in the developing world especially for those areas with no or low infrastructure and limited trained medical and health professionals the research in paper based microfluidics is experiencing period of explosion most published works have focused on inventing low cost and simple fabrication techniques for paper based microfluidic devices and exploring new applications of paper based microfluidics by incorporating efficient detection methods this paper aims to review both the fabrication techniques and applications of paper based microfluidics reported to date this paper also attempts to convey to the readers from the authors point of view the current limitations of paper based microfluidics which require further research and few perspective directions this new analytical system may take in its development the fabrication of paper based the invention of the paper based microfluidics which has been attributed to the whitesides group of harvard university actually has longer history the earlier work reported by ller et al may be the origin of this technology figure in ller and co worker conducted study on the preferential elution of mixture of pigments within the channel on paper they patterned filter paper by impregnating paraffin barrier on the paper and observed that the confined channel sped up the sample diffusion process and reduced sample consumption this paraffin patterned paper could therefore be regarded as the rudiment of the paper based microfluidics developed over recent years overall there are ten techniques reported in the literature for fabricating paper based microfluidic devices photolithography plotting with an analogue plotter ink jet etching plasma treatment paper cutting wax printing ink jet printing flexography printing screen printing and laser treatment the fundamental principle underlying these fabrication techniques is to pattern hydrophilic hydrophobic contrast on sheet of paper in order to create micron scale e hundreds to thousands of micrometers capillary channels on paper the cutting technique is an exception to this methodology it first shapes paper pattern by cutting it with computer controlled plotter cutter and then encases the shaped paper with sticky tape which serves as backing to create paper based microfluidic devices since this technique does not rely on the hydrophilic hydrophobic contrast it will not be included in the following discussion table lists the different patterning agents e hydrophobic agents patterning principles and approaches for each fabrication technique variety of hydrophobic substances have been utilized to define hydrophilic micro channels on paper from the relatively expensive agents such as photoresist su for patterning filter paper of cm the less expensive agents such as wax for patterning filter paper of cm to the extremely cheap agents such as alkyl ketene dimer akd for patterning filter paper of cm based on the binding states of hydrophobic agents to paper the paper patterning principles of these techniques can be divided into three categories physical blocking of the pores in paper using agents such as photoresist and polydimethylsiloxane pdms physical deposition of hydrophobizing reagent g polystyrene or wax on the cellulose fibre surfaces and chemical modification of fibre surfaces using cellulose reactive agents such as akd which is commodity grade of paper sizing hydrophobizing agent used in the papermaking industry physical pore blocking and physical fibre surface modification do not involve any chemical reactions between the hydrophobic agents and the cellulose fibres these agents are physically impregnated into paper pores or deposited onto the fibre surface the presence of these agents changes the liquid wetting properties of the paper making the formation of hydrophilic hydrophobic patterns in paper possible chemical modification of fibre surfaces is achieved by applying cellulose reactive agents to paper these agents typically react with the oh groups of cellulose imparting hydrophobicity to cellulose fibres generally paper hydrophobicity caused by chemical modification cannot be removed by organic solvent extraction whereas paper hydrophobicity caused by physical deposition can be largely removed by organic solvent washing making it possible to use organic solvent etching methods to fabricate paper based microfluidic devices the patterning approaches for each technique are classified into selective hydrophobization one step fabrication and ii entire hydrophobization followed by selective dehydrophobization two step fabrication the former approach is to directly deposit hydrophobic agents to the selected areas of sheet of paper to hydrophobize these areas areas not receiving patterning agents remain hydrophilic the prevailing techniques for achieving this contrast include wax printing and ink jet printing the latter approach involves first making the entire paper sheet hydrophobic and then etching selected areas of the hydrophobic paper to form hydrophilic regions using techniques such as photolithography ink jet etching and patterned plasma oxidation the advantages and limitations of each fabrication technique are listed in table ii to choose the proper technique researchers and manufacturers should consider range of factors including equipment availability material costs fabrication process simplicity and the intended applications of paper based microfluidic devices at present akd ink jet printing and wax printing might be the most promising techniques due to the low cost of patterning agents and easy rapid fabrication process both techniques can produce multiple devices or multizones on piece of sized paper figure within min with single print and heat cycle both techniques have the potential to be upgraded to pilot or even larger scale processes by which paper could first go through an ink jet printer or wax printer then through an oven for heat treatment to form hydrophilic hydrophobic contrast and finally through other ink jet printers which can print detection reagents required for assays or other applications figure the application of paper based the main application of paper based microfluidic devices is to provide low cost easy to use and portable analytical platform for assays either multi analyte or semi quantitative even quantitative in order to provide people living in the developing world with affordable disease diagnosis and environmental monitoring in terms of this application paper based microfluidic devices can be divided into two types on demand devices which are blank microfluidic platforms without pre deposited indication reagents depending on the samples to be tested the detection reagents are chosen and introduced into the devices by users prior to the test either before or after the adding of test samples figure ready to use devices which are designed as complete sensors by integrating indication reagents into the detection zones of the devices based on the particular detection chemistry incorporated this type of device is used to detect specific analytes in test samples figure using the on demand device the simultaneous detection of the enzyme activity of different samples was implemented in same device single device was also used to semi quantitatively or quantitatively measure the concentration of an analyte by concurrently detecting the unknown sample solutions and the standard solutions in the different detection zones of the device one example is the quantification of nitrite in an unknown sample most of the published works to date have been focusing on the applications of the ready to use device these applications include the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in sample solution well studied case is to use the glucose protein paper based sensor for the simultaneous determination of glucose and protein in urine sample and the semi quantitative analysis of multiple analytes by detecting the unknown sample and the standard solutions using set of devices for instance the quantification of glucose lactate and uric acid in urine sample table iii lists all analytes studied to date for different applications of paper based microfluidic devices in addition table iii also outlines the analytical applications of paper based microarray plates such plates comprise multiple hydrophilic microzones on sheet of paper and can be fabricated by patterning paper using the aforementioned techniques for producing paper based microfluidic devices paper based microplates have been proposed as potential substitute of the traditional microtiter plate for enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisa in general four detection methods have been reported for the detection of analytes in paper based microfluidics colorimetric detection electrochemical ec detection chemiluminescence cl detection and electrochemiluminescence ecl detection table iii colorimetric detection chemistries are typically related to enzymatic or chemical color change reactions in most cases the analysis of results can be visually assessed by the unaided eye which is adequate when yes no answer or semi quantitative detection is sufficient for diagnosis ec detection has higher sensitivity enabling the detection and quantification of analytes even in the nm range besides electrochemistry unlike colorimetry is insensitive to local lighting conditions therefore is less prone to interference from certain types of contaminants suspended solids colored materials present in the samples most studies reported to date have been focusing on exploiting the colorimetric detection figure and the ec detection figure in paper based microfluidics cl and ecl are the most common optical detection methods in microfluidics they are performed in the dark and are therefore independent of ambient light however they have not been widely used in paper based microfluidics only few studies investigated using these two detection methods for detecting analytes in paper based microfluidic devices or paper based microarray plates figure shows an approach of conducting ecl detection on paper based microfluidic devices although paper based microfluidic devices provide low cost and simple platform for performing multi analyte detection and semi quantitative measurement more complex devices are required where there are multiple steps involved in the analysis diagnosis such as the premixing of samples before the final reaction under such circumstances functional elements could be incorporated into the devices for controlling the movement of fluids within paper based microchannels and for expanding the functions of the devices for example li et al designed paper based separator for filtering samples and paper based reactor for multi step reactions figure whitesides group reported the fabrication of paper based microfluidic devices which can distribute fluids both vertically and laterally enabling liquid transport from single inlet to numerous detection zones figure this group also designed programmable device with on buttons for connecting and disconnecting the fluid flow between paper based channels liu and crooks reported using the principles of origami for fabricating paper based microfluidic devices figure the research group led by yager has executed comprehensive studies on the characterization of fluid flow in paper based microfluidic channels and on controlled liquid sample transport noh et al described one method to control when and how quickly fluid is distributed into detection zones by integrating paraffin wax into pads as fluidic timers in more recent study yang et al designed paper based microfluidic device for separating blood plasma from small samples of whole blood in addition to the applications in analyte detection paper based microfluidic devices and microarray plates have also been used for other applications including to be used as template for fabricating thin materials such as films of ionotropic hydrogels which are used in drug delivery for encapsulation of cells and as sorbents for toxic metals in wound dressings to be used as stamp for the contact printing of biochemicals such as reagents antigens proteins and dna onto planar substrates to be used as flexible substrate for rapidly prototyping pdms microdevices which could simplify the operation procedures and reduce the fabrication cost of the devices and to be used as platform for cell culture and cell based analysis the current limitation of paper based the outstanding features of paper based microfluidic devices were extensively investigated in numerous studies and can be found in review articles published elsewhere it needs however to be pointed out that currently paper based microfluidic devices do have limitations which are related to the material properties of paper the fabrication techniques of the devices or the detection methods incorporated to the devices specifically these limitations include the following the sample retention e the ineffective sample consumption within paperfluidic channels and the sample evaporation during transport result in the low efficiency of sample delivery within the device the volume that reaches the detection zones verses the total volume within the device is usually less than in situations where the sample quantity is tiny or the sample is costly low volume sensors with more efficient sample delivery are desirable some hydrophobic agents for patterning devices cannot build hydrophobic barriers strong enough to withstand samples of low surface tension for example the hydrophobic areas of paper based microfluidic device which is fabricated with wax or akd do not allow the liquid penetration only when the surface tension of the liquid is higher than critical value when the surface tension of liquid is lower than that value g biological samples with surfactant liquid can penetrate not only within the hydrophilic channels but also in the hydrophobic areas of the device rendering the device ineffective for guided liquid transport this is because wax and akd hydrophobize paper by lowering the surface free energy of the paper not blocking the pores in paper the limit of the detection lod is usually high for the traditional colorimetric method integrated into the devices making the current paper based microfluidic devices insufficient for the analysis of samples of very low concentration for example the permitted maximum level of contaminants in drinking water or food is typically set in the ppb or even ppt range which may be undetectable by the conventional colorimetry these current limitations of paper based microfluidic devices will require further research to overcome to circumvent the above mentioned limitations number of studies have been conducted using alternative cheap materials fabrication techniques and detection methods for creating new types of low cost microfluidic systems tian et al designed the groove microfluidic devices by using non porous capillary channels to transport samples and paper like porous zones to detect samples compared to the porous paper channel the non porous groove channel on polymer film can significantly reduce sample retention and cause less chromatographic separation of the analytes in samples thus increasing the sample delivery efficiency li et al invented the low cost thread based microfluidic system with which the microfluidic devices were created by sewing threads through supporting substrate such as polymer film these devices have higher wet strength compared with paper based microfluidic devices and fluid mixing can be easily achieved by twining threads together as mixing microfluidic channel reches et al also reported using thread as an alternative material for fabricating low cost microfluidic systems several studies on bioactive paper have proposed few promising ideas to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of the colorimetric detection for paper based microfluidic devices one proposal is combining assay reagents with sol gel materials to immobilize reagents on paper in this way hossain et al developed paper based sensor which can detect organophosphate pesticides of nanomolar quantities in milk or lettuce by color changing another proposal is using gold nanoparticle aunp based colorimetric detection which can dramatically improve both the sensitivity and the specificity of detection zhao et al applied aunp colorimetric probe to paper based assays for detecting deoxyribonuclease and adenosine research on paper based microfluidic devices is still at an early stage significant research efforts will be needed in this field to nurture it into more matured platform technology in diagnostic point of care poc and environmental monitoring applications further exploratory studies will be seen which discover new concepts and capabilities of this technology whilst any individual researcher in this field may come up with list of potential future directions from their point of view here we hope to convey to readers few of the perspective directions which we think are relevant and attractive in this field although new fabrication methods of paper based microfluidic devices will continually be reported in future the practicality of the existing and future methods will be judged by the poc and diagnostic market in terms of the material and fabrication costs their potentials for mass productions their reliance upon any other equipment in order to function their reliability in providing easy to interpret assay results and their compatibility to telemedicine particularly with mobile phone transmission or interpretation of test results whilst major advantage of paper based microfluidics is that they can function in an equipment free fashion simple and portable result interpretation devices have been reported however paper based microfluidic devices that rely on complicated instrumentation for result interpretation may only have value for laboratory uses laboratories with experience in papermaking converting and printing technologies may in future play increasing roles in tailoring novel functionalized and bioactive paper substrates and mass fabrication processes to speed up the commercialization process of paper based microfluidic diagnostics for real poc and disease screening applications their expertise in controlling paper sheet structures incorporating new g nanocellulose fibres and biofunctional materials into sheets using polyelectrolytes and printing technology will significantly benefit the future development of paper based microfluidic technology to date most paper based microfluidic devices are made using filter papers in future other grades of papers that have certain unique properties can be used for making certain paper based devices for specific applications these new devices will have properties that cannot be provided by filter papers further research on mechanistic understanding of capillary wicking within paper sheets will be necessary for gaining more precise control of lateral flow in paper paper surface energy and structure may be the most relevant parameters which attract investigation also vertical flow in paper e liquid flow through the paper thickness through defined area in controllable rate may need investigation this is because diagnostic devices based on vertical sample flow are possible another reason is that paper based microfluidics will require the control of not only liquid lateral flow but also vertical flow novel signal display methods may attract investigation one of the possibilities for paper based microfluidics is to display the testing results in text since paper is inherently suited to displaying text text reporting is much more user friendly to untrained users of paperfluidic devices it is therefore useful field of research to explore although printing and displaying text using enzyme and other simple colorimetric chemistries on paper microfluidic devices have been shown to be possible studies of using text to report diagnostic results on paper are extremely rare the value of new technique or new product could only be embodied after it has been commercialized and accepted by the potential users similarly paper based microfluidics as new platform or system for liquid manipulation and sample detection will also need time to attest its real value to society  we report on the successful installation and operation of scanning transmission ray microspectroscope stxm at the pollux facility at the swiss light source this integration of an advanced stxm with improved sample handling capabilities and novel beamline provides unique capabilities pollux uses linearly or circularly polarized rays from bending magnet with an extended photon energy range ev it is therefore well suited to determine sample quantitative chemical composition molecular orientation or thickness of organic as well as condensed matter materials the local magnetic state of magnetic thin films is accessible through fast helicity switching by steering the electron beam off axis through the bending magnet ex vacuo girder movers allow fast and highly reproducible alignment of the instrument with respect to the photon beam the present spatial resolution is nm limited by the zone plates utilized the instrument has the stability and positional resolution to operate with much higher resolution optics as it becomes available in addition to characterization experiments we present several typical examples from materials research and environmental science to exemplify the capabilities the recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of new experimental techniques to investigate nanoscale materials with unprecedented resolution the various scanning probe techniques g scanning tunneling microscopy or atomic force microscopy afm and their related techniques have revolutionized modern surface and interface science allowing atomic resolution most of the investigations with afm often rely on the correlation with morphology electron microscopy can compete in terms of spatial resolution with the above mentioned scanning probe techniques and in the case of transmission electron microscopy tem is not limited to morphology information high resolution tem determines atomic positions in bulk with highest accuracy and full atomic resolution e it yields bulk information at ultimate spatial resolution however obtaining the morphological information is often insufficient and the electronic properties element composition chemical state and in some cases the magnetic properties of nanoscale materials have to be explored this requires the combination of high spatial resolution with detailed spectroscopic information based on their unique interaction with matter soft rays have developed into powerful tool to gain insight into the electronic properties and chemical or magnetic state in condensed matter usually the characteristic properties vary across the sample and the spatial distribution of these variations has to be investigated at sufficiently high spatial resolution soft ray absorption spectroscopy combined with high spatial resolution is an ideal tool for such tasks since it provides the necessary information with high sensitivity minimum sample preparation and flexibility of using broad range of environments such as magnetic fields liquids and gas flow in particular the near edge ray absorption fine structure nexafs shows superior sensitivity in organic materials since the excitations of electrons of the light elements carbon nitrogen and oxygen e the major constituents in organic molecules into unoccupied molecular orbitals electronic states are governed by the local chemical surrounding of the excited atom in order to achieve high spatial resolution in scanning transmission soft ray microspectroscopy fresnel zone plates fzps are commonly utilized to focus the rays to point focus images are formed from raster scanning the sample through the focal point while measuring the transmitted intensity itrans using an ray detector by varying the photon energy and the polarization or sample parameters such as the temperature multidimensional data set itrans y p is obtained by comparing the data to the well known absorption edges of the elements and to reference samples information about the elemental composition chemical bonding sample morphology and magnetic order can be obtained since the pioneering work of kirz and rarback several such scanning transmission ray microscope stxm instruments have been built and have thus become important tools for micro and nanocharacterization in material sciences and condensed matter research similar microspectroscopic experiments are also available in so called full field txms which reduce image acquisition times to seconds by transferring magnified two dimensional image onto charge coupled device ccd camera this requires different microscope scheme using condenser lens in front and magnifying micro fzp behind the sample spectroscopic imaging requires the use of an adequate monochromator as g presently used at bessy beamline the present paper describes the features of the present pollux stxm which is installed at bending magnet of the gev electron storage ring of the swiss light source sls villigen switzerland the pollux stxm is based on the stxm installed at bl of the advanced light source als berkeley usa but has several significant improvements it operates at an increased photon energy range from to ev since high energy grating has been implemented to the beamline thus offering improved conditions to investigate g transition metal samples the sls top up mode gives much higher stability to the electron beam allowing much higher integral count rates in addition the superior beam stability at the sls and the implemented feedback systems even allows one to control the local tilt of the storage ring orbit see sec ii this results in circularly polarized light which at present can be switched from left to right handed circularly polarized light with repetition rates of hz at present hz in near future without moving any of the position sensitive mirrors of the monochromator this operation mode will allow new experiments to explore magnetization dynamics in nanomagnetic materials based on the ray magnetic circular dichroism contrast further improvements include g ex vacuo girder movers to easily align the instrument with respect to the illuminating beam the successful installation of prototype stxm at the pollux facility has triggered the commercial availability of stxms to become widely distributed nanoanalysis tool in modern synchrotron research in summary the unique features of the pollux facility are as follows the alignment of the instrument with respect to the beamline is much easier faster and more flexible by the use of ex vacuo girder movers the interferometer resolution is improved over prior instruments allowing improved feedback and microscope stability due to the improved storage ring performance with respect to beam stability including fast forward feedback implementation and the use of top up injection at the sls storage ring pollux offers new opportunities such as routine operation of fast helicity switching presently hz in the future around hz or even faster which is an important prerequisite in micromagnetic analysis which in combination with time resolved studies will open new experimental analysis options this is novel feature unique to the pollux facility the vacuum in the stxm chamber is approximately three orders of magnitude lower thus enabling even secondary electron detection in addition pollux covers larger energy range than the als stxm and thus allows the characterization of much wider range of materials lastly superior spatial resolution has been demonstrated monochromator similar to the original concept of kirz and rarback the pollux instrument uses spherical grating monochromator with horizontal dispersion fresnel zone plate fzp an order selecting aperture osa and raster scanned sample the technical implementation is based on the design of the beamline stxm at the als the pollux instrument was designed as robust user friendly experiment providing large flexibility for different sample environments the source is bend magnet with critical energy of kev the optical principle of the beamline is shown in fig horizontally deflecting toroidal mirror creates horizontal focus of the bending magnet source at the entrance slit with magnification of mhor the monochromator with two spherical gratings and lines mm respectively in fixed mount disperses in the horizontal plane in the vertical direction the source is imaged by the toroidal mirror mvert onto the exit slit that is acting as secondary source for the fzp located downstream the details of the design and performance predictions are provided in ref the principle of the optical design follows concept developed at the als which demonstrated the possibility to build competitive stxm instrument at bending magnet without the complexity and costs of an insertion device beamline for maximum spatial resolution the exit slit must limit the illumination of the zone plate to the coherent fraction of the incident photon phase space this leads to the design of long beamline with small magnifications the fraction of the phase space of the source which cannot be coherently imaged by the zone plate is used to deliberately overfill the slits this improves the signal to noise ratio because it reduces the sensitivity to drifts and vibrations the entrance slit can be used to gain photon flux at the expense of energy resolution without sacrificing the spatial resolution which is only determined by the size of the exit slit and the properties of the zone plate compared to the als beamline pollux covers wider photon energy range that extends to ev this allows investigations on correlated electron systems cu edge gaas and its variants ga and as edges and on rare earth containing materials miv edges up to holmium the configuration of pollux also offers easy access to circularly polarized light in addition to the standard linear polarization enabling the investigation of magnetic materials circularly polarized light is obtained by controlled local tilt of the storage ring orbit new and unique feature which will be described in sec ii in the pollux monochromator the gratings rotate around the vertical axis formed by two flexure hinges the two gratings are mounted on single carriage allowing vertical translation guided by cross roller bearing stages they can be individually adjusted in four degrees of freedom rx ry rz allowing an alignment of the grating surface and grove orientation with respect to the rotation axis of the monochromator the grating rotation ry and translation are remotely controlled by motors and encoders located outside the vacuum details of the mechanical design and characterization are published by henein et al the vacuum separation between the stxm and the beamline is achieved by silicon nitride membrane si nm thick located just upstream of the fzp measurements with the stxm can then be either at atmospheric pressure air or he or in vacuum of mbar which is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than for the als stxms gas cell located between the exit slit and the si membrane is used for absolute calibration of the photon energy and for energy resolution measurements for this purpose nm thick al foil mounted in manual gate valve can be inserted which then separates the gas in the cell from the beamline vacuum monochromator number of photoion yield measurements at different absorption edges have been carried out using the gas cell in order to characterize the energy resolution of the beamline the well known s transition at about ev was used to optimize the energy resolution using the lines mm grating an example is shown in fig using equal slit widths of for and because of the intrinsic linewidth of the s transition the energy resolution is not simply given by the width of the peaks but must be estimated by the ratio of the third maximum to the first minimum as seen in fig this ratio is indicating resolving power above which is adequate for the nexafs spectroscopy experiments performed at pollux the relation between energy resolution and photon flux which is of interest for practical experiments is shown in fig for the lines mm grating the optical design allows trade off between photon flux and resolution by the settings of the exit slit opening and entrance slit as illustrated in fig the energy resolution can be degraded from value of e to value of e by opening the entrance slit parallel to the energy dispersion plane from to while maintaining the exit slit at nominal this is accompanied by an increase in the photon flux by factor of as shown to the right in fig assuming gaussian intensity distribution at we obtain the full width at half maximum fwhm horizontal focus at the entrance slit from the value of the relative intensity the experimental value of is in good agreement with the value of obtained from ray tracing the resolving power has been checked at other photon energies using other gases ar ev co and ev ev ne ev the results are shown at the very low energy end of the instrument for the ar absorption edge near ev using the lines mm grating fig and for the ne np absorption edge near ev using the lines mm grating fig the photon flux on the sample is shown in fig for typical experimental conditions to correctly measure it we include the absorption by the si vacuum window the zone plate and the order selecting aperture in addition we keep the spectral resolution constant by varying the width of the entrance slit and adjust for the energy dependant focal length of the fzp the photon flux at the sample was measured using the silicon photodiode which is one of the two standard detectors in the instrument the absorption edges of carbon ev nitrogen ev and oxygen ev result in local minima in the measurement because of contamination on the optical elements and absorption in the si membrane the small dip at ev is result of light absorbed by oxygen contamination due to second order contributions from the monochromator below ev calculations predict high contribution from third order light which is confirmed by the measurement this limits the useful range of the pollux experiment toward low photon energies the region beyond ev still provides reasonable flux that can be exploited for experiments polarization switching for ray circularly polarized light can be generated by localized angular tilt of the electron beam orbit within the dipole magnet here we introduce this tilt by means of vertical asymmetric bump produced by four successive dipole correctors which are part of the standard sls orbit correction system the maximum tilt amplitude is rad to compensate for the increase in the betatron coupling two skew quadrupoles up and downstream of the pollux dipole magnet are used presently the switching is done quasistatically switching time fast switching with an expected upper limit of about hz is presently being implemented the orbit bumps are invisible to other beamlines because any orbit deviations are compensated by the fast orbit feedback with an accuracy of few micrometers and up to cutoff frequency of hz the principle of polarization switching is sketched in fig where the upper panel shows the situation with which provides linear horizontal polarization the opening angle of the dipole radiation is and the beamline vertical acceptance is which is given by the opening of the entrance slit the lower panel shows the beam tilted downward by resulting in left circularly polarized light entering the beamline for the stxm beamline the usable vertical acceptance angle is limited by the vertical acceptance angle of the zone plate and can be calculated by dfzp fzp mvert rad where dfzp is the zone plate diameter fzp mm is the distance between exit slit and zone plate and mvert is the vertical magnification of the first mirror first results of magnetic imaging utilizing ray magnetic circular dichroism xmcd are presented in sec iii the pollux stxm was developed by collaboration of the als north carolina state university the university of erlangen rnberg the paul scherrer institut and the company accel bergisch gladbach germany the principle of the instrument is shown in fig the fzp focuses the soft ray light to diffraction limited spot higher diffraction orders are filtered out using an osa located between the fzp and the sample the sample consists of semitransparent silicon nitride membrane or tem grid on which the sample is mounted the intensity of the transmitted ray beam is measured by large mm area detector behind the sample at present two types of detectors are available photodiode and photomultiplier tube coupled to scintillator phosphor screen which converts the rays to visible light the photon energy dependent focal length of zone plate e is given by e dfzp ch for typical zone plate parameters outer diameter dfzp thinnest ring nm this corresponds to an energy dependent focal length of e e ev the osa is positioned so that it provides maximum rejection of higher diffraction orders both from the monochromator and the fzp and maximum transmission of first order light through its aperture of the distance between osa and the sample is then typically m at the s edge ev and at the fe edge ev the motorized degrees of freedom for the different components are shown in fig imaging of samples mounted on the piezonanoscanner stage is accomplished by raster scanning y const across the ray focus for spectroscopy the fzp is moved along the direction optical path to track the energy dependence of the focal length while the sample position is kept fixed to achieve the required spatial resolution tight control of the relative position of fzp and sample is necessary it is realized by closed loop optical interferometry the system used for pollux has increased resolution over the stxm agilent a together with deltatau pmac pci lite motion controller and offers therefore improved performance the quality of the mechanics and the control are demonstrated by the smallest features that have been resolved these are nm walls separating nm trenches in fzp used as test object which was imaged using fzp with nm outmost zone width to allow easy and reproducible positioning of the fzp with respect to the stationary ray beam the entire stxm is supported by five axis alignment system mounted outside of the vacuum chamber this mover system was originally designed for the girders of the sls storage ring it allows positioning along the and and rotation around the y and axes with micrometer precision over range of few millimeters for the rotation this corresponds to approximately microradiant precision and milliradiant range the precise alignment of the end station with respect to the photon source illuminating beam enables fast fzp exchange with minimum of downtime min the pollux stxm has been designed to allow operation in high vacuum turbomolecular pump mechanically isolated by bellow and mounted on an independent stand allows pressures down to mbar the vacuum chamber provides easy access for sample exchange as well as the facility to provide fluids gases and cooling and for connecting electrical signals it also provides ports for optical access which will be used for optical levitation of individual nano objects extra ports may be utilized to implement fast ccd camera thus offering simple implementation of differential phase contrast microscopy photographs of the pollux stxm are shown in fig soft ray stxm is an established technique for microspectroscopy of soft matter magnetic materials and environmental and geosciences as well as for biological imaging with the increasing number of instruments available more intense use is predicted and numerous new fields will make use of such type of microspectroscopy combining high spatial with high spectroscopic and even temporal resolution allows investigations of many properties relevant for micro and nanostructured materials the contrast in stxm is the spatially resolved ray transmission signal itrans which is given by itrans i exp e t where and itrans are the incident and transmitted ray intensities at position respectively the absorption coefficient depends on the polarization the photon energy and the atomic number the local thickness of the sample is r the sensitivity to the chemical elements comes primarily from the dependence of the absorption edges on the atomic number but variations in the chemical state lead to significant changes in the position and intensity of absorption peaks in the near edge region thus providing detailed information on the chemical bonding in the following we show several examples illustrating the wide range of scientific questions that can be investigated using the pollux beamline since pollux also provides circularly polarized light it can be used for xmcd experiments as an example we show results on copt multilayer sample the sample consists of multilayer structure of co and pt total co thickness nm on top of irmn film which induces an exchange bias it is known that copt forms wormlike domains magnetized perpendicular to the film plane an image of these magnetic domains is shown in fig they are visible as dark and bright regions of approximately nm width in the dichroic transmission signal ixmcd i i i i the co edge spectrum is shown in fig for helicity to check the effect of the bump angle quantitatively images were acquired as function of the analysis is shown in fig the magnetic contrast i i was calculated from the intensity on domain magnetized up and from domain magnetized down it increases linearly with the bump angle at rate of rad the relative intensity i falls off quadratically reflecting the beam profile folded with the acceptance of the beamline at the maximum available tilt angle rad the magnetic contrast is about when taking into account that the resonant absorption at the co edge of this sample tco nm is only about this corresponds to about effective dichroism in the co signal this value is surprisingly close to what can be obtained on beamlines using circularly polarized undulators indicating high degree of circular polarization setup to explore the magnetization dynamics with subnanosecond resolution is presently being developed during the past decade scanning transmission ray spectromicroscopy has been extensively used to study number of carbonaceous materials such as polymers biomolecules and soil colloids since nexafs spectroscopy at the carbon edge is measure of the geometric and electronic structure of the molecules using the characteristic s and resonances stxm can fingerprint the chemistry of carbon containing samples major advantages of the technique include the possibility to perform quantitative compositional and orientational analyses of organic nanomaterials in the following example we monitor the morphology and molecular orientation in ultrathin organic films fabrication of highly oriented and ordered films by controlled growth and the fundamental understanding of the interrelations between structural and electronic properties of such films are important for the future development of organic electronic devices in this example tetracyanoquinodimethane tcnq films were grown on silver covered si membranes by vacuum sublimation tcnq is good electron acceptor and is known to form radical anion transfer complexes with number of different metals these complexes show wide range of interesting electronic properties such as electrical conductivity and ferromagnetism vacuum deposition of tcnq on nm thick silver films leads to the formation of shaped agglomerations of nanocrystals which can be imaged using the pollux stxm as shown in fig when using photon energy of ev fig strong absorption from the tcnq crystallites is observed the macrocrystal seems to consist of platelike microcrystals that might be rotated with respect to each other at this photon energy the contrast is related to the sample thickness r which is approximately uniform as seen from the equal gray level of all crystallites in the image the rotation of the microcrystallites can be clearly discerned when using photon energy of ev fig since the light is linearly polarized linear horizontal we predominantly excite electrons into the unoccupied states this absorption depends strongly on the carbon double bond orientation as shown in fig the different gray levels of the microcrystals indicate the different orientations of their c double bonds in the constituting molecules local spectra acquired from microcrystallites of different orientations are shown in fig these local spectra confirm that the absorption is independent of crystallite orientation at ev while absorption differs clearly for differently oriented crystallites at ev according to simulations performed by sch ll the resonances denoted as b and in fig can be attributed to the following s excitations cyclohexadiene carbon bonds b carbene and substituted cyclohexadiene carbon bonds cyclohexadiene carbon and cyano group bonds d cyano group bond and substituted cyclohexadiene carbon bonds accordingly one can unambiguously conclude that the molecular plane of the tcnq molecules in the dark areas of the stxm imaged at ev are oriented upright with respect to the silver substrate whereas in the bright areas molecules lie mostly flat on the substrate thus stxm experiments with polarized lights allow the investigation of organic crystallites with resolution of several tens of nanometers in addition to identifying not only the size and size distribution of the microcrystallites but also their absolute molecular orientation to study samples with high vapor pressure under controlled gas atmosphere gas tight climate cell has been developed the cell is made from sandwich of two silicon wafers each thick fig both wafers have silicon nitride window of nm thickness in their center the sample is deposited on the front wafer while the back wafer closes the cell the custom made wafer at the back of the cell has two additional holes besides the main window which serve as inlet and outlet for the gas flow the sample space between the two wafers is sealed air tight using film of thick glue scotch art no to secure complete tightness the outside of the cell was sealed using rubber cement the cell is mounted on standard sample plate for the microscope which was modified to allow connection of the gas supply to the cell to minimize the ray absorption by the gas inside the microscope and the cell helium is used as buffer gas pressure atm the gas flow is controlled by mass flow controllers and was chosen as low as conveniently possible few ml min to avoid any movement of the sample or bending of the thin silicon nitride membranes prior to entering the cell the gas flow passes over ice or water film of variable temperature thereby controlling the humidity as proof of concept we have studied mixtures of an inorganic salt ammonium sulfate with an organic acid adipic acid two types of samples have been prepared first an aqueous solution of both substances was nebulized the aerosol was then dried and deposited on the upstream silicon nitride membrane typical stxm transmission image of an aerosol particle size approximately nm recorded at ev is shown in fig second an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate and adipic acid was brought onto membrane dried and mounted to such cell in fig we demonstrate the response of the k edge nexafs spectra to change in humidity in the cell for humidity well below the deliquescence humidity of ammonium nitrate relative humidity the spectrum remains unchanged once the relative humidity is above the deliquescence point the spectral changes reflect both the uptake of water and the phase transition from the solid ammonium sulfate into an aqueous ammonium sulfate solution the morphology of diesel and wood smoke soot particles is very similar they are generally smaller than nm and consist of chains of primary particles with graphitic structure see figs and diesel and wood combustion emission samples can however be distinguished based on the known k edge nexafs of bulk material characteristic resonances in the spectra allow for direct molecular speciation of the graphitelike solid core surface functional groups and aromatic and aliphatic components depending on the origin of the soot with stxm it is possible to gain more detailed information on the variation in chemical structure of single soot particles we were able to obtain clear spectra of particles as small as nm by averaging data of line scans with nm step size and ms dwell time diesel soot particles fig contain dominant spectral signature at ev stemming from unsaturated multiple carbon bonds and shoulder in the spectrum at ev from equivalent c bonds from the graphitic core the spectra from graphite also show these features confirming the partial graphitic nature of diesel soot the spectra of wood soot have less graphitic nature but show peak at ev from oh bonds see fig these source specific signatures allowed discrimination between wood and diesel soot particles in an ambient air sample collected next to an arterial road in zurich fig the spectrum of particle shows the characteristics of diesel combustion source and the spectrum of particle that of wood combustion additional peaks are found for example between and ev in particle however the spectra obtained from the atmospheric particles do not completely match the diesel and wood soot spectra most probably this is due to the particle aging e reaction with atmospheric gases and adsorption of new species in order to investigate this question the effects of particle weathering by ozone are being conducted at present examination of gas filled microballoons in water gas encapsulated microballoons are of interest as contrast enhancers for ultrasound diagnostics and or as carriers of therapeutic gases very recently the pollux stxm has been utilized for the first spectromicroscopy examination of gas filled microballoons in aqueous solution because the water in which the microballoons are suspended only weakly absorbs rays in the photon energy range between and ev ray microspectroscopy of such objects in their natural water environment is very useful and an important tool for the development of applications in the present example stable air filled poly vinyl alcohol pva coated microballoons were prepared by cross linking telechelic pva at the water air interface stxm measurements were performed using wet cell containing approximately of water microballoon suspension sandwiched between two si membranes of nm thickness sealed with high vacuum grease to maintain the water environment during stxm investigation figure shows transmission images of microballoons in water environment recorded at ev and ev the absorption contrast in fig below the oxygen edge ev is due to the strong absorption of the rays by the carbonaceous material whereas the water and air have only weak absorption at this photon energy above the oxygen edge ev the transmission changes drastically the inside of the microballoons stays transparent white while the surrounding water turns absorbing dark this is due to the high oxygen absorption in water and the low absorption in air primarily due to their density differences as one can see the image shows some variations between the particles namely differences in the polymeric shell thickness and different absorptions from the internal part of the microballoons moreover the microballoon labeled shows almost the same absorption signal as the surrounding water at ev see fig this suggests that microballoon is filled with water finding that is corroborated by the oxygen edge nexafs spectra the absorption spectra extracted from line scans across the inner part of particles and are compared in fig a nexafs spectrum acquired from the surrounding water is also shown in this figure the spectrum from microballoon shows essentially the same resonances as the water spectrum except small intensity decrease in the feature at ev and an intensity increase in the peak at ev this result explicitly suggests the presence of water inside the balloon in contrast to the spectra of the surrounding water and to particle the nexafs spectrum of microballoon shows strong resonance at ev which is assigned to the s o transition originating from the carbonyl groups of the telechelic pva shell furthermore the water peak at ev is absent in this spectrum while the main s resonance appears at around ev hence the nexafs spectrum of microballoon shows only the resonances typical for the telechelic pva shell this result strongly suggests that microballoon is air filled the new pollux facility at the swiss light source allows soft ray microspectroscopic experiments on wide range of materials with both high spatial and spectral resolutions by using two gratings in spherical grating monochromator an extended energy range from to ev is covered the obtainable spectral resolution is at least e at ev circularly polarized soft rays can be obtained by inducing controlled vertical tilt of the electron beam in the dipole magnet this tilt is fully compensated within the sector of the electron storage ring and invisible to other beamlines the pollux instrument uses interferometric control of the relative position between the fzp and the sample to maintain complete registry of the y coordinates as function of photon energy its imaging performance is evidenced by the smallest structures resolved which are test patterns with nm lines followed by nm trenches because of its flexible sample environment which includes heating cooling gas and liquid cells and electrical connections to the outside the pollux stxm offers very wide variety of experiments from hard and soft condensed matter as well as in environmental science and biology  we report model describing the molecular orientation disorder in ch nh pbi solving classical hamiltonian parametrised with electronic structure calculations with the nature of the motions informed by ab initio molecular dynamics we investigate the temperature and static electric field dependence of the equilibrium ferroelectric molecular domain structure and resulting polarisability rich domain structure of twinned molecular dipoles is observed strongly varying as function of temperature and applied electric field we propose that the internal electrical fields associated with microscopic polarisation domains contribute to hysteretic anomalies in the current voltage response of hybrid organic inorganic perovskite solar cells due to variations in electron hole recombination in the bulk solar cells based on hybrid organic inorganic perovskites display unusual device physics which is still in the process of being understood one unusual aspect is the notable hysteresis in current voltage curves depending on rate of measurement and starting point within the curve when the solar cell is held at short circuit in the dark or light the photovoltaic performance decreases considerably when the photovoltaic cell is operating at near open circuit voltage performance builds the highest apparent efficiencies are produced after tempering the solar cell in forward bias at similar behaviour is observed in both mesoporous and planar solar cell architectures and independent of the presence of hole transport layer g spiromeotad this effect is strongest in planar device architectures as would be expected if it resulted from the electric field applied between the contacts this behaviour occurs over time scales up to hundreds of seconds perovskite abx structured materials tend to have large dielectric constant due to the relative ease of polarising the cell structure in particular distortion of the edge sharing bx octahedra can produce an overall electric dipole between the and lattice sites inorganic perovskites are known to exhibit range of ferroelectric and ferroelastic phase transitions the hybrid perovskite analogues are formed by replacing the element at the icosahedral site with an isovalent molecule in this work we study the photovoltaic absorber methyl ammonium lead iodide ch nh pbi mapi here documentclass pt minimal begin document rm ch rm nh end document ch nh ma is singly charged closed shell molecular cation as compared to inorganic perovskites the hybrid materials have lower crystal symmetry and the possibility of dipolar cation interactions gives rise to strong low frequency dielectric screening and the formation of polarised domain structures ferroelectric materials have been studied in the context of photovoltaic applications for over half century number of effects have been attributed to the lack of centrosymmetry the anomalous photovoltaic effect was first reported in samples of pbs in and was subsequently linked to the existence of ferroelectric transition resulting in large photovoltages ca kv similar effects have been reported for ferroelectric phases of sbsi zns and cdte additionally oxide perovskites such as batio and knbo demonstrate bulk photovoltaic effect in these materials photocurrents can be generated in the absence of asymmetric electrical contacts unlike standard photovoltaic cells in this letter we report the implementation of classical monte carlo simulation of the domain behaviour arising from molecular rotation in hybrid perovskites the model takes parameters from density functional theory dft calculations using both static lattice and molecular dynamic md simulations in this work we restrict ourselves to the two dimensional case and allow the dipoles to freely rotate no cage strain is applied we propose that the ma ions in this material are highly rotationally mobile the interaction between these ions forms ordered domains which respond slowly to applied electric fields which results in structured local potential field we speculate that the equilibrium open circuit configuration is beneficial for solar cell operation by reducing charge carrier recombination through interpenetrating percolating pathways of electric potential valleys and ridges for holes and electrons at short circuit the electric field resulting from the built in voltage is sufficient to disrupt this structure suppressing long range order and resulting in more isolated domains the existence of intricate dipole phase behaviour and the resultant structure in internal electric fields indicate that these photoferroic characteristics atypical of standard photovoltaic materials must be considered in device modelling low frequency dielectric behaviour the dielectric response of ch nh pbi and related hybrid perovskites exhibits significant temperature and frequency dependence at low temperatures there is discontinuity associated with the first order phase transition between the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases ca at higher temperatures the orientation of ma becomes partially disordered work by poglitsch and weber in measured the complex dielectric response of methyl ammonium lead halides iodide chloride bromide as function of temperature between and the effective dielectric constant at was measured to be for ch nh pbi at frequency of ghz in onoda yamamuro et al reported value of ca at frequency of khz in contrast the static dielectric constant in the absence of molecular reorientation is predicted to be from electronic structure calculations pbesol qsgw which is in good agreement with the value of determined from fit of permittivity measurements over to the kirkwood fr hlich equation the unusual dielectric behaviour will make analysis of impedance measurements on photovoltaic cells challenging ab initio molecular dynamics an open question in these materials is the alignment and dynamics of the ma ion analysis of and nmr spectra confirmed that ma cation rotation is rapid process at room temperature ray diffraction has been used to characterise the low temperature orthorhombic pna v symmetry room temperature tetragonal mcm h symmetry and above room temperature cubic pm oh symmetry crystal structures of mapi the position of the ma molecules is usually described with partial occupancies that satisfy the space group symmetry g in the cubic phase eight identical positions can be fitted around the standard documentclass pt minimal begin document frac frac frac end document perovskite site each occupied with equal probability there is distinct first order orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition but the tetragonal to cubic transition is close to second order with no change in pseudo cubic cell volume it should be noted that in hybrid perovskite thin films analysis of ray scattering data and electron microscopy has suggested the presence of lower symmetry nanostructure as well as the appearance of the cubic phase at room temperatures to provide atomistic insight without the assumption or restriction of lattice symmetry beyond periodic supercell atom expansion of the pseudo cubic perovskite structure we investigate the energetics and dynamics of ma in mapi with ab initio md simulations based on the pbesol exchange correlation functional we employ timestep of fs which is sufficient to describe even the h vibrations the md trajectory at contains large scale fluctuation of the ions about their equilibrium positions including rapid rotation of the methyl group and total rotation of the methyl ammonium ion video file of the trajectory is provided elsewhere the hybrid perovskites are structurally soft materials so far almost all published calculations and analysis have assumed perfect crystals while these data indicate that such structures are not representative of the materials at room temperature further structural analysis is on going due to the permanent molecular dipole of the methyl ammonium ion its ensemble average position and the dynamics of its movements are of interest in explaining the dielectric response and electrical behaviour of devices made from mapi custom codes were written to analyse the md trajectories identifying the n bonds across the periodic boundaries and calculating this molecular alignment of the eight ma ions relative to the pseudo cubic unit cell the distribution of spherical coordinates over the md ensemble enables us to make statements about the average distribution of molecular direction relative to the crystallographic unit cell here the histogram is in binned in spherical angles and hence the bins are not constant solid angle the oh symmetry of the ideal cubic perovskite phase leads to fold reduction of the phase space onto its reflection domain when we plot the data without considering the symmetry of the ma ion environment figure there is little that we can say other than preference for the ion to align with the faces of the cube the limited simulation time leads to the evident incomplete coverage of spherical phase space therefore we reflect the data onto the first octant and further exploit symmetry to reduce the internal coordinates to contain the domain between the unique faces edges and diagonals figure to increase the signal to noise ratio by factor of see the supplementary material for more details this reveals high density of ensembles in distribution around facial alignment lowered distribution around edge alignment and an increased distribution in disordered halo around diagonal alignment we can further quantify these distributions by binning the ensemble of symmetry reduced alignment vectors by whether they are nearest in angle to the face edge or diagonal vectors doing so we find that the raw densities are face edge and diagonally aligned populations due to the symmetry of these orientations with and fold degeneracy respectively and the boundaries between these domains these populations are not directly comparable the solid angles they cover are different therefore we weight these distributions with surface areas evaluated from flat spherical distribution calculated with monte carlo integration of points using the same codes these densities which would be equal if there was no orientation preference are face edge and diagonal aligned while ab initio md is powerful approach the two principle limitations due to computational expense are finite size effects as the simulation is infinitely periodic on nm and short timescale ps are insufficient for diffusion processes to access the time and length scales necessary to represent realistic non equilibrium structures and so directly compare to experiment we construct classical model for molecular dipole interactions polar molecules on lattice we start from the lattice dynamical theory of ferroelectricity see anderson and cochran we limit ourself to assuming that the dominant soft phonon mode in the system is the free rotation of the molecular dipole within an extended perovskite cage structure the treatment of polarisation as an effect of rotational brownian motion is analytically challenging here we simulate these physics numerically by using monte carlo method to calculate the equilibrium configuration of the dipoles the macroscopic response of the material is expected to be linked to very slow rearrangements of domain walls as result of statistically rare cooperative rearrangements of the microscopic dipoles therefore we need to integrate long way in simulation time to equilibrate the material we construct model hamiltonian for the

interaction between unshielded methyl ammonium dipoles at the unit cell spacing of this energy is mev which we take in this work as exactly kbt k from here we take allowing the dipoles to freely rotate without frustration equilibrium behaviour at room temperature the domain structure of an equilibrated film with zero applied field is shown in figure twinning of the ma dipoles occurs to minimise the free energy this leads to aligned domains along the square axes as cofacial alignment minimises the dipole dipole distance compared to diagonal visualising the resulting dipole potential that comes from this alignment we observe the presence of structured interpenetrating regions of high and low electric potential following the features in the domain boundaries the temperature dependence of the domain structure is shown in figure at a striped anti ferroelectric phase is favoured which becomes increasingly disordered as the temperature increases due to the role of configuration entropy the room temperature phase could be viewed as superparaelectric consisting of randomly oriented linear ferroelectric domains while the domains are broken to give paraelectric phase at the effective simulation temperature varies linearly with respect to the hamiltonian interaction energies as our model currently has point dipole approximated interaction energy and ignores energetic contributions from the cage strain or ion inertia freely rotating dipoles simulation temperature cannot be expected to correspond directly to physical temperature electric field dependence of polarisation for solar cell to operate the electrical contacts must be selective difference in work function must exist between the front and back contacts this selectivity induces built in potential that at short circuit or in the dark results in an electric field across the device which acts to sweep out generated charge current collection at short circuit is therefore generally maximised here we assume that the perovskite solar cells without intentional doping are i type the potential drops linearly across the active material producing constant electric field when voltage is applied in forward bias it works to counteract this built in field at the maximal power point for relatively optimal solar cell material such as mapi the operating voltage is close to the open circuit voltage which is close to the built in potential and so only small electrical field will apply across the device in typical perovskite solar cells the layer thickness is of order hundreds of nanometres and the built in voltage of in the absence of charge equalisation effects this results in an electric field of mv across the hybrid perovskite the interaction energy of the ma dipole with this field is p mev for upper limit field strength of mv this is relatively small perturbation compared to the dipole dipole interaction of mev the alignment of the dipoles as result of the applied field is shown in figure the dipoles rearrange to partially counteract the applied field the response in overall dipole alignment is in the direction of the field versus background fluctuation for no applied field we emphasise that it took monte carlo moves per lattice site to achieve this equilibrium structure well beyond where total energy and debye polarisation appeared to have approached their equilibrium asymptotes though such small perturbation from the built in field exhibits negligible visual effect on the alignment figure top the effect on the dipole potential figure middle is strong leading to deeper more segregated regions of positive and negative potential we quantitatively evaluate the change in the structure of the dipole potential by two dimensional fourier transform figure bottom here we see that the zero field open circuit equilibrium structure is equally distributed in both axes and the density along the origin indicating the presence of linear features we interpret these short circuit features as being the development of carrier traps by the dipole domain response to the built in field at open circuit the extended ridges and valleys in potential could act as channels in which charge transport can take place understanding the true role of these features and quantifying the effect on device performance will require sophisticated device model and an improved understanding of the nature of charge carriers and charge transport in this class of materials particularly the size of the carrier polarons in these materials will heavily affect the influence of such local inhomogeneiity in the electrostatic potential on charge transport the fr hlich coupling constant is estimated to be using published band parameters for mapi and longitudinal optical phonon frequency of thz this indicates an intermediate electron lattice coupling phonon dressing leading to increase in the effective mass by the feynman variational treatment the electron and hole polaron radii would correspond to approximately perovskite unit cells sufficiently small to be influenced by inhomogeneity in the local electrostatic potential we predict we therefore consider it plausible that such variations in electrostatic potential will drive both carrier polaron segregation open circuit dipole structure and trapping short circuit dipole structure leading to increased bulk recombination at short circuit recently we have been made aware of inverted mapi perovskite cell designs capped with fullerene electron accepting layer which exhibit reduced hysteresis we interpret this as result of gaps in the mapi film resulting in high penetration of the fullerene forming heterojunction this effectively quenches the recombination as electron extraction into the fullerene phase out competes recombination in comparison to fullerene tio is poor slow electron acceptor additional ferroelectric contributions beyond molecular dipole reorientations additional ferroelectric contributions include distribution of free carriers electrons and holes as well as rotations and titling of the documentclass pt minimal begin document rm pbi end document pbi cage structure the formation of points defects including documentclass pt minimal begin document rm end document defect complexes and charged pb vacancies have been suggested which may also respond to an applied electric field previous impedance analysis have also suggested room temperature ionic conductivity in these materials under short circuit conditions the mapi layer will be polarised due to the alignment of dipoles as demonstrated in our simulations if the system is then placed in open circuit conditions the polarisation of mapi is removed however the depolarisation field consisting of charge carriers will take time to re equilibrate there will necessarily be feedback between the ferroelectric domain structure slower process and carrier distribution faster process therefore causing further hysteretic contribution to current voltage measurements additionally the electric field across the absorber under short circuit conditions would lead to an alignment of the cage polarisation rotation and titling and domain structure present in the hybrid perovskite film which is likely to be over longer time scale than the dipole reorientation the realignment of these domains upon removal or reversal of the field is another possible source of hysteresis in this work we have shown through ab initio molecular dynamics that the methyl ammonium ion is rotationally mobile in hybrid perovskites at room temperature and that the material is structurally soft this material behaviour may be fortuitous in terms of facilitating transport across grain boundaries when combined with the calculated large polaron transport and small effective masses the large site variation of the ions deserves further study in terms of its effect on material polarisation and ferroelectric response further investigation of the molecular dynamics will include expanding the simulation volume and analysing the trajectories further additional work with the monte carlo codes are required to extend the simulation to three dimensional perovskite volumes introduce other move types such as movement of ions both within the lattice cells and as net migration through the film and extend the simulated experiments to other relevant device physics more sophisticated interaction terms for the molecular cations would increase the expected accuracy of these codes in conclusion we have investigated the behaviour of the dipolar methyl ammonium cation in ch nh pbi using numerical simulations which have provided insights into the domain structure and polarisation fields which will be important for developing quantitative models to explain the unusual device physics of hybrid perovskite solar cells computational details the set up for density functional theory dft calculations of the primitive unit cells of ch nh pbi with range of molecular orientations including structure optimisation and static dielectric response as well as the lattice polarisation and barriers to rotation have been previously reported these were taken as the starting point for the md simulations in this study molecular dynamics md finite temperature newtonian md simulations were performed based on the atomic forces calculated at each timestep using dft point sampling with the pbesol functional and ev plane wave cutoff the starting configuration was fully relaxed pseudo cubic supercell with k grid with ma ions aligned along the direction spin orbit coupling is not treated primarily due to the prohibitive computational expense as orbital occupation is not changed for the undoped system the effect on the atomic forces is expected to be negligible trajectory data were collected every integration steps fs nos thermostat canonical ensemble was used with nos mass of custom codes were written for the analysis with the help of the mdanalysis library total of ps frames of data was used for analysis after an equilibration run of ps this generated unique ma alignment vectors monte carlo mc the mc implementation uses mersenne twister pseudo random number generator the code is serial running at on modest hardware but efficient uses of computational resources is achieved by making ensemble runs with gnu parallel the modestly sized simulations presented here can be extended up to full device sized simulations with well defined statistics over ensemble runs the initial state is lattice of randomised dipoles the resulting classical hamiltonian dipole monte carlo code starrynight is available as source code repository on github codes to interpret the ab initio molecular dynamics used in the production of this paper are similarly available  concentrated solar energy has become the input for an increasing number of experimental and commercial thermal systems over the past years thirugnanasambandam et al renewable sustainable energy rev recent papers have indicated that the addition of nanoparticles to conventional working fluids e nanofluids can improve heat transfer and solar collection tyagi et al sol energy eng e phelan et al annu rev heat transfer this work indicates that power tower solar collectors could benefit from the potential efficiency improvements that arise from using nanofluid working fluid notional design of this type of nanofluid receiver is presented using this design we show theoretical nanofluid enhancement in efficiency of up to as compared to surface based collectors when solar concentration ratios are in the range of furthermore our analysis shows that graphite nanofluids with volume fractions on the order of or less are suitable for mwe power plants experiments on laboratory scale nanofluid dish receiver suggest that up to increase in efficiency is possible relative to conventional fluid if operating conditions are chosen carefully lastly we use these findings to compare the energy and revenue generated in conventional solar thermal plant to nanofluid based one it is found that mwe capacity solar thermal power tower operating in solar resource similar to tucson az could generate million more per year by incorporating nanofluid receiver due to its attractive economics and the possibility of storage solar thermal energy is garnering significant interest and investment in order to deliver high quality energy to make electricity sunlight must be efficiently concentrated absorbed e converted to heat and delivered to thermal plant this paper will discuss the feasibility of using directly absorbing nanofluid to improve the efficiency of the receiver critical part of the system the basic concept of using particles to collect solar energy was studied in the by hunt and abdelrahman et al who mixed particles into gaseous working fluid in the past years or so particle receivers have been extensively modeled and several prototype collectors have been built and tested however most of this work was devoted to finding reversible chemical reactions many times in gas phase to generate hydrogen or some other chemical fuel this study on the other hand examines direct conversion of light energy to useful heat by mixing small amounts of nanoparticles by volume with conventional base liquid nanoparticles provide the following possible advantages in solar power plants the extremely small size of the particles ideally allows them to pass through pumps and plumbing without adverse effects nanofluids can absorb energy directly skipping intermediate heat transfer steps the nanofluids can be optically selective e high absorption in the solar range and low emittance in the infrared more uniform receiver temperature can be achieved inside the collector reducing material constraints enhanced heat transfer via greater convection and thermal conductivity may improve receiver performance and absorption efficiency may be enhanced by tuning the nanoparticle size and shape to the application the co authors have shown theoretically and experimentally that in low temperature solar collectors efficiency can be improved by using nanofluids this paper will extend that concept to high temperature nanofluid solar thermal collector the central questions of this study are as follows is it possible to achieve these enhancements without adversely affecting other parts of the system pumping costs or too much addition capital expense furthermore for given conceptual design what if any improvement is expected compared to conventional solar thermal collector to answer these comparisons are made using numerical modeling of the radiative transfer equation as presented in sec ii these questions are also explored through experimentation on small nanofluid dish collector simple economic analysis is conducted to illustrate the implications of using nanofluid collector the nanofluid since there are no commercial nanofluid solar collectors yet this section will outline our assumptions reasoning and choices made in designing one as mentioned above nanofluids are mixture of very small sized particles and the conventional liquids used in given application therefore the first design choices to be made are in selecting those two components common base liquids in solar collectors are water heat transfer oil or molten salt the choice between these liquids is usually determined by the required operating temperatures heat transfer oils are commonly used for medium temperature ranges c which are suitable for rankine thermal cycles and are our choice for this study for efficient solar collection the particles need to be highly absorptive which limits our study to metallic and graphite particles we will further limit our options by only selecting particles that are widely available off the shelf and are thus made in larger production volumes for instance some nanopowders can now be found for around kg of course gold platinum palladium and other precious metals fit this criterion but are not cost effective note all amounts are given in s note also that gold nanopowder is or about five times its bulk price the volume fraction of nanoparticles in the base fluid must be chosen carefully to get the most out of nanofluid if the nanoparticle concentration is too high all the sunlight will be absorbed in thin layer near the surface of the receiver e not volumetrically if the concentration is too low significant portion of the light will be transmitted out of the fluid ideally the least amount of particles needed to effectively absorb light will be used to minimize cost it should also be noted that much research has gone into finding additives and treatments ph buffers surfactants chemical treatments etc that will create stable nanofluid therefore we will assume here that it is possible to attain nanofluid that has long term stability for simplicity we will set scale boundaries by considering two plant sizes and mwe this range is used in order to analyze utility scale power systems and also to stay in range where they might feasibly be built or retrofitted in the near term trough e linear focus systems are poor choice for nanofluids because relatively large amount of surface area would require modification this study will consider only relatively high concentration e spot focus schemes of solar thermal electrical generation this choice was made to ensure that the change from conventional to nanofluid receiver would require only small changes in materials when compared to the entire solar collection system figure gives two notional designs of potential nanofluid receiver designated as and raw materials needed for this design are steel high temperature insulation and possibly glazing g antireflective float glass see techspec from edmund optics inc east gloucester pike barrington nj usa receiver with glazing could be oriented vertically or horizontally and operated at pressures well above ambient ideally the cold inlet stream could be directed toward the glazing to improve efficiency and to lance nanoparticles off the glazing to preserve transparency receiver could work in beam down concentrator under atmospheric pressure since the fluid is not confined receiver could also be turned on its side where the fluid flow would be falling film the advantage of receiver is that it could avoid the reflective losses of the glazing lastly fig gives simplified schematic of conventional power tower solid surface absorber the conventional power tower receiver is composed of wire ceramic mesh used to absorb energy over finite depth this type of receiver is sometimes referred to as volumetric absorber but it must still transfer heat through solid surface via conduction and convection to the working fluid that is the energy must go through at least one intermediate heat transfer step figure compares the heat transfer process of surface based collector and volumetric based collector in terms of their thermal resistance networks according to this simple model with all things being equal volumetric receiver should provide less resistance in converting sunlight into useful heat there are several interesting differences between conventional receiver and our conceptual nanofluid receiver the nanofluid receiver may unavoidably require transparent glazing to contain high temperature pressure fluid however the glazing material could be shaped to employ secondary optics the nanofluid by skipping conduction convection heat transfer step could avoid significant temperature drop and some heat loss the nanofluid receiver may require more maintenance and or somewhat higher capital expenditure an equivalent solar collector must have more tightly controlled optics flow conditions and receiver geometry finally thermal optical properties and thus receiver efficiencies are expected to be different from surface absorber this is modeled in secs iii vii nanofluid to determine how large scale solar collector might perform without actually building it we must employ model for this paper general nanofluid model developed by the co authors as described in ref is used the model is coupled solution of the radiative transfer equation and energy equation and is briefly described in sec iv in short the optical properties of small particles which are relatively far apart can be found without too much difficulty after some calculation the extinction coefficient can be found such that f bulk f dp fv that is is function of the complex refractive index bulk of the bulk particle material the complex refractive index of the base fluid f particle size dp wavelength and the volume fraction fv commonly available nanoparticles are in the range of nm for this study we will assume nm average diameter particles to limit the number of variables synthetic heat transfer fluid commonly used in solar systems therminol vp eutectic mixture of diphenyl oxide and biphenyl is used as the base fluid in this analysis because of its ability to remain liquid at elevated temperatures also we have limited our analysis to aluminum copper graphite and silver nanoparticles with the exception of silver these materials are relatively cheap and have high complex component of the refractive index e their extinction coefficients are proportionally high silver was also chosen because it has very high absorption peak due to plasmon resonance near sunlight peak irradiance using these assumptions extinction coefficients versus wavelength are plotted for selected nanofluids in fig note that volume fractions were chosen to absorb of incoming solar power in receiver depth of cm these results also take into account the fact that the size of these particles is on the order of the mean free path size of electrons that is we must account for the fact that we are using bulk material properties for nanoscale materials simple drude model as described in ref is used to change the optical properties by adding in damping coefficient to electron oscillations dependent on the particle size essentially this added step broadens the absorption peaks for small particles and slightly lowers them one major loss of energy in the receiver is from reflections from the surface of the absorbing fluid in order to make sure that this is not major drawback we modeled the reflectivity using the maxwell garnett effective medium theory next reflectance at the fluid interface simplified for normal incident light can be found the following equations are used eff eff fv f f in this expression and fv are the dielectric constant and the volume fraction respectively where the subscripts eff and define the effective medium what we are solving for the fluid and the particles respectively once we know the properties for the effective medium we can apply the following fresnel equation to estimate reflectance assuming light is near normal incidence n eff air eff air in this expression is the refractive index and is used to represent reflectance and distinguish it from thermal resistance also the subscripts eff and air denote the effective nanofluid and air respectively it should be noted that any variation due to temperature is neglected in these calculations these reflectance results are compared in fig to selective surface absorber these results show that according to our model an unglazed nanofluid receiver would actually lose less of the incoming radiation to reflections than selective coating note that the nanofluid materials have essentially coincident curves over the solar spectrum in fig nanofluid thermal emission however is much higher than selective surface especially for graphite this means that adding glazing that traps long wavelength infrared emission would be advantageous hence glazing gives slight increase in total reflection over the whole spectrum compared to selective surface but the reduction in radiative losses easily make up for it of course these reflective losses are only part of the optical losses that add up to derate solar receivers dust optical aberrations limitations in the mirrors etc will most likely add to account for large share of the losses in optical efficiency system optical efficiencies are usually at best for new clean optics after the optical properties are found we can numerically approximate the efficiency of solar receiver this is done as illustrated in fig by assuming that concentrated light enters from the top of the receiver where it is absorbed scattered converted to heat and carried out by flowing nanofluid some of the light energy is lost to reflection while heat is lost on the boundaries of the receiver due to convection and radiation characteristic temperature field inside the receiver is also shown in fig absorption of light is modeled inside the receiver with the following one dimensional radiative transport equation dii dy ib y ii where is the spectral absorption coefficient the subscript is used to keep track of which direction light is propagating e either incoming or outgoing light as described in ref the boundary conditions are as follows l ib l i s i for these equations we need to know the spectral reflectance of the wall and the glazing and respectively and the spectral radiation incident on the receiver the spectral wall emittance is also needed we also assume incoming light to be blackbody radiation t hc exp hc kbt where is the planck constant kb is the boltzmann constant and is the speed of light to model the temperature profile we couple the above equations with the following two dimensional energy equation and its boundary conditions the equations necessary for this model are as follows t qr cpu x y t tinlet l qr k y l where cp and are the fluid thermal conductivity density specific heat and velocity respectively to simplify the model the velocity profile is assumed constant e plug flow furthermore we also assume an overall loss coefficient which combines convection and radiation at the boundary to be in the range of m depending on the fluid temperature finally we shall define receiver efficiency as rec cp tout tin cgtar where cp tout tin are the mass flow rate specific heat and outlet and inlet temperatures of the fluid respectively also gt and are the concentration ratio the solar irradiance and the collector area respectively it should be noted that gt is calculated from the results of eq the interested reader can find more details on this model developed by the co authors in refs and once the general model is developed it is simply matter of conducting parametric study to examine how the solar receiver and power plant system efficiencies vary in the following analysis we have chosen to study the following important independent variables particle material particle volume fraction mass flow rate and solar concentration ratio first we will compare our chosen nanofluids while holding mass flow rate and solar concentration ratio constant at kg and suns respectively another important parameter that must be chosen is the reflectivity of the backing material which in this case was milled aluminum rav to match with the experimental work described in the following sections for these conditions fig plots the system efficiency versus the percent of transmitted direct normal irradiance e versus the total percent of solar power left after one pass through the nanofluid system efficiency as noted in the figure is defined as follows system tcth rec equation multiplies the receiver efficiency rec by carnot heat engine and which runs at efficiency figure shows that minor differences of less than in system efficiencies are obtained with different nanofluids for comparable sunlight absorption the differences that are present in system efficiency presumably result from spectral differences in the nanofluid extinction coefficient and scattering for example the extinction coefficient of graphite comes almost entirely from absorption e that is graphite scatters very little incident light and thus it has slightly higher system efficiency for most conditions in addition graphite has relatively uniform extinction coefficient as function of wavelength which also separates it from the metals figure also shows that there is an optimum nanoparticle volume fraction for each fluid which will achieve maximum system efficiency in this analysis the optimum point occurs when of the incident light is absorbed on the first pass with most of the remainder being absorbed on the semiabsorbing back or as reflected light goes back up through the fluid in general absorbing the light away from the boundaries where heat can be lost provides the best result the exact nanoparticle volume fraction however should be found for individual applications as it depends on parameters such as flow rate solar irradiance heat loss conditions reflectivity of the backing material receiver geometry and ambient conditions as baseline case the receiver geometry and approximate operating conditions e geometry and concentration ratio range are fixed to be roughly comparable to abengoa ps power tower in seville spain under normal conditions the ps produces about mw thermal power mwe with steam at bars which is roughly similar to the nanofluid results to highlight the comparison between our nanofluid model and the ps power plant its system efficiency is plotted as straight line in fig in the end the cheapest stable nanofluid should be the choice for solar thermal power plant according to our analysis in large scale system this is likely graphite at nearly in bulk with volume fraction on the order of or less it should be noted however that the price difference between nanoparticles may be negligible with respect to system capital costs now we shall consider the effect of varying the solar concentration ratio and the mass flow rate while holding particle material and volume fraction constant figure shows receiver efficiencies as function of solar concentration ratio in order to meet and outlet temperature constraints proper mass flow rate must be found by running the model several times to find each data point it should be noted that in most cases flow rates end up being in the fully turbulent regime e reynolds numbers ranging from to however pumping power from frictional losses is calculated to be negligible less than of the power plant electrical output since the receiver length is relatively short also an upper limit on temperature was imposed since our base fluid therminol vp cannot operate as liquid above in this analysis volume fraction copper nanofluids were chosen based on their approximate optimum point in fig note graphite will be modeled and compared against the experimental results in sec vi figure also shows model results for the pure base fluid e nearly nonabsorbing with selective surface black backing under similar receiver operating conditions the results in fig illustrate that nanofluid collector may operate more efficiently than conventional surface solar collector under optimum conditions up to higher for solar concentration ratios in the range of as shown in the figure the nanofluid and its operating conditions must be chosen carefully or the system may end up operating less efficiently nanofluid receiver could also potentially be useful in direct steam generation system like those described in ref but phase change was not modeled in this paper figure also indicates for given nanofluid type and receiver geometry that maximum efficiency is reached at solar concentrations of about or kw incoming solar flux this maximum occurs as slight positive function of the outlet temperature g higher outlet temperature leads to peak efficiency occurring at slightly higher concentration ratio again these results are dependent on the many constant system parameters but the trends should be similar for other designs in order to evaluate some of the predictions of this model some experiments with nanofluid dish collector were conducted previous work of the co authors found that for low temperature solar collectors the numerical model matches quite well with experimental data from mini flat plate solar collector to explore higher temperature collectors dish collector was chosen the dish was selected because it is easy to work with and because we were able to build the whole collector system cheaply tracking mounting system was designed and built in few weeks using graciously donated parabolic dish from the physics laboratory of lake havasu although this laboratory scale dish collector is not directly comparable to the large scale results found above we believe the relative comparison between nanofluid volumetric receiver and its base fluid with semiabsorbing backing is valuable as validation of the model also we use relative comparison to divide out the losses present in our experimental system the system is composed of three parts the tracking system the dish and the receiver the tracking system is controlled in one axis throughout the day by two photodiodes connected by simple control circuit to step motor the motors adjust when shade from fin covers one of the photodiodes which keeps the normal axis of the dish parallel to the sun the second axis of the dish the tilt angle is adjusted manually the dish is made of polished aluminum and has an intercept area of the manufacturer quoted average dish reflectivity is however this reflectivity is for the ideal flat material e normal incidence in pristine condition thus in our experiments we expect slightly lower reflectivity the receiver was machined from two separate blocks of aluminum which are bolted together with glazing at the center the thickness e depth of the fluid flowing in the receiver is mm the experimental receiver design has double paned cm cm microscope slide glazing in the modeling results above the model only included single pane of clean glazing for simplicity each additional glazing can be assumed to be another loss figure shows images of the dish and receiver used in these experiments removed from the receiver are the thermocouples which measure the heat energy gain and pressure probes which determine the flow rate inside the receiver temperatures seen inside the receiver were up to mass flow rates in the collector were on the order of kg giving laminar reynolds numbers of approximately for all steady flow conditions the receiver backing was left as machined aluminum which we assumed had reflectivity around since it was dull finish tests with reflected green laser indicated that this was reasonable estimate furthermore we know the aluminum backing absorbs about half of the incident light because tests with just the base fluid convert sunlight into heat at efficiency in our experiments reflection off the front glazing reflections from the aluminum backing transmitted out of the fluid and heat losses presumably add to give base fluid efficiency of the base fluid used in these experiments is the same as that assumed in the model therminol vp heat transfer oil graphite nanoparticles were mixed into the therminol oil since our analysis showed that they appear to be the cheapest and most efficient solar absorbers the volume fractions used in this mm deep channel are and in these fluids the particles will be closer to each other than the low volume fractions mentioned above but we can still use the rayleigh scattering approximation of the model also in one pass mm through the collector these volume fractions are expected to absorb of the incoming solar spectrum which is very similar to the modeling results above the dish collector has geometric concentration ratio of which is very near the optimum concentration ratio of fig this concentration ratio is calculated using the measured intercept area of the dish and dividing by the measured spot size found using burn paper during testing the dish experienced direct normal irradiances of m tempe az from nrel ref it should also be noted that data of the global irradiance were also recorded periodically during the experiments for this pyranometer from matrix inc st mesa az usa an mk sol meter was used to confirm the data from nrel at its peak the nanofluid dish tracker achieved maximum solar to thermal energy conversion efficiency of at outlet temperatures this is about higher than the receiver with the therminol oil alone under similar conditions figure shows the steady state efficiencies achieved in these experiments since we did not know the exact optical efficiency for the dish collector g spectral reflectivity of the dish and other components as well as shadowing from components efficiencies are plotted as ratio of the nanofluid steady state thermal efficiency to the base fluid steady state efficiency under similar conditions figure shows these results with error bars determined by simple error propagation analysis these experiments indicate that nanofluids can only provide an advantage if the composition is chosen carefully and the fluid tracking system is precisely controlled for higher volume fractions we had difficult time achieving relative efficiencies near what the model predicted one possible reason for poor results is that the nanofluids were unstable e the particles agglomerate become large heavy and settle out at higher volume fractions another possible reason is that in more concentrated nanofluid light will be absorbed in thin upper layer of the fluid where it can easily transfer back out of the receiver while the model should predict thermal emission for an ideal stable nanofluids significant deviations are possible with high solar fluxes if particle agglomeration occurs on the other hand for lower volume fractions our experiments found significant efficiency improvements that matched quite well with the model volume fraction of graphite resulted in approximately an improvement in steady state efficiency over the base fluid overall our limited preliminary data show that similar efficiency improvements are possible in when the fluid is chosen and controlled carefully however if the nanofluid becomes unstable or if tracking is inaccurate nanofluid collector can become very inefficient indeed it is estimated that less than or kg of nanoparticles would be needed in or mwe solar thermal power plant respectively thus at nanoparticle price of kg ref as mentioned above the cost increase of using nanofluid would still be less than of the total plant capital investment assuming the cost of changing receivers was not estimated but no exotic materials or fabrication methods would be needed to produce large scale nanofluid receiver in fact receiver made of antireflective glass steel and insulation may actually be cheaper than ceramic mesh receiver it should be noted that operation and maintenance costs are more difficult to estimate we believe from the observation of stagnant nanofluids stored in glass containers for up to months that very little extra maintenance would be required inside nanofluid receiver in the short term that is properly prepared nanofluid in closed loop could be relatively stable and should not need replacement good design operation and maintenance with occasional cleaning could keep interior surfaces transparent and free from particle deposits closed system should also prevent any added environmental costs during the nanofluid use phase however long term studies have not been conducted and nanofluid leak spill prevention and or clean up could be costly for instance remixing of the nanofluid and cleaning of optical surfaces may be necessary on regular basis which could require specialized equipment expenses beyond the initial capital investment are not estimated in this study for simple economic comparison we will conservatively assume that an optimized nanofluid receiver can be about more efficient than conventional one to demonstrate the advantage of this small change fig gives comparison of yearly electricity generation between conventional power plant with the characteristics of abengoa ps and similar plant with nanofluid receiver that is both receivers have solar concentration ratio receiver area outlet temperature and power block efficiency similar to the ps both systems assume capacity factor of for the solar resource available at the given locations in fig in other words we conservatively assume that maintenance or other factors will take the plant out of service for of the sunny hours thus the only difference between the two systems is that the receiver is operating more efficiently the locations in fig were chosen because they cover wide range of solar resource conditions as such the results range from seattle wa to tucson az which on the average receive kw m of direct normal incident solar energy per day as given by nrel for axis trackers comparison of different locations merely demonstrates that any enhancement from nanofluid receiver would become even more advantageous for areas with higher incoming solar energy figure puts the comparison in monetary terms assuming sale of electricity at cents kw and scales it up to mwe commercial sized plant again conservative power block efficiency of was used but for the larger scale plant we assume that of the solar resource could be utilized even with conservative assumptions this kind of enhancement adds nearly million to the yearly revenue of large plant which could take about two years off the simple payback time of the plant assuming installed if peak prices and carbon credits are taken into account nanofluid receiver would look even more attractive overall the goal of this paper was to conduct conservative simplified analysis of how nanofluid based concentrating solar thermal system would compare to conventional one based on the results of this study nanofluids have excellent potential for power tower solar thermal power plants efficiency improvement on the order of is possible with nanofluid receiver ideally these enhancements could be realized with very little change in terms of materials system design and initial capital investment to the entire solar thermal system fundamental differences in volumetric absorption versus solid surface absorption drive this enhancement in thermal efficiency for power tower solar plant it should be noted however that nanofluids are not expected to be suitable for dish or trough solar thermal systems at this time but further optimization or cost reductions might expand their range of applicability in this study particular nanoparticle material shape and some characteristic operation temperatures were chosen using engineering judgment but further optimization is possible it is expected that additional improvements could be made by tailoring the optical and thermal properties of the nanofluid more closely to specific system conditions this

thermal plant operating in tucson az could add million to the yearly revenue of large scale plants under favorable conditions  piezoelectric tube scanners have emerged as the most widely used nanopositioning technology in modern scanning probe microscopes despite their impressive properties their fast and accurate operations are hindered due to complications such as scan induced mechanical vibrations hysteresis nonlinearity creep and thermal drift this paper presents an overview of emerging innovative solutions inspired from recent advances in fields such as smart structures feedback control and advanced estimation aimed at maximizing positioning precision and bandwidth of piezoelectric tube scanners the paper presents thorough survey of the related literature and contains suggestions for future research prospects nanotechnology is the science of understanding and control of matter at dimensions of nm or less key enabling tool for nanotechnology research is scanning probe microscopy this family of microscopes allows researchers to study and manipulate matter at the molecular and atomic levels central to the operation of scanning probe microscope spm is scanning device that is required to operate with nanometer or subnanometer precision number of technologies have been proposed to realize such mechanism at the time of this writing piezoelectric tube scanners are the most widely used scanning technology in spms positioning accuracy and speed of piezoelectric tube scanner are limited due to certain complications inherent to piezoelectric materials this article describes number of emerging trends aimed at realizing fast and accurate scanning mechanisms for spms the paper is structured as follows section ii presents very brief introduction to scanning probe microscopy emphasizing the need for rastering various rastering technologies including piezoelectric tube scanners are discussed in this section section iii is concerned with electromechanical properties of piezoelectric tube scanners the y positioning capability and the resonant nature of the scanner and its adverse effect on the achievable scanning speed are discussed the effects of hysteresis creep and thermal drift on the positioning accuracy of tube are explained and the possibility of utilizing feedback control as remedy is explored section iv concentrates on electrical properties of piezoelectric tube scanner in particular piezoelectric tube actuator is modeled as two port electric circuit the possibility of using strain induced piezoelectric voltage as measurement signal in feedback loop is investigated in this section it is explained how this signal can be utilized to improve the displacement measurements obtained from capacitive sensor section iv discusses the sensorless control of piezoelectric tube scanner and reveals its inherent feedback structure section discusses possible future directions and concludes the paper scanning probe microscopy refers to family of instruments that enables us to study and also to manipulate matter over the dimensions of several mto pm spms are therefore capable of interrogating and altering the surface profile of sample at the molecular and atomic levels the two most widely used spms are scanning tunneling microscopes stms and atomic force microscopes afms the stm was invented in early by binnig and rohrer at the ibm zurich research laboratory in switzerland it uses the principle of electron tunneling between sharp probe tip and conducting surface to develop three dimensional image of the surface with atomic resolution the probe is brought to within nanometer distance of the surface and potential difference is introduced between the two objects once tunneling current is established the probe is moved in raster pattern in the y plane the distance between the probe and the surface is adjusted during rastering to regulate the current plotting the vertical movements of the probe against its y coordinates results in topographical image of the surface with very high resolution like the stm the afm relies on scanning approach to produce images of material surfaces with extremely high resolutions the afm measures ultrasmall forces in the order of nn or less between the afm tip and sample surface the force is determined by measuring the motion of very flexible microcantilever with an extremely small mass key advantage of the afm is its ability to investigate surfaces of nonconducting as well as conducting materials thus overcoming major restriction of stm good reviews of scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy can be found in refs an important component of spm is its scanning head that moves either the sample or the probe in raster pattern in the y plane it also controls the distance between the probe and the sample through the axis servo number of technologies have been proposed to make this functionality feasible the first stms used piezoelectric tripod scanners for rastering in this arrangement three piezoelectric stack actuators are used to form tripod probe is attached to the tip of the tripod where its three legs meet the y rastering and the axis movements are achieved by applying appropriate signals to the three stack actuators to achieve an acceptable scanning range tripod scanner would have to be built to be relatively large this arrangement can be rather bulky and is thus rarely used in modern spms the use of piezoelectric tube actuator with quartered electrodes for positioning in spm was first reported in ref today the majority of commercially available spms use piezoelectric tube scanner for y positioning they have simple construction are easy to integrate into microscope and are relatively inexpensive flexure based and nanopositioning platforms have recently been incorporated into small number of commercially available afms these positioning stages typically have parallel kinematic design and use piezoelectric stacks for actuation and flexure guidance system to eliminate friction and stiction small motions generated by piezoelectric stack actuators are amplified using mechanical leveraging system capacitive sensors are integrated within these nanopositioning platforms making it possible to use advanced control design methodologies to increase their precision and bandwidth these scanners are particularly attractive due to the low presence of cross coupling between their various axes in terms of scanning speeds flexure based scanners are comparable with piezoelectric tube scanners for relatively similar scanning range an experimental scanning system proposed recently in refs and has been shown to have the potential to achieve very fast scanning speeds however due to its direct drive nature its scanning range is rather limited compared with piezoelectric tube scanners flexure based positioning platforms are much more complicated mechanisms and hence at the time of this writing substantially more expensive consequently piezoelectric tube scanners are likely to remain the most widely used positioning platform in spms and in other applications where mirco and nanoscale positioning is necessity with regard to the latter we may refer to applications such as piezoelectric tube based gyroscopes inertial drives and cell manipulation instrumentation electromechanical properties of piezoelectric tube as illustrated in fig piezoelectric tube scanner comprises tube of radially poled piezoelectric material four external electrodes and an internal electrode one end of the tube is fixed and the other end is free to move opposite external electrodes are segmented in four equal sectors of opposite electrodes are driven by signals of identical magnitudes but opposite signs as illustrated in fig once voltage is applied to these electrodes one side of the tube extends vertically while the opposite side contracts resulting in bending this in turn results in two dimensional movement of the free end of the tube in the y plane for y actuation the inner electrode is grounded to actuate the tube in the direction however the inner electrode is driven by the signal an appropriate application of the three signals allows for full y positioning of the free end of the tube another configuration includes circumferential outer electrode for independent vertical extension or contraction drawback of this configuration is that the y scan range may be reduced as the electrodes on the outer surface of the tube are used for actuation in all three directions an advantage is that the inner electrode is grounded at all times simplifying the task of designing electronic amplifiers that are used to drive the actuator yet another possibility is to have quartered internal electrodes for the remainder of this review we assume that the tube electrodes are as shown in fig precise calculation of the scanning range of piezoelectric tube could be rather difficult the bending of the tube is function of the electric field and the nonuniform induced strain however assuming that opposite voltages are applied to the opposite electrodes as in fig and assuming small deflections would result in the following approximate expression for the tip translation along the or direction d dhvi x here is the deflection in the or direction is the piezoelectric strain constant is the tube length is the outside diameter of the tube is the tube thickness and vi represents the or axis electrode voltage alternatively one may choose to apply the actuation voltage only to one of the two electrodes as illustrated in fig this would halve the tip deflection expressed in eq incidentally this is the arrangement used in the original design of binnig and smith reported in ref when operated in this mode the opposite electrode is often grounded however instead of grounding this electrode it is possible to use the voltage induced in it due to the piezoelectric effect for other purposes this property of piezoelectric tube scanners has been overlooked by researchers and will be discussed in detail later in sec iv vertical translation of the tube due to voltage vz applied to its inner electrode is approximately given by d lhvz static deflections of tube expressed in eqs and remain valid at low frequencies to understand the dynamics of tube at higher frequencies requires detailed finite element analysis it turns out that piezoelectric tube scanner is highly resonant system consequently the transfer function of tube possesses numerous lightly damped poles e poles that are very close to the axis the frequency response of tube is illustrated in fig this particular piezoelectric tube is made from pzt piezoelectric ceramic material its height is mm its thickness is mm and its outer diameter is mm figure plots the lateral displacement of the tube measured by capacitive sensor as result of signal applied to the opposite electrode signal that contains frequency components at or close to the tube first resonance frequency will result in significant displacements this leads to major complication in high speed operations of spms to force the free end of the tube to move in raster pattern triangular signal is applied to the axis fast axis electrodes and slowly increasing ramp signal is applied to the axis slow axis electrodes this is depicted in fig where pseudoramp signal is applied to the slow axis triangular waveform contains all odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency although the amplitudes of these harmonic signals diminish as with being the harmonic number if fast triangular waveform is applied to the tube it will inevitably excite the resonance this situation is depicted in fig the st harmonic of the hz signal is relatively close to the first resonance frequency of the tube e hz although its corresponding amplitude is more than times smaller than the hz component of the triangular signal and despite the fact that it is hz away from the resonance this harmonic generates significant distortions thus instead of following perfect triangle the free end of the tube traces distorted triangular waveform along the fast axis consequently the resulting raster pattern will be distorted to avoid this complication the scanning speed of spms is often limited to about of the tube first resonance frequency for the tube whose frequency response is illustrated in fig this amounts to speed limitation of about hz hysteresis creep piezoelectric materials exhibit hysteretic behavior thus piezoelectric actuator driven by voltage amplifier is nonlinear device and should be treated as such due to the presence of hysteresis when triangular voltage signal is applied to piezoelectric actuator the resulting displacement can deviate from linear by as much as between the forward and backward movements the commercially available spm software usually compensates for the hysteresis effect by scanning always in the same direction in this open loop approach the input triangular signal is perturbed to achieve an acceptable trajectory thus minimizing the effect of this particular form of nonlinearity another possibility is to model piezoelectric actuator as linear dynamic system cascaded with static nonlinearity that represents the hysteretic nature of the device number of techniques have been proposed to model hysteresis in this framework including the classical preisach hysteresis model and the maxwell resistive capacitor model feedback based techniques such as adaptive control and robust control design techniques have also been used to deal with hysteresis in nanoscale positioning platforms another method that does not require an accurate model is the phaser approach reported in refs and describing functions have also been implemented with some success an interesting and unique property of piezoelectric materials is that when driven by charge source they display minimal hysteresis figure illustrates the improvement that can be achieved when piezoelectric tube scanner is controlled by charge source this property has been known since however until very recently it has been rarely used due to the difficulties associated with driving highly capacitive loads with commercially available charge or current amplifiers the key problem is that the output signal produced by such amplifiers when applied to piezoelectric actuator tends to drift with time due to the highly capacitive nature of the load this issue has been observed by number of researchers recent research proposes new structure for charge and current sources capable of regulating the dc profile of the actuator dc accurate charge current amplifier has also been reported in refs and other recent studies in this area include ref and creep is another undesirable property common in piezoelectric materials when the applied voltage to piezoelectric actuator undergoes sudden change the piezoelectric material will creep and this can result in significant loss in precision when positioning is required over extended periods of time in particular during slow operation of spms creep can result in significant distortions in the generated image in particular creep has two adverse effects in spms the vertical position of the tip will creep after it approaches the sample and ii it exacerbates the effect of hysteresis at the turning point of the scanning trajectory number of methods have been proposed to deal with this phenomenon one approach is based on approximating the creep effect as nonlinearity that can then be inverted while another method presented in ref develops linear model to describe the low frequency nature of creep in fast scanning probe microscopy creep is of little consequence however due to the fact that most spms are operated quite slowly its effect cannot be overlooked although scanning probe microscopy was originally invented as an imaging tool it is being increasingly used as nanoscale manipulation device one of the most vexatious features of spms particularly in applications that involve nanomanipulation is the thermal drift of their mechanical setup this arises from the thermal expansion and contraction of their mechanical components in typical afm operated in ambient temperature change in temperature can cause nm drift although this effect can be suppressed in low temperature experiments mainly in uhv spms in applications that involve interrogation and manipulation of the matter in ambient temperature it amounts to substantial hurdle number of techniques have been proposed to compensate for this effect g refs recent research shows that kalman filter can be used to estimate the drift quite effectively and subsequently compensate for it there has been consistent effort in recent years to improve accuracy and speed of spms using feedback control techniques one of the earliest attempts to control piezoelectric tube scanner is reported in ref where noncontacting inductive sensor was used to measure the lateral displacement of tube lag lead and controllers were designed and implemented on the tube and the feasibility of reducing the adverse effects of creep and hysteresis was demonstrated the authors also reported that their controller achieved damping of high frequency vibrations reference describes the use of loop shaping procedure to design feedback controller for piezoelectric tube actuator instrumented with optical displacement sensors to track raster pattern their results show reductions in tracking error and cross coupling due to the use of feedback control examples of other works showing successful applications of feedback include refs the key idea associated with feedback based methods is to damp the first resonant mode of the piezoelectric tube actuator this flattening of the frequency response of the scanner will allow tracking of faster triangular waveform and consequently faster scan furthermore in order to achieve accurate positioning at high frequencies and to minimize the adverse effect of hysteresis the feedback gain is often chosen to be high there is limit on how high the feedback gain can be made before the closed loop system is made unstable since the existence of sharp resonant peaks in the frequency response of the actuator typically results in very low gain margin using notch filters in the feedback loop has been shown to result in an improvement in the achievable gain margin the use of high gain feedback for accurate tracking is necessitated due to the hysteretic nature of the piezoelectric actuator if the actuator is driven by charge source the hysteresis is significantly reduced resulting in an almost linear system thus using charge one should expect to obtain feedback control system that has better robustness properties an inversion based feedforward method has also been applied to piezoelectric tube actuators feature of feedforward control scheme is that it does not require any additional sensors for implementation in ref model based inversion approach was used to compensate for positioning distortions caused by creep hysteresis and induced vibrations low order feedforward controller was presented in ref to suppress the lateral oscillation of piezoelectric tube scanner the feedforward controller was designed using the method such that the system is not excited at frequencies around the first resonance of the piezoelectric tube scanner the performance of feedforward control schemes heavily relies on an accurate model of the system combining feedback and feedforward compensations has been shown to result in satisfactory tracking in piezoelectric tube nanopositioner in the presence of parameter uncertainties in the plant model the key problem associated with using feedback control in piezoelectric tube scanners is the need for sensor to measure displacement displacement sensors are often expensive and their integration into the scanning stage of spms could be difficult task the main drawback of using displacement sensors however is noise capacitive sensors have emerged as the most widely used displacement sensors in spms the capacitive sensor used to generate the frequency response in fig can measure up to and has root mean square rms noise of about pm hz over bandwidth of khz this amounts to rms noise of nm clearly inadequate for atomic level manipulations and interrogations limiting the bandwidth to hz would reduce the sensor noise to level that is sufficient for scanning tunneling microscopy g for atomic resolution on graphite however this would significantly limit the scanning speed of the device consequently feedback has not been used in stms if the presence of sensor noise can be tolerated the use of feedback control in spms becomes very attractive option apart from the extremely important possibility of achieving much higher scanning frequencies feedback allows one to address other issues that hamper fast operation of spms for example it is common practice to ignore the cross coupling that naturally exists between various axes of piezoelectric tube scanner however experimental results confirm that this cross coupling could be substantial cross coupling of db at low frequencies is quite normal and this effect could be even more severe at the resonance frequency of the tube that is slow triangular motion of one axis can translate into m triangular motion of the other axis generating substantial distortion in the resulting image this effect becomes more significant if the actuator is used in high speed scanning regime while cross coupling is an inherent property of piezoelectric tube actuators the eccentricity of the tube is known to exacerbate its effect feedback can be used to address problems of this nature this awareness has contributed to significant studies aimed at developing good understanding of the dynamics of piezoelectric tube actuators see refs and references therein electrical model of piezoelectric from an electrical point of view each electrode of piezoelectric tube can be modeled as capacitor in series with dependent voltage source the existence of this voltage is an immediate consequence of the piezoelectric effect and is directly related to the mechanical strain experienced by each quarter of the tube figure illustrates the electrical equivalent of the symmetrically driven actuator illustrated in fig the key assumption here is that the tube is perfectly symmetrical and uniform notice that the piezoelectric voltages induced in the opposite electrodes are out of phase this reflects the fact that while one side of the tube is extended the other side is equally contracted furthermore this implies that the polarization vector points radially outward the electrical equivalent of the asymmetrically driven tube in fig is depicted in fig the assumption made here is that both sides of the tube undergo equal but opposite strains and consequently the piezoelectric voltages induced in the opposite electrodes are equal but out of phase although in practice there is small difference between these two voltages due to the asymmetric nature of actuation for most applications this approximation is quite acceptable also notice that for identical applied voltages the vp corresponding to the asymmetrical case is half of that when the tube is driven symmetrically the situation depicted in fig presents us with possibility that until very recently and rather surprisingly appears to have escaped the attention of most researchers the free electrode can be used as sensor the frequency response of the tube when one of the electrodes is driven by signal and the voltage induced in the opposite electrode is taken as the output is plotted in fig comparing this with the displacement frequency response of the same scanner in fig one can make number of interesting and important observations both systems have identical resonance frequencies e the two transfer functions have identical poles the third resonance in fig appears to have an insignificant magnitude however the phase transition clearly illustrates its existence incidentally the third mode is the piston mode of the scanner which is expected to have very low profile on its lateral displacement frequency response in most nanoscale positioning applications the tube is operated at frequencies well below its first resonance frequency over these range of frequencies the piezoelectric voltage induced in the free electrode vp can be used as measure of lateral deflection of the tube this is illustrated in fig which compares the two frequency responses from hzto khz it can be observed that between hz and the first resonance frequency of the tube the two frequency response functions are almost identical at frequencies below hz however the frequency response function frf corresponding to vp is clearly distorted this is due to the fact that vp is measured by device that has finite input impedance assuming that the measurement instrument has an input resistance of rin the measured voltage vs isvs ss where rincp thus the signal measured at the open terminal of the tube will be distorted at low frequencies and will not be able to determine the static deflection of the tube the low frequency nature of the measured signal can be substantially improved if buffer circuit with very high input impedance is introduced between the free electrode and the measurement instrument although the input impedance of the buffer can be made extremely large it will always be finite number thus the problem at dc remains the problem is further compounded due to the existence of dielectric leakage current in the sensing electrode although the parallel resistor introduced corresponding to this effect is often quite large use of piezoelectric despite its poor low frequency nature the piezoelectric voltage can be used for number of purposes an immediate possibility is to use it in feedback loop to augment the tube damping this idea was recently implemented in refs and with noticeable success in this approach the piezoelectric voltage is used as measurement and controller is designed to add substantial damping to the first resonant mode of the tube this flattens the tube frequency response and the better damped scanner is then driven by triangular signal for rastering due to its flatter frequency response the scanner can be used at much higher speeds e faster triangular waveforms can be utilized thus in this approach the main purpose of the controller is to better damp the tube once this is achieved the better damped scanner is essentially driven in an open loop to use the piezoelectric voltage as measurement signal is quite sensible option particularly considering its compelling noise properties the rms displacement noise of the scanner described in sec iii was measured to be in the order of fm hz when compared with the rms noise corresponding to the capacitive sensor measurement described in sec iii i pm hz this shows three order of magnitude improvement assuming that both sensors are operated over the same bandwidth however since the piezoelectric displacement sensor cannot be used for dc and low frequency measurements the controller cannot be used to address issues such as creep and thermal drift nor can it be used for accurate dc positioning the above discussion raises an intriguing possibility capacitive sensor can be used for dc and low frequency displacement measurements while the piezoelectric signal can be employed to measure the same quantity but over the frequencies that lie out of the bandwidth of the capacitive sensor this arrangement would enable one to lower the bandwidth of the capacitive sensor and subsequently to increase its sensitivity the signals produced by the two sensors would have to be processed in manner suitable for feedback control two possibilities have been recently investigated in refs and two sensor based controller was designed directly using the two complementary displacement signals in this approach the two input one output controller uses the capacitive sensor measurement at low frequencies through to the dc and for high frequency tracking and damping of the resonance frequency it uses the piezoelectric voltage signal this situation is sketched in fig the implementation of this technique on the piezoelectric tube scanner whose open loop responses are plotted in fig results in closed loop responses illustrated in fig significant improvement is clearly observable an alternative approach presented in refs and is to first generate an optimal estimate of the displacement using the two complementary signals and then to design single input single output siso controller that utilizes this estimate to achieve the necessary tracking the standard tool for such sensor fusion is the kalman filter this arrangement is depicted in figure having access to the piezoelectric voltage induced in the free electrode of tube enables one to augment the structural damping of the system by shunting the free electrode to an impedance the idea is illustrated in fig where the free electrode is shunted to an rl impedance in this arrangement the inductor and the piezoelectric capacitor cp are tuned to the first resonance frequency of the tube e cp the resistor is then chosen such that damping of the shunted system is maximized the idea of piezoelectric shunt control was initially introduced in ref and later revisited in ref in more depth ever since this technique has been widely used in vibration control applications with piezoelectric actuators see refs and and references therein although piezoelectric actuators are the most widely used means of actuation in nanoscale positioning systems this approach has not been used in this context until very recently to understand the operation of shunted piezoelectric tube actuator consider the situation depicted in fig where the electrode located on one side of the tube is driven by the tracking signal vx and the opposite electrode is shunted to an impedance the three equations that describe the system arevp s vx s vz cps vp vz vz s the first equation is direct consequence of the piezoelectric effect and represents the immediate impact of the impedance on the dynamics of the tube here s is the collocated transfer function of the tube that describes the highly resonant nature of the structure this model can be easily identified the second equation results from the kvl written around the shunted loop and the third equation follows from ohm law equations can be visualized in block diagram form as illustrated in fig an inspection of this block diagram reveals that the presence of the impedance s amounts to feedback controller described byk cpsz cpsz wrapped around the plant s this is an interesting and important observation instead of using one electrode as sensor and the opposite electrode as an actuator we may integrate both functionalities into the very same electrode therefore this method enables us to utilize both electrodes simultaneously for sensing and actuation consequently the scanning range of the scanner can be doubled this is illustrated in fig where the requisite impedance is implemented on one of the electrodes and the voltage at that electrode is measured inverted and then applied to the opposite electrode furthermore if the impedance is chosen to be as shown in fig e s ls the controller turns out to bek s rl rls lcp this is the most simple form of resonant controller described in refs the controller is perfectly suited to add damping to the structure and it has important robustness properties described in the above references the implementation of an rl impedance however may not be as straightforward as one would wish the main complication is due to the highly capacitive nature of the tube and its relatively low first resonance frequency the piezoelectric capacitance of the tube cp is about nf given that the tube first resonance frequency is approximately at hz the requisite inductance is found to be about clearly difficult to realize in practice the synthetic impedance described in ref is practical way of implementing impedances of this nature an important advantage of this approach is that any impedance can be implemented digitally the resistive inductive shunt proposed in ref is known to result in good damping when applied to piezoelectric transducer including piezoelectric tube scanner however due to its passive nature the maximum damping that such an impedance can generate is limited to achieve higher level of damping an active impedance can be designed and implemented digitally as synthetic impedance having identified the feedback structure associated with shunted piezoelectric tube scanner fig enables one to treat the impedance as feedback controller and the remainder of the system as an augmented plant variety of control design techniques can then be used to achieve the damping needed to increase the scanning speed of the apparatus this procedure was applied recently to piezoelectric tube scanner in ref where and optimal impedances were implemented on prototype nanopositioner with very good success very attractive feature of the procedure described above is how easily it can be incorporated into the currently available spms majority of spms use piezoelectric tube scanners for rastering all of these tubes have quartered external electrodes that can be used for simultaneous actuation and sensing instrumenting tube with an appropriate impedance can be achieved by making simple modifications to the electronic driving module digital implementation of the impedance can be realized using the computer that is often an integral part of any spm furthermore this approach does not require any changes to the mechanical components of the spm g there is no need to introduce displacement sensors into the scanning head of the spm before concluding this section we reiterate that the best way to actuate piezoelectric tube scanners is to do it with charge source however since driving piezoelectric actuators with voltage amplifiers is more common in our presentation we have opted to assume that the piezoelectric scanner is actuated with voltage amplifier further details on charge driven piezoelectric tube actuators can be found in ref piezoelectric tube scanners are an integral part of modern spms to achieve fast and accurate operation of spm one is required to address the issues that hinder the positioning accuracy and bandwidth of its scanner this paper presented survey of number of recently emerged technologies and methodologies aimed at maximizing the scanning range precision and scanning speed of piezoelectric tube scanners to this end it should be clear that over the past two decades significant volume of research has appeared on piezoelectric tube scanners this may falsely lead one to conclude that what could have been done has already been done however as the preceding discussion made clear significant improvements can be achieved by utilizing advanced feedback control and estimation techniques and innovative ideas and methods that have emerged in other fields g smart structures by combining these techniques significant improvement in the operating conditions of scanner can be achieved this will in turn translate into faster and more accurate spms real time implementation of these methods often requires access to the fast digital signal processing hardware and the requisite software for small tubes with the first resonance frequency in the tens or hundreds of kilohertz such implementations remain quite challenging analog control implementation could be an answer although one would need to address significant number of issues that naturally arise in such implementations field programmable gate array and its derivative technologies can also be used for this purpose an important matter that has escaped the attention of researchers in this field is the possibility of designing alternative electrode patterns for piezoelectric tube scanners lateral positioning is typically achieved by tube with quartered external electrodes there is no reason why one should limit oneself to the traditional electrode pattern to achieve lateral actuation it should be possible to pattern the external electrodes to achieve satisfactory lateral movements and simultaneous sensing also it may be possible to shape the electrodes such that only the required modes of the tube are excited if one uses the orthogonal properties that govern the mode shapes of tube to conclude piezoelectric tube scanners are currently the most widely utilized nanopositioning tool they are easily manufactured widely available and inexpensive their widespread use is likely to continue well into the future despite their simple construction these scanners are capable of providing astonishing positioning accuracy over notable bandwidths both the positioning accuracy and the bandwidth of piezoelectric tube scanners can be substantially improved by employing model based control and estimation techniques together with deeper understanding of properties of piezoelectric materials of which these devices are made this approach to nanopositioning is likely to result in interesting applications that may be difficult to envision at the time of this writing nonetheless we are set to witness interesting progress in this field in the near future  we present detailed analysis of the optical properties of one dimensional arrays of slits in metal films although enhanced transmission windows are dominated by fabry perot cavity modes localized inside the slits the periodicity introduces surface modes that can either enhance or inhibit light transmission we thus illustrate the interaction between cavity modes and surface modes in both finite and infinite arrays of slits in particular we study grating that clearly separates surface plasmon effects from wood rayleigh anomalies the periodicity of the grating induces strong plasmonic band gap that inhibits coupling to the cavity modes for frequencies near the center of the band gap thereby reducing the transmission of the grating strong field localization at the high energy plasmonic band edge enhances coupling to the cavity modes while field localization at the low energy band edge leads to weak cavity coupling and reduced transmission since the first observation in the early of unexpected narrow bright and dark bands in the reflection spectrum of optical gratings many efforts have been devoted to clarify these anomalous linear optical phenomena that could not be explained by means of ordinary diffraction grating theory the first theoretical interpretation of these effects was provided by lord rayleigh later refined by fano lord rayleigh predicted the spectral positions of the anomalies resulting from the appearance of new spectral orders complete interpretation of wood anomalies was reported many years later by hessel and oliner who identified two anomalous manifestations of the grating the abrupt intensity modulation of diffraction orders at the appearance fading of new spectral orders and ii resonant like anomalies these two effects can occur either separately or simultaneously the resonant effect matches the excitation of leaky waves supported by the grating for specific spectral orders the role of surface plasmons in the formation of these anomalies was first discussed after when otto and kretschmann and raether reported the excitation of surface plasmons on continuous metal films in ebbessen et al demonstrated the extraordinary optical transmission eot of light through metal layer perforated with cylindrical sub wavelength holes the role of surface plasmon polaritons was central in the explanation of the eot effect several authors have reported extraordinary transmission from one dimensional sub wavelength slits instead of holes from the microwave to the uv range however narrow slits do not behave like cylindrical apertures the former is dominated by the transverse electric magnetic tem waveguide mode propagating inside the slits the latter does not support tem modes d metal grating composed of rectangular slits supports wide band fabry perot like resonances whose dispersion can be significantly altered by the presence of the grating the main effect of the periodicity is the activation of surface modes without the grating only an evanescent wave coupling mechanism e typical prism coupling can excite surface modes the additional wave vector introduced by the grating along the parallel direction kg where is pitch size induces surface modes on the grating located at frequencies above the light line it is well known that excitation of surface modes in the presence of holes slits can either enhance or inhibit light transmission the dispersion of surface plasmon is omega frac omega sqrt frac varepsilon varepsilon varepsilon varepsilon c where and are the permittivities of the adjacent materials for an air metal interface and complex in the terahertz and microwave regimes omega to frac omega k while at ir and shorter wavelengths the curve is well detached from the light line in air c as it bends toward the surface plasmon resonance omega sp sqrt frac omega varepsilon sp p is the plasma frequency of the metal when the metal surface is patterned with periodic arrangement of grooves or slits the surface plasmon polariton is itself resonant part of the diffracted energy as such it may also be interpreted as particular case of this mode and should be studied in relation to all the phenomena involved in the diffraction process moreover the characteristic wavelength of this mode and its effective refractive index dispersion may be altered by the geometric parameters of the grating e aperture size film thickness grating pitch the dispersion of surface waves may be engineered by properly structuring the surface even in the presence of perfect metallic screens for example for wavelengths close to array periodicity the transmission maxima of one dimensional periodic arrays of slits follow the dispersion relation of bound surface waves these modes become leaky when and their dispersion which is much different from the dispersion of the unperturbed surface plasmon is governed by the geometrical parameters of the grating and the finite conductivity of the metal in what follows we will show that the main effect of the grating is the creation of band gap for surface plasmons along the grating surface which induces transmission suppression through the grating for photon inside the plasmonic band gap ii enhancement and suppression of transmission through the grating at the high and low energy band edges of the above mentioned plasmonic band gap we will also present detailed study of the linear optical response of metal gratings for tm polarization focusing on symmetric rectangular slits carved on silver layers as function of the geometric parameters in section ii we show the dynamical interaction of cavity and surface resonances in going from the single slit case to the infinite array scenario and in the case of an infinite array by varying the pitch size in section iii we discuss the origin of the plasmonic band gap and enhanced transmission at the high energy edge of this forbidden gap finally in section iv we study the transmission properties of the grating as function of incident angle aperture size of the slits and grating thickness these parameters are varied to emphasize how the plasmonic band gap follows the dispersion of the unperturbed surface plasmon ii the air filling ratio influences the spectral position of the band gap iii the plasmonic band gap is modified when guided modes are cut off we begin by analyzing the problem of single rectangular slit carved on silver substrate see fig all calculations and results reported in this paper were obtained using at least three different computational methods that yield nearly identical results commercial code based on the finite element method comsol multiphysics d fdtd and time domain fft bpm whose details have been discussed elsewhere some slight differences are observable only in proximity of the wood anomaly where the use of long temporal windows is required to capture the very narrow spectral features around these regions the dispersion profile of silver was fitted using two oscillator lorentz drude model to capture free and bound electron contributions to the linear dielectric constant in the visible and near ir ranges the influence of the geometric parameters and their respective dependence on the impinging wavelength was considered in an attempt to extract information about the nature of the interaction between the geometrical features and the transmission response as shown in figs d single slit exhibits marked resonant behavior similar to that of fabry perot resonances surface modes are poorly coupled to the incident light but the fabry perot waveguide modes couple strongly with the incident light at the resonant wavelengths frac lambda eff neff where is an integer and neff is the effective index of the metal air metal waveguide the resonance transmission peaks are governed by the thickness of the metal layer and slit size fig is obtained by considering plane wave tuned at nm impinging at normal incidence on single slit with variable size and film thickness and vary in the ranges nm nm and nm nm respectively transmittance is normalized to the portion of energy illuminating the slit as already pointed out elsewhere these kinds of resonances are characterized by significant field localization inside the isolated slit and they induce enhanced transmission without any contributions from surface corrugations or any grating effects in single slit in fact the transmission process is mostly driven by the tm fundamental mode whose dispersion is strongly influenced by metal conductivity and slit size if one considers waveguide made by two parallel plates separated by free space gap the effective index of the fundamental tm mode is exactly equal to one only in the case of perfect electric conductor pec in that case the field profile inside the gap region is constant and zero in the metal the introduction of finite conductivity allows the mode to penetrate inside the metal thus increasing the effective index the dispersion of this modified mode then follows metal dispersion moreover even at microwave wavelengths where the conductivity is very high if the sub wavelength gap is small enough it will show an effective index slightly higher than unity at optical frequencies light inside the waveguide can penetrate strongly into the metal walls leading to effective indices of order or more thus providing strong index contrast at the end faces of the open cavity another effect that should be considered when the waveguide is abruptly truncated is the strength of the coupling between the guided mode and free space even when the surrounding metal is assumed to be pec the effect of truncation produces spectral shift of the fabry perot resonances which should be added to the above mentioned shift induced by the finite conductivity of metal the existence of the main propagating mode supported by the parallel plate waveguide leads to significant enhancement of the transmission that approaches with respect to the energy that impinges on the geometrical area of the isolated slit resonant behavior is also evident in figs and the figures were obtained by varying only one of the parameters in fig and in fig and the incident wavelength tuned in the visible range the other geometrical parameter was arbitrarily fixed to nm fig and nm fig a multiple slit geometry structured in one dimensional periodic array introduces the pitch as an additional degree of freedom it is well known that adding more slits does not enhance significantly the transmission value itself which indeed tends to saturate for more than slits however this argument does not hold under certain circumstances if pitch size is close to one of the fabry perot like resonances the spectral response can be significantly altered as demonstrated in reference for pec grating and for metals at microwave or thz frequencies in what follows we will explore the scenario in which the perforated metal operates at optical frequencies and the dispersion of the smooth air metal surface plasmon omega frac omega sqrt frac varepsilon varepsilon varepsilon varepsilon c is well detached from the light line as an example in fig we show the transmission spectrum at normal incidence for single slit blue line circle markers compared to the transmission spectra of multiple slit arrays having increasing number of slits and to an infinitely long array dark blue line cross markers aperture size is fixed at nm film thickness is nm and pitch size is nm for the grating having finite number of slits the transmission is calculated using beam having wide top hat shape for the infinite array we simulated an input plane wave and periodic boundary conditions this kind of arrays is usually fabricated by depositing metal films on substrates such as si pyrex or glass using thermionic beam evaporation or sputter systems thicknesses can be easily controlled in both systems once the metal film has been properly deposited the slits are customarily milled by means of focused ion beam system for example in ref one dimensional patterns of extremely sub wavelength slits as small as nm with pitch of nm have been fabricated on nm thick gold film using ga ion beam controlled by raith elphy quantum software hardware system with an accelerating voltage of kev and an ion current of pa however it is worth stressing that the presence of substrate does not significantly alter the physics of the structure inducing only spectral shift of fabry perot and plasmonic resonances for this reason we study the effect of multiple slits considering the simple case in which the structure is free standing grating surrounded by air by choosing pitch size equal to the fabry perot like resonance wavelength we are introducing interference between the wood anomaly onset of the first order diffracted wave propagating along the grating surface and the fabry perot cavity resonance of the system in going from one to two slits the resonance narrows and the maximum transmission increases with just few more slits the wood anomaly effect becomes evident so that the fabry perot resonance undergoes strong reshaping driven by the periodicity of the array the interference between propagating and evanescent orders diffracted by the grating induces split of the original resonance with the introduction of transmission minimum the effect becomes even more pronounced in the limit of an infinite number of slits dark blue line cross markers for which the dip becomes wide gap and sharp transmission edge appears at slightly blue shifted wavelength as also happens with structures that are periodic on the scale of the wavelength of the impinging light the addition of more periods in the structure favors the opening and widening of band gap whose center and width are controlled mainly by the number of periods in the structure careful look at the position of the transmission minimum fig highlights the difference between the perfect conductor case where the minimum occurs at the wood rayleigh wavelength indicated in fig by the wr arrow and the finite conductivity metal case where the transmission shows deep minimum where the air metal surface plasmon wavelength matches grating pitch indicated in fig with the sp arrow while in this case the shift between the wr and sp points is nm it increases at higher frequencies where the surface plasmon effective index is larger as we will show in the next example the presence of band gaps in the surface plasmon dispersion curve was observed by ritchie et al on al and au shallow gratings moreover the similarity of surface plasmon traveling on corrugated surface and photonic band gap structure as well as the relationship between the band gap and the periodicity have already been discussed for shallow and deep grooves on metal films nevertheless this structure has an additional feature with respect to those described in refs the slits traverse the entire thickness of the metal layer so that the resulting fabry perot resonances excited inside the slits are potentially able to couple surface waves from the input to the output section of the grating when dealing with an infinite array of slits there are three other mechanisms absent in the single slit case the interaction between diffracted waves the introduction of surface waves triggered by the reciprocal lattice vector of the grating the strong perturbation induced by the grating itself on surface waves from now on we will focus only on infinite arrays these structures fully preserve the fabry perot resonance positions the characteristics of their single slit counterpart and remain dominant features however by varying pitch size one can either isolate these fabry perot modes or cause them to interact with the diffraction process taking place on the grating in fig we plot the transmission of single rectangular slit with an aperture size nm and length nm that pierces the silver layer from side to side in this spectrum two resonances can be easily recognized around nm and nm if one considers an array of these slits with pitch size nm the resulting structure is in the zero order grating condition documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation frac lambda frac in sin theta max left in out right end equation end document ninsin maxnin nout where is the incident angle and nin and nout are the input and output refractive indexes respectively as result the grating is sub wavelength and the only forward propagating diffracted wave is the zero th order all higher orders are evanescent as displayed in fig there are no significant modifications in the shape of the spectrum which matches quite well the resonances of an isolated cavity of the same size the reason for this derives from the simple observation of the position of the wood anomaly wavelengths lambda x frac sin theta lambda inc frac p c sin inc mp where is the angle of incidence and inc is the incident wavelength we emphasize that the fabry perot cavity modes of the single slit named and in fig guarantee total transmission of and fig respectively even with metal film nm thick which in this operating regime is virtually opaque without apertures on the other hand by tuning the period of the grating inside the resonance bandwidth one is able to alter at will the transmittance function and to reshape one or more fabry perot resonances simultaneously as figs and show periodicity nm or nm splits the horizontal resonances and creates one band gap fig and two band gaps fig respectively the effect of this interaction manifests itself with the near complete inhibition of transmission this condition takes place for those surface plasmon wavelengths that match exactly the grating pitch so that at normal incidence sp m the impinging light then exploits the sub wavelength features of the grating to find the missing momentum that allows the potential propagation of surface plasmon without resorting to any other evanescent coupling mechanisms the use of the term potential is not fortuitous since at the transmission minimum wavelength the grating is simultaneously coupling the incident plane wave onto the surface plasmon mode while de coupling it in the backward direction this mechanism may be also explained using another point of view after the grating delivers the incoming energy to the surface plasmon wave first order diffraction mode this guided mode encounters an effective plasmonic band gap along the air metal interface induced by the alternation of air sections the thin slits and metallic sections that prevents any surface mode from propagation over certain bandwidth the spectrum of fig is magnified and shown in fig around the wavelength nsppp with spp rm re sqrt frac varepsilon ag varepsilon ag nspp re ag ag one may recognize sharp resonance at nm denoted by resonance in the figure gap located in the neighborhood of the unperturbed plasmonic wavelength and two wider maxima on each side of these anomalous spectral features the state and the gap introduced by the periodicity which are reminiscent of the fabry perot resonance we name the hybridization of the fabry perot resonance excited by the single slit with the surface resonant phenomenon triggered by the diffraction grating while the coupling between cavity and surface modes has been indicated as the mechanism responsible for eot we stress the role of this hybridization also in the formation of the plasmonic band gap the last point marked in fig is the minimum which is strictly related to the formation of forbidden plasmonic band gap the location of m nm is explained in fig where we provide graphical solution of the equation nsppp for the grating under consideration more detailed discussion on the field localization across the band gap region will be given in the next section properties of the plasmonic band gap the most common photonic band gap structure is perhaps dielectric mirror composed of multilayer dielectrics with quarter wave layers the spectral width of the gap depends on the index contrast between the two dielectrics while the depth of the gap depends on the number of periods at the band edges transmission is unity group velocity reaches minimum and there is strong field localization at the high energy band edge the electric field localizes in the low index layers and at the low energy band edge the electric field localizes in the high index layers field localization effects at the photonic band edges have been observed in the spontaneous emission spectra of gaas algaas multilayer light emitting diodes emission from the gaas layers is enhanced and suppressed at the low and high energy band edges respectively if one of the dielectrics composing the multilayer structure is lossy the low group velocity and field localization cause an asymmetry in the transmission and absorption at the band edges but the reflection is only weakly affected by the loss we calculated transmission reflection and absorption for periods multilayer stack obtained alternating nm thick layers having refractive index equal to air with nm thick layers with an index nspp equal to the real part of the effective refractive index of the surface plasmon propagating on smooth air silver interface fig this structure has periodicity nm equal to the pitch of the grating described in fig and it shows the formation of band gap centered at nm solid blue and red lines in fig by introducing losses in the nm thick layers whose refractive index is now we observe an asymmetric response in the transmission and absorption spectra dotted blue and black lines in fig respectively similar to the one described above for the quarter wave stack with losses the inclusion of losses in the air layers mimics the coupling of energy into the guided modes of the slits these modes can be excited either by energy coming from the surface e surface plasmons or by energy coming from the free space see fig reflection is almost identical for the multilayer stack with and without losses fig solid and dotted red lines worthy of note is the fact that due to field localization at the band edges absorption losses at the high energy band edge are much larger than at the low energy band edge black dotted line let us now move back to the metal grating described above nm nm and nm transmission spectrum plotted in fig we studied the transmission properties of the structure by launching surface wave in the transverse direction see fig fig shows the transmission spectrum of the structure in fig one can easily see that the basic features of the plasmonic band structure experienced for the metal grating studied in the configuration of fig appear in the same wavelength range in particular zero transmission state centered at nm is clear indication of the formation of plasmonic band gap surface plasmon wavelength is equal to the period of the grating other analogies between the metal grating and d periodic structure across the band gap region may also be found by analyzing field localization the magnetic field distribution depicted in fig and corresponds to typical first and second order fp resonances respectively fig refers to the point of fig where the only diffracted wave is the zero order and the grating is far from the conditions necessary to excite any significant surface activity the lack of surface waves is confirmed by the absence of strong magnetic fields at the input and output interfaces and by the absence of any significant perturbation of the poynting vector yellow arrows in figs even in the near field of the aperture in fig which corresponds to of fig there is some evidence of surface activity due to the proximity of the plasmonic band gap but the fp resonance is the dominant feature one may conclude that from diffraction point of view the slits do not interact cannot see each other and act almost undisturbed in the formation of the transmission resonance found for the single slit in contrast abrupt changes of the field localization are evident when surface plasmons interact with fp resonances these variations can be linked in straightforward fashion to the strong perturbations of the diffraction efficiencies expected around the wood anomalies we observe that an enhanced reflection state from the grating the point in fig is very close to an enhanced transmission state the point on the same figure and that the light suppression effect has non negligible bandwidth of several tens of nanometers based on the plasmonic band gap features depicted in fig the point which is the wavelength of minimum transmission through the grating corresponds to the center of the plasmonic band gap point fig where the transmission through the grating is large corresponds to the plasmonic band edge inside the plasmonic band gap the propagation of surface modes is forbidden and at the band edge propagation is allowed and accompanied by low group velocities and strong field localization it is clear from the magnetic field localization that hybrid mode embracing the whole grating the sub wavelength slits and the metal air interfaces is resonating collectively allowing the transfer of light to the other side of the grating in fact the reader should observe that coupling between surface waves excited on each side of the grating can be achieved only through the slits given that the silver layer is much too thick nm to allow coupling through its bulk sections at the low energy plasmonic band edge transmission is prohibited but it is not due to the inhibition of surface modes rather it is due to phase shift in the field localization that occurs in going from one band edge to the other the interaction of surface plasmons with the grating leads to the formation of plasmonic band gap with suppressed transmission inside the gap and at one band edge and enhanced transmission at the other band edge as already demonstrated for light transmission through single apertures surrounded by periodic grooves leaky plasmons improve light coupling on the input interface and provide enhanced transmission and high broadside directivity at the exit interface of the grating the same mechanism mediates the formation of the modes and at the minimum point the incident light bends in front of the aperture and deflects back as if the grating were smooth surface the grating then acts as perfect mirror allowing the excitation of the unperturbed surface plasmon polariton with minimum located in front of the slit this causes subsequent re irradiation of light on the input side of the grating this virtually chokes the slits with surface resonant state later we will show how this effect persists regardless of slit thickness and impinging wavelength as long as the condition sp is satisfied absorption of and reflection of at point are consistent with values one expects from smooth free standing silver interface on the other hand absorption maxima occur at both the and states in particular joule heating is well confined within the slit for the fp resonance while it involves both the slits and the input and output interfaces at the state surface plasmon in the previous section we showed how the formation of the band gap is directly linked to the periodicity of the structure and how the fields localize across the forbidden region we also demonstrated how to manage the interaction of surface waves alongside cavity resonances figs by appropriately tuning the array periodicity another effective way to control the interaction is to tilt the structure and to scan the transmission at different incident angles unlike all the results reported so far the transmission response in fig is obtained by varying the wavelength and the angle of the incident plane wave the parameters of the array of fig are the same as those of figs we stress that the normal incidence transmission plotted in fig is sketched along the axis for angular frequencies between rad and rad and forms band gap around the zero transmission state at nm rad at least two more observations may be inferred by looking at fig by tilting the incident angle the plasmonic band gap can cross the cavity mode orders of the system and locate the zero transmission state at different wavelengths within the fabry perot cavity modes fp or fp in fig which are almost invariant with the incident angle ii the conditions for the potential excitation of the unperturbed smooth metal air interface surface plasmon ksp sin p denoted by the white curves on the map coincide systematically with the formation of transmission minimum equal to the point described in fig and fig however the position of the band gap created in the spectrum is not invariant with aperture size and helps to distinguish the roles of the wood anomaly and the sp in fig we report the transmission map on logarithmic scale obtained by varying incident wavelength and aperture size fixing film thickness to nm thick and pitch size nm the incident wavelength is varied near the characteristic wavelength that excites surface plasmon at an effective wavelength equal to pitch size aperture size or air filling ratio is varied from nm air filling ratio to nm air filling ratio transmission approaches by increasing the air filling ratio since we are reducing the amount of metal in the structure the most interesting feature of this map is the section highlighted by the dashed yellow and white lines both marked with the label in fig these lines correspond to the minimum transmission state described above occurring at sp according to the results presented in the previous sections the zero transmission state falls systematically at the wavelength where the grating wave vector excites the unperturbed surface plasmon as the air filling ratio increases and the structure becomes less metallic three effects take place the effective refractive index of the fundamental tm mode in the slit waveguide decreases and tends to unity all the fabry perot resonances shift toward shorter wavelengths ii the bandwidths of the fabry perot resonances are broader iii the condition for the minimum transmission state moves from the surface plasmon band gap dashed yellow line in fig to the classic rayleigh minimum condition dashed white line in fig occurring at following the minimum spectral position the transition from the plasmonic minimum dashed yellow line to the purely photonic minimum dashed white line is evident by looking at the slope of the white line starting from an air filling ratio of in other words the condition for the coupling and simultaneous back radiation due to the surface plasmon band gap at the input interface is preserved as long as the apertures are small enough nm for this particular grating under these circumstances the magnetic field always exhibits minimum at the center of the aperture see fig we also calculated the transmission response as function of both impinging wavelength and film thickness both aperture and pitch are constant and equal to nm and nm respectively in fig one may easily recognize some of the features of fig which was obtained for single aperture of the same size the first and the second order fabry perot modes occur at the same spectral positions and are altered only where they are crossed by the transverse resonating surface modes horizontal section sp highlighted in white moreover two regimes are distinguishable in this map separated by the vertical dashed line the region on the right denotes the thick film regime and is characterized by surface waves and fp resonances that interact via the guided modes of the slits in contrast in the left region e thin films the guided modes of the slits cannot resonate and the enhanced transmission is achieved only through evanescent wave coupling that takes place either inside the slits or through the bulk metal in particular in this regime the coupling of the input and output surface plasmons induces the formation of long and short range plasmons whose dispersion can be significantly distorted in summary we have analyzed several fundamental properties of enhanced transmission in metal gratings showing that it is possible to achieve full control of transmission efficiency the combined study of single slit system and its periodic counterpart reveals virtually identical spectral features except at wavelengths that nearly match the grating pitch in particular the effect of the interaction of fabry perot modes and surface modes is the opening of plasmonic band gap where the simultaneous coupling and back reflection at the surface plasmon band gap prevent light from coupling into the cavity mode inside the slit for incident wave vectors and grating pitches expected to exactly match and excite surface plasmon absorption is comparable to the bulk metal case of and transmission is suppressed by several orders of magnitude for gratings with an air filling factor we find that light flow through the slits is inhibited at the wavelength of the surface plasmon band gap for fill factors light flow tends to be inhibited at the classic wood rayleigh minimum condition on the other hand leaky surface plasmon waves excited by the grating act like vertical resonating modes that collect the impinging light and interact with fabry perot modes to form hybrid modes and trigger high transmission states at the plasmonic band edge the hybrid nature of these modes is confirmed by observing field localization properties and by mapping the behavior of the structure as function of the air filling ratio revealing their strong dependence on aperture size the opening of plasmonic band gap for surface waves in analogy of photonic band gaps for propagating waves could have important implications particularly in the nonlinear regime where band edge effects have been shown to exhibit enhanced nonlinear response the plasmonic band gap may be engineered for specific application for example in harmonic generation sensing and surface enhanced raman scattering sers to name few  the field of thin film photovoltaics has been recently enriched by the introduction of lead halide perovskites as absorber materials which allow low cost synthesis of solar cells with efficiencies exceeding the exact impact of the perovskite crystal structure and composition on the optoelectronic properties of the material are not fully understood our progress report highlights the knowledge gained about lead halide perovskites with focus on physical and optoelectronic properties we discuss the crystal and band structure of perovskite materials currently implemented in solar cells and the impact of the crystal properties on ferroelectricity ambipolarity and the properties of excitons the recent development of lead halide perovskite solar cells is remarkable the first results were published in with efficiencies close to using an electrolyte as hole transport material in two publications increased the efficiency peaking around using device geometries similar to solid state dye sensitized solar cell while both publications used mesoporous nanoparticle network the concepts were fundamentally different the gr tzel group used sintered tio nanoparticles as an electrode material while the snaith group replaced this material with nanostructured al film which only serves as scaffold layer and does not allow charge transport due to the insulating character of al in addition to the different nanostructure two different lead halide perovskites were used ch nh pbi and ch nh pbi xclx latest results explain why these two different concepts peak at similar conversion efficiencies up to in both cases the charge carrier diffusion length exceeds the absorption depth simultaneously allowing for highly efficient photon harvesting and small losses during charge collection however the charge generation and transport properties in lead halide perovskites are not fully understood within the last year several different concepts for the utilization of the unique properties of the lead halide perovskite were used such as thin film planar heterojunctions distributed heterojunctions with mesoporous tio zro and al nanostructures ordered tio and zno distributed heterojunctions and depleted heterojunctions the planar heterojunction design is mostly used for ch nh pbi xclx although in recent publication ch nh pbi has been used in planar heterojunction design which otherwise is still mainly applied on nanostructured tio electrodes the performance of perovskite solar cells strongly depends on the crystallinity of the perovskite layer recent results show that only minority of the perovskite in mesoporous nanostructure has medium range crystalline order while the majority consists of nanoparticle like perovskite crystallites in contrast to planar heterojunction cells where the crystallites are much larger several hundred nanometers up to micrometer scale for fabrication of different cells vapor deposition techniques as well as one and two step solution processed techniques have been used the fabrication was recently reviewed by snaith park and kim et al this research update discusses the interplay of the physical and electronic structure of lead halide perovskites with respect to their photovoltaic applications to date lead halide perovskites have been implemented in photovoltaics mainly as absorbers and in some cases as charge transport materials the perovskite structure is commonly understood as that of the mineral catio or more generally compound material of stoichiometry amx inorganic perovskites have three dimensional structures based on corner sharing anionic mx octahedra the atoms sit in the corners and the atom in middle of the octahedra the cations are located at interstices surrounded by octahedra in the cuboctahedral gap the perovskite only forms because there is large difference in sizes between the and cations majority of the known perovskite materials are fully inorganic g basno bifeo or srtio and feature wide range of properties such as piezo ferro and pyroelectricity giant magnetoresistance an abnormal photovoltaic effect and superconductivity for photovoltaic applications two types of perovskites are being used inorganic cssni as hole conducting material and lead halide perovskites with organic cations in case of the lead halide perovskites the lead and halide atoms form the inorganic octahedron acting as the anion while the organic cation g methylammonium ch nh resides in the interstices the structure of the inorganic organic perovskite is decisively determined by the size of the organic cation small cations like methylammonium maintain three dimensional structure of the perovskite larger cations g organic molecules containing phenyl groups will result in layered structure with inorganic sheets alternating with organic layers these sheets are connected by van der waals forces the lead halide perovskite ch nh pbi has four solid phases three of them perovskite like the perovskite phases are named with and and the non perovskite phase is the high temperature phase for temperatures k and has pseudocubical crystal structure scheme of the unit cell is shown in fig the inorganic perovskite cssni has cubic structure space group pm bar for the high temperature phase cubic structures allow only one formula unit per unit cell therefore perovskites with cations such as ch nh cannot obtain the cubic structure for temperatures lower than the perovskite undergoes phase transition to the tetragonal phase noncentrosymmetric space group cm with lattice parameters and the exact parameters depend on molecular orientation in the and phase the methylammonium cations are disordered ferroelectric response like capacitance and non ohmic behavior which might be responsible for hysteretic behavior in the current voltage curves could be attributed to the reorientation of the methylammonium cations in an external field and the resistance of the inorganic lead iodide lattice due to the tilting of the octahedra during the phase transition from to phase tilting angle at the unit cell doubles its length thus octupling its volume and forming super cell in fig a larger unit cell of the tetragonal phase of ch nh pbi is shown due to the tilting of the octahedra the bromine equivalent of ch nh pbi ch nh pbbr has cubic structure space group pm at room temperature the different structure arises from different ion sizes of bromine and iodine in six fold coordination for temperatures below the perovskite undergoes phase transition to orthorhombic phase space group pmc where the methylammonium cations are ordered during the phase transitions from to and the octahedra are tilted and deform from the ideal octahedron with respect to cubic phase for decreasing temperatures tilting and deformation effects increase phase transitions between the and phases occur in the solid phase while the transition to the non perovskite phase happens in the presence of solvents schematic phase diagram of the different perovskite phases is shown in fig the perovskite structure is based on ionic bonds in way that the total charge is balanced thus forming anionic corner connected inorganic octahedra via covalent bonds with organic cations in the cuboctahedral gap another structural effect arises from the stereochemical lone pair electrons these lone pair electrons influence the structure of the perovskite through the relocation of the lead atom which leads to variation of bonding length within the octahedra beyond the pure lead halide perovskites another type of perovskite was used for photovoltaic applications namely the mixed halide perovskite where the iodine is replaced partly with either chlorine ch nh pbi xclx which is derived from the pure halide perovskite ch nh pbi via apical substitution of the iodine atom with chlorine atom the incorporation of the chlorine atom adds small perturbation to the equatorial iodine atoms including small contraction of the octahedron the energy required for insertion of chlorine atom is mev the amount of chlorine included in the lead iodine perovskite is not clear yet the majority of literature found small amounts of chlorine in the perovskite in the range despite ch nh and pbcl with dimethylformamide dmf as solvent precursor ratio of for precursor ratio of separate ch nh pbcl phase can be observed separate phase for high chlorine concentrations and dmf as solvent indicates low solubility of chlorine in the iodine derivative supported by the segregated ch nh pbcl the use of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso as solvent enhances the amount of chlorine in the ch nh pbi xclx using dmso chlorine iodine ratio of was measured another mixed halide perovskite is ch nh pbi xbrx the energy required to insert bromine atom into the lead iodine lattice is smaller mev compared to the chlorine due to larger ion radii differences between iodine pm and chlorine pm compared to bromine pm the small energy enables the tuning of the bromine content between pure iodine perovskite and pure bromine perovskite when increasing the fraction of bromine the ch nh pbi xbrx perovskite undergoes phase transition from tetragonal to cubic ray diffraction indicates turnover fraction of about bromine in addition to the structural similarities of pure and mixed lead halide perovskites the electronic properties are very similar since the band structure close to the bandgap is dominated by lead and iodine orbitals this is result of the electronic structure of the organic inorganic perovskite with network formed of alternating organic cations and the inorganic octahedra the bandgap of the perovskite is dominated by the smaller energy gap of the inorganic lead halide lattice while the larger energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the organic cations have weaker contribution the conduction band minimum is dominated by non bonding orbitals of the lead the valence band maximum by anti bonding hybridized lead iodine orbitals bromine and chlorine states are located at energies below the valence band edge and do not contribute much in case of the mixed halide perovskites as determined via first principle investigations especially the type of halide cl br sitting in the apical positions of the octahedra has little contribution to the number of states near the band edges the molecular units of methylammonium form bonds deep in the valence band and do not hybridize with the inorganic octahedra for small bias thus providing mostly electrostatic charge compensation for the lead contribution the huge spin orbit coupling of the heavy lead atoms is even more important simulations show large difference for the bandgap with and without attention to the spin orbit coupling of the lead the energy difference between and level of the lead with and without recognition of the spin orbit coupling exceeds more than ev the large contribution of the spin orbit coupling to the conduction band maximum is another explanation why replacement of the apical atoms of the octahedron changes little in the band structure in addition to the spin orbit effects relativistic effects are also important for lead valence and conduction band near the band extrema deviate from the parabolic form resulting in dependence of effective masses of temperature and possible doping one possible doping mechanism has been suggested since photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show traces of metallic lead in both ch nh pbi and ch nh pbi xclx the reduction of lead might arise from loss of iodine atoms g through formation of the presence of traces of metallic lead could possibly introduce weakly bound electrons to the crystal e result in doping of the material the band composition due to the structure of the organic inorganic perovskite offers the possibility of bandgap engineering and tailoring of carrier mobility using either different organic cations or by variation of the inorganic lattice ch nh pbi is direct semiconductor with bandgap of ev with the conduction band minimum at ev and the valence band maximum at ev with respect to the vacuum level in fig calculated band structure for ch nh pbi using different algorithms is shown the bandgap for the quasiparticle self consistent gw approximation qsgw solid lines is slightly overestimated compared to experimental data ev while the local density approximation lda dashed line underestimates the bandgap energies when chlorine is incorporated in ch nh pbi the bandgap remains direct and increases slightly to ev with conduction band minimum of ev and valence band maximum of ev the energy difference between the fermi energy and the valence band maximum of ch nh pbi xclx chlorine ratio was measured to be ev indicating weak type or intrinsic semiconductor in contrast to ch nh pbi which was reported to be p type semiconductor the direct bandgaps of ch nh pbbr and ch nh pbcl are ev and ev respectively for direct comparison between ch nh pbi without chlorine and with chlorine with different precursor concentrations without any chloride precursor ratios ch nh pbcl and the bandgap for all perovskites is ev despite the larger bandgaps expected from the larger chlorine contribution the change of the bandgap due to the chlorine is within the tolerance of the optical measurement the reason for the reduced bandgap for higher chlorine concentrations stoichiometric ration of could be different structure of the perovskite for low chlorine concentrations density functional theory calculations indicate more disordered structure compared to higher concentrations in contrast to the relatively small changes in bandgaps in iodine chlorine perovskite the combination of iodine and bromine as halides in ch nh pbi xbrx allows for the tuning of the bandgap between and ev due to the small replacement energy of iodine atoms with bromine recently published combination of chlorine bromine perovskite ch nh pbbr xclx can increase the bandgap even further in addition to the variation of the bandgap by using different configurations of the inorganic octahedra of the perovskite the organic cation offers another setscrew for the energy gap replacement of the methylammonium cation with formamidinium cation hc nh reduced the bandgap to ev due to change of the bond lengths of the inorganic octahedra the bromide equivalent has bandgap of ev very high open circuit voltages up to ev have been measured for halide perovskite solar cells loss in potential of ev is slightly smaller than for the best inorganic materials like gaas or crystalline silicon the origin of this low loss in potential is not fully understood yet and currently under investigation by different groups the intrinsic carrier density in the lead halide perovskite was measured to be cm similar to intrinsic semiconductors like silicon however the electron mobility is much lower with cm vs recent measurements for the charge mobility in ch nh pbi xclx set lower bound of cm vs upon replacement of the lead with tin to form ch nh sni bandgap ev depending on preparation the calculated carrier mobility increases drastically electron mobility cm vs hole mobility cm vs this more metal like behaviour can be attributed to oxidation of tin atoms in contrast to the lead atoms which are unable to be oxidized in the iodine environment the energy bands of the lead halide perovskites represent the ambipolar characteristic since valence band and conduction band are almost mirrored theoretical estimation of the effective masses for electrons and holes in ch nh pbi in the pseudo cubic phase at the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum including the effects of spin orbit coupling results in me and mh these predicted effective masses do not include elastic scattering effects they therefore correspond to maximum effective mass with minimal scattering effects the diffusion length ld is calculated from the equation d sqrt tau ld e where is the diffusion constant and the recombination lifetime without photoluminescence quenching material which is fitted from the photoluminescence decay shown in figs and the diffusion length measured via photoluminescence decay experiments for electrons and holes in the mixed halide perovskite ch nh pbi xclx are and respectively the diffusion length of both charge carriers for ch nh pbi was measured to be around slightly larger for electrons than for holes ch nh pbi xclx has much larger recombination lifetime than ch nh pbi the difference is more than an order of magnitude for perovskite on glass embedded in poly methylmethacrylate pmma while the addition of electron and hole acceptor materials accelerates the photoluminescence for both perovskites the quenched fraction of photoluminescence of ch nh pbi xclx is much higher this result agrees with the higher estimated effective masses for holes compared to electrons it has to be noted that these results were not measured using complete device but perovskite and electron or hole transport layers measurements using electron beam induced current ebic of complete devices show much larger diffusion length for ch nh pbi figs and show scanning electron microscopy images and ebic for pure and mixed halide perovskites the ebic measurement of ch nh pbi xclx and ch nh pbi show current generation in the entire absorber charge separation occurs in the ch nh pbi xclx layer with two maxima indicated by the green and blue arrows these maxima at the absorber hole conductor interface green and absorber electron conductor blue show the prime charge separation regions in the device with the peak at the absorber hole conductor slightly higher than at the absorber electron conductor interface for ch nh pbi the peak of charge separation at the absorber electron conductor interface green dominates the absorber hole conductor interface blue for ch nh pbi xclx measurements of the diffusion length using results from ebic indicate an effective diffusion length of for electrons and for holes comparison of the ebic measurement for ch nh pbi xclx and ch nh pbi indicates larger diffusion length for holes compared to electrons much larger than reported by stranks et al or xing et al comparison of the diffusion length obtained from photoluminescence decay and ebic measurement show higher diffusion length of ch nh pbi xclx compared to ch nh pbi but indicate that the transport properties of perovskite are not fully understood the mechanism of chlorine incorporation better crystal formation or actual doping also remains unclear however as noted above an increased conductivity inverse series resistance was measured for the mixed halide with low chlorine percentage in ch nh pbi xclx indicating doping measurements of the diffusion length via photoluminescence decay for the formamidinium perovskite hc nh pbi gives electron diffusion length of nm and hole diffusion length of nm recent results of impedance spectroscopy measurements indicate that the combination of mesoporous tio nanostructure and ch nh pbi enhances the diffusion length of charge carriers comparable to ch nh pbi xclx which explains similar performance values for the highest developed solar cells for both designs the exciton binding energy of the perovskite is related to the dielectric response of the material and there is evidence that the nature of the exciton in the perovskite is more wannier like simulated values for the static and high frequency constant are similar to values of other bulk absorber materials used for photovoltaic applications like cdte exciton binding energies were measured to be between and mev for the low temperature phase of ch nh pbi ch nh pbi xclx and ch nh pbi in mesoporous nanostructure both show strong photoluminescence peak between and nm associated with stimulated emission of the perovskite fitting the integration of the photoluminescence for temperatures down to still the tetragonal phase for ch nh pbi xclx indicates higher exciton binding energies of about mev assuming that the photoluminescence is dominated by exciton recombination for bulk ch nh pbi no photoluminescence could be detected indicating no significant radiative recombination other effects like frequency shift of the absorption onset between bulk perovskite and perovskite in mesoporous film quantum confinement or dielectric environment of the mesoporous film also need to be considered for comparison of the different results of the binding energy as well as the increased defect and surface related recombination for perovskite in mesoporous nanostructures however the absence of photoluminescence for bulk ch nh pbi indicates the direct generation of free charge carriers upon illumination the corresponding bohr radius for the lower exciton binding energy of about mev would be thus covering the area of more than two unit cells of the pseudo cubic structure the bohr radius could explain quantum confinement effects in the mesoporous film since the pore size is similar to the bohr radius for one and two dimensional perovskites with larger organic cations the binding energy is much larger compared to the three dimensional perovskites since quantum confinement in the few layer quantum well structures has stronger influence on the excitons since the methylammonium cations are polar by themselves and bonded via hydrogen bonds and ionic effects they can easily reorient within the lattice of inorganic octahedra the reorientation of the dipoles and lattice distortion due to the polar nature of the octahedra are the origin of some effects of the lead halide perovskites for instance the absolute resistance shows non ohmic hysteresis which can be attributed to the reorientation of the methylammonium cations of the perovskite under the influence of an external field these ferroelectric effects introduce inductance and or capacitance within the system producing large density of states within the perovskite which separates this system from the class of hybrid dye sensitized solar cells in addition to the polar nature of the lattice itself the polarity of the organic cations has number of important effects on solar cell performance the electronic polarization of ch nh pbi and hc nh pbi is comparable to the polarization of materials which show above bandgap voltages charge carriers in ferroelectric material like perovskite can diffuse via grain boundaries to the electrodes of the device as reported by choi et al large fraction of the perovskite consists of small crystallites which could form ferroelectric domains in multi domain perovskite crystal electrons would move along the minima of the electric field and holes along the maxima thus reducing recombination due to spatial separation of the charge carriers as an external field would influence domain orientation and charge density at the boundaries hysteretical behaviour could be expected at the moment however the influence of the ferroelectricity of lead halide perovskites on the device function is not understood and further research is necessary in order to shed light on ferroelectric phenomena in perovskite photovoltaics the interplay between physical and electronic structure of lead halide perovskites has huge effects on the properties of the material table summarizes structure and bandgap for lead halide perovskites although pure as well as mixed lead halide perovskites have been successfully implemented in high efficiency photovoltaic devices the incorporation mechanism of chlorine into the pure halide perovskite ch nh pbi and its effects are not clear yet understanding the effects of added chlorine to the perovskite such as increased carrier diffusion length and conductivity in combination with nearly identical bandgap is essential for further development of metal organic halide perovskites for solar cell applications taking advantage of the good control over the doping level of these materials could allow the fabrication of n junction perovskite cells and open new synthesis routes aside inorganic organic or depleted inorganic heterojunction devices perovskite homojunction cell is potentially easier to fabricate and might help to further lower the projected mass production costs of this fascinating technology furthermore deeper understanding of the impact of the perovskite composition on the crystal formation and the electronic structure of the material will enable the optimization of current lead halide perovskites and will very likely allow efficiencies exceeding in the near future more importantly the knowledge gained about the lead halide perovskites can be possible transferred to lead free perovskites which are the next logical step towards non toxic low cost high efficiency materials for thin film photovoltaics  modern wind farms comprised of horizontal axis wind turbines hawts require significant land resources to separate each wind turbine from the adjacent turbine wakes this aerodynamic constraint limits the amount of power that can be extracted from given wind farm footprint the resulting inefficiency of hawt farms is currently compensated by using taller wind turbines to access greater wind resources at high altitudes but this solution comes at the expense of higher engineering costs and greater visual acoustic radar and environmental impacts we investigated the use of counter rotating vertical axis wind turbines vawts in order to achieve higher power output per unit land area than existing wind farms consisting of hawts full scale field tests of tall vawts in various counter rotating configurations were conducted under natural wind conditions during summer whereas modern wind farms consisting of hawts produce of power per square meter of land area these field tests indicate that power densities an order of magnitude greater can potentially be achieved by arranging vawts in layouts that enable them to extract energy from adjacent wakes and from above the wind farm moreover this improved performance does not require higher individual wind turbine efficiency only closer wind turbine spacing and sufficient vertical flux of turbulence kinetic energy from the atmospheric surface layer the results suggest an alternative approach to wind farming that has the potential to concurrently reduce the cost size and environmental impacts of wind farms principal challenge for all forms of renewable energy is that their sources solar radiation or wind for example are more diffuse than fossil fuels as consequence existing renewable energy technologies require substantial land resources in order to extract appreciable quantities of energy this limitation of land use is especially acute in the case of wind energy which currently faces an additional constraint in that conventional propeller style wind turbines e horizontal axis wind turbines henceforth hawts must be spaced far apart in order to avoid aerodynamic interference caused by interactions with the wakes of adjacent turbines this requirement has forced wind energy systems away from high energy demand population centers and toward remote locations including more recently offshore sites it has also necessitated the implementation of very large wind turbines so that the inefficiency of the wind farm as whole can be compensated by accessing the greater wind resources available at high altitudes however this solution comes at the expense of higher engineering costs and greater visual acoustic radar and environmental impacts these issues represent principal barrier to the realization of wind energy technology that is both economically viable and socially acceptable to maintain of the performance of isolated hawts the turbines in hawt farm must be spaced turbine diameters apart in the cross wind direction and diameters apart in the downwind direction the power density of such wind farms defined as the power extracted per unit land area is between and m wind turbines whose airfoil blades rotate around vertical axis e vertical axis wind turbines henceforth vawts have the potential to achieve higher power densities than hawts this possibility arises in part because the swept area of vawt rotor e the cross sectional area that interacts with the wind need not be equally apportioned between its breadth which determines the size of its footprint and its height by contrast the circular sweep of hawt blades dictates that the breadth and height of the rotor swept area are identical therefore whereas increasing hawt rotor swept area necessarily increases the turbine footprint it is possible to increase the swept area of vawt independent of its footprint by increasing the rotor blade height table compares the power density of commercially available vawt with two common hawt models the power density of the vawt design is more than three times that of the hawts suggesting that vawts may be more effective starting point than hawts for the design of wind farms with high power density the turbine power densities indicated in table are not achieved in practice due to the aforementioned spacing requirements between the turbines in wind farm however we hypothesized that counter rotating arrangements of vawts can benefit from constructive aerodynamic interactions between adjacent turbines thereby mitigating reductions in the performance of the turbines when in close proximity by accommodating larger number of vawts within given wind farm footprint the power density of the wind farm is increased furthermore by capturing greater proportion of the wind energy incident on the wind farm footprint it becomes unnecessary to use wind turbines as large as those commonly found in modern hawt farms in turn the use of smaller turbines can reduce the complexity and cost of the individual wind turbines since the smaller wind turbines do not experience the high gravitational centrifugal and wind loading that must be withstood by large hawts the less severe design requirements can enable the implementation of less expensive materials and manufacturing processes here we present an initial study of this concept of counter rotating vawt farms by measuring wind turbine performance at full scale and in naturally occurring wind conditions although field measurements lack the controllable environment of scale model experiments in wind tunnel or numerical simulations they do provide the most direct support of the validity of the proposed wind farm concept the data set presented here can also be used as baseline for comparison with future scale model experiments and numerical simulations experiments were conducted at field site in the antelope valley of northern los angeles county california usa the site is vacant desert and the topography is flat for approximately km in all directions figure over the duration of these experiments from june to september the mean wind speed was approximately s at with mean turbulence fluctuations e standard deviation of s figure plots the daily average wind speed and turbulence fluctuations during the course of the experiments figure plots the distribution of wind direction at the site the prevailing wind is from the southwest the natural variability of the wind direction enabled the sensitivity of turbine performance to wind direction to be studied without requiring large number of discrete turbine configurations to be tested see vawt positioning and protocols below wind turbine the field tests utilized six tall diameter vawts the turbines were modified version of commercially available model windspire energy inc with span airfoil blades and w generator connected to the base of the turbine shaft three of the turbines rotated around their central shaft in clockwise direction g from top view in the winds above s the other three rotated in counter clockwise direction when the wind speed exceeded the same threshold henceforth the cut in wind speed each of the experiments was conducted with the turbines positioned within the same m tract of land one of the six turbines remained fixed in the same location for all of the experiments the remaining turbines were manually repositioned on portable footings in order to create the various configurations studied the schedule of turbine positions is listed in table ii along with the number of hours that each turbine configuration was measured the rotational speed and electrical power generated by each turbine were monitored in real time and recorded at hz using custom software designed to interface with the turbines windsync windspire energy inc measurement accuracy was for both parameters each measurement was assigned time stamp that was synchronized with separately collected meteorological data see the meteorological measurements section below and was manually uploaded via satellite uplink hughesnet from the field site to computer at the california institute of technology where the data were analyzed m meteorological tower was erected at the northwest corner of the field site in order to measure the wind speed and direction at height comparable to the mid span height of the vawt blades the tower was located turbine diameters northwest e approximately cross wind of the nearest vawt to ensure that it did not affect the wind conditions near the turbines although the need to avoid aerodynamic interference between the meteorological tower and the vawts precluded wind measurements using the tower closer to the turbines the difference in their position was significantly smaller than the length scale over which mean flow in the atmospheric surface layer changes to be sure the turbulence fluctuations which were typically of the mean wind speed likely overwhelm the differences between the instantaneous wind speed at the location of the meteorological tower and at the turbines the accuracy of the wind speed sensor thies first class and wind direction sensor met one measurements was and respectively data from the meteorological tower were recorded at hz using datalogger campbell scientific the data were assigned timestamp synchronized with the turbine measurement data before transmission via the satellite uplink the turbine power coefficient is defined as the fraction of incident kinetic energy passing through the swept area of the turbine rotor that is converted to electrical energy in terms of the generated electrical power air density turbine rotor swept area equal to the product of the turbine rotor diameter and height and wind speed the power coefficient is cp au where the air density was estimated to be kg and the turbine rotor swept area is wind farm the wind farm power density is defined as the electrical power generated by the wind farm divided by the area of its footprint in terms of the turbine rated power capacity factor wind farm aerodynamic loss factor wind turbine spacing and wind turbine diameter the wind farm power density is wpd pc sd where the factor arises due to the assumption that each turbine has circular footprint with diameter d inside which no other turbines can be located in the first set of experiments we measured the performance of two counter rotating vawts whose axes of rotation were separated by turbine diameters figure the clockwise rotating turbine denoted cw was measured at multiple positions around the azimuth of the counter clockwise rotating turbine denoted ccw in order to determine the dependence of turbine performance on the relative direction of the incident wind in addition the performance of turbine ccw was measured while it was isolated e separated by turbine diameters from turbine cw in order to evaluate the effect of the close proximity of the turbines on the power coefficient e the fraction incident wind energy that is converted to electrical energy denoted cp normalized power coefficient cpnorm defined as the ratio of the turbine power coefficient in the counter rotating configuration to the power coefficient of the isolated turbine was used to evaluate the performance of each configuration the normalized power coefficient of turbine ccw and by spatial symmetry the normalized power coefficient of turbine cw was nearly insensitive to the incident wind direction over the of wind direction variation that was observed figure averaged over all incident wind directions the close proximity of the turbines slightly improved their performance relative to the turbines in isolation figure this is in contrast to typical performance reductions between and for hawts at similar turbine spacing the result is qualitatively consistent with the predictions of previous simplified numerical models which anticipated that closely spaced vawts can reciprocally enhance the wind field of the adjacent turbines in second set of experiments we studied the performance of third vawt placed diameters downwind from two counter rotating vawts with the same spacing figure these experiments explored the effect of downwind blockage caused by the two closely spaced upwind turbines we observed significant decrease in the performance of the downwind turbine especially at higher ratios of rotor blade tip speed to wind speed henceforth tip speed ratio however when the spacing of the downwind turbine was increased to four diameters its performance was recovered to within of the isolated turbine performance across the range of observed tip speed ratios figure this rapid recovery of the downwind flow field is in marked contrast to the diameters of downwind spacing found to be required for similar level of wake recovery in recent numerical simulation of large hawt based on the preceding experiments we hypothesized that by increasing the mean spacing of all turbines in an array to four diameters upstream blockage effects would be significantly reduced figure illustrates the wind farm configuration implemented in field tests nearest neighbor turbines were counter rotating in order to take advantage of the lesser aerodynamic interference between counter rotating vawts as compared to co rotating vawts the field tests confirmed that each of the downwind turbines in the array achieved performance comparable to the vawt at the front of the array figure the performance of the turbine located five positions downwind from the front of the array was reduced by less than relative to the farthest upwind turbine which is within the measurement uncertainty averaged over the footprint of the six turbine vawt array the daily mean power density produced by the array varied from to m at wind speeds above cut in and m overall figure this performance significantly exceeded the m power density of modern hawt farms despite the relatively low mean wind speed during this set of field tests s to be sure practical limitations on the number of vawts in the field tests precluded direct evaluation of turbines surrounded on all sides by neighboring vawts as would be the case for the majority of turbines in wind farm to extrapolate the present measurements to larger vawt farms we considered the present vawt diameter and inter turbine spacing diameters and we made conservative estimates for both the total aerodynamic loss in the array and the capacity factor e the ratio of actual power output to the maximum generator power output the calculated power density for vawt farm with these parameters is approximately m cf eq this performance is times the power density of modern wind farms that utilize hawts furthermore it is straightforward to compute the combinations of vawt rated power output and turbine spacing that can achieve m e times modern hawt farms by using diameter vawts like those studied here figure higher vawt rated power outputs can be achieved by using taller turbine rotors than the structures used in these experiments and by connecting the turbine shaft to larger generators indeed in initial field tests with tall rotors the captured wind power exceeded the capacity of the generator on each turbine the large increases in wind farm power density demonstrated here may be surprising when one considers that the efficiency e power coefficient of modern hawts approaches the theoretical upper limit of aerodynamic efficiency for isolated hawts the present results suggest that the physical limit on wind energy extraction using the vawt array approach is not the individual turbine efficiency as is the case for well spaced hawts that essentially operate in isolation within wind farm instead wind energy extraction is limited by the wind resource itself especially the horizontal wind speed and the vertical flux of turbulence kinetic energy required to transport wind energy to turbines downwind from the front of the wind farm this upper limit which is based on properties of the atmospheric surface layer and the surface roughness created by the wind turbines themselves supersedes the theoretical limit on isolated hawt efficiency as the primary determinant of maximum vawt farm performance stated differently although individual vawts often exhibit lower power coefficients than hawts this deficiency is compensated indeed overcompensated by the fact that vawts can be placed closer together the wind energy that is not extracted by one vawt due to its inefficiency can be collected by an adjacent vawt in close proximity to quantify the upper limit on wind energy extraction from vawt arrays we considered the horizontal e from upwind and vertical e from above fluxes of kinetic energy into the wind farm these power sources denoted phorz and pvert respectively can be estimated as phorz afrontalu pvert aplanformu w where is the air density is the mean horizontal wind speed is the horizontal turbulence velocity fluctuation is the vertical turbulence velocity fluctuation is the frontal or planform e top view area respectively and the angle brackets denote an ensemble average the reynolds stress w can be estimated in terms of the friction velocity as w u ln d where is von karman constant is the height above the ground and and are respectively the zero plane displacement e the effective height at which the surface roughness acts and roughness length of the vawt array per convention the values of and are taken as and of the turbine height respectively for the present experiments wherein kg and m at above the ground averaged over all field tests see materials and methods the input flux of kinetic energy from upwind is approximately m of frontal area this frontal kinetic energy flux will limit the performance of vawts near the front of the array however the majority of the turbines in large vawt farm will be limited by the lower planform kinetic energy flux from above the wind farm figure indicates that the wind farm power density is correlated with and indeed bounded by the planform kinetic energy flux above the wind farm the mean wind speed will be reduced from its upwind value due to the elevated surface friction caused by the presence of the wind turbines figure plots the planform kinetic energy flux model from eqs and as function of the ratio of the reduced mean wind speed ur to the unperturbed wind speed i in the absence of the wind farm for comparison the nominal performance of modern hawt farms is also shown the results suggest that as long as the wind speed above the wind farm remains greater than of the unperturbed wind the vawt farm performance upper bound dictated by the planform kinetic energy flux exceeds the performance of current hawt farms for ur the vawt farm planform kinetic flux is an order of magnitude greater than the performance of modern hawt farms the present measurements are insufficient to determine the range of ur that can be achieved in practice for large scale vawt farms the value will depend on the local stability of the atmospheric surface layer the spatial density and height profile of the vawts and their effective drag properties further study of the interplay among these parameters is essential and is focus of ongoing and future research by including periodic gaps of larger downwind spacing and or turbine height variations between clusters of downwind vawts it may also be possible to prevent saturation of the frontal kinetic energy flux without significantly compromising the gains in wind farm power density with regard to the former strategy of downwind spacing we verified that by removing the turbine immediately upwind of the rearmost vawt in the present array its performance was further improved figure red dash dot curve counter rotation of adjacent vawts is important because it ensures that the airflow induced by each of the turbines in the region between them is oriented in the same direction refs and see also figure hence the creation of horizontal wind shear e velocity gradients which leads to turbulence and energy dissipation in the region between the turbines is reduced relative to adjacent turbines that rotate in the same direction since the remaining wind energy between the turbines is not dissipated by turbulence it can be subsequently extracted by vawts located further downwind this process is most effective for vawts operating at higher tip speed ratios e greater than since in this regime the turbine rotation can suppress vortex shedding and turbulence in the wake in manner similar to that observed in previous studies of spinning cylinders at lower tip speed ratios the vawts likely create larger wake akin to that of stationary cylinder we observed correspondingly reduced performance in the present field tests the overall approach described presently is fundamentally different from current practices in wind energy harvesting here large number of smaller vawts are implemented instead of fewer large hawts the higher levels of turbulence near the ground both naturally occurring and induced by the vawt configuration enhance the vertical flux of kinetic energy delivered to the turbines thereby facilitating their close spacing this approach has the potential to concurrently alleviate many of the practical challenges associated with large hawts such as the cost and logistics of their manufacture transportation and installation g by using less expensive materials and manufacturing processes and by exploiting greater opportunities for mass production environmental impacts g bird and bat strikes acoustic and radar signatures g lower tip speed ratios than hawts ref visual signature figure and general acceptance by local communities these issues although not strictly scientific limit the further expansion of existing wind energy technology the present results encourage search for optimal configurations of counter rotating vawts that can improve upon the power density achieved here such optimal solutions may achieve enhanced turbine performance in close proximity g figure while minimizing downwind blockage effects and enhancing the vertical flux of kinetic energy via manipulation of the zero plane displacement and roughness length of the vawt array finally we note that the energy harvesting principles developed here are equally applicable to underwater turbines in the ocean  we review the current status of single photon source and single photon detector technologies operating at wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the infrared we discuss applications of these technologies to quantum communication field currently driving much of the development of single photon sources and detectors what is a photon is defined as an elementary excitation of single mode of the quantized electromagnetic field the concept of quantized electromagnetic radiation was first introduced by planck in to explain the black body radiation spectrum it was also used by einstein in to explain the photoelectric effect and by compton in to explain the wavelength shift of scattered rays the term photon was first introduced by n lewis in the formal quantization of the electromagnetic field was first performed by dirac in the mode of the quantized electromagnetic field is labeled by its frequency and single photon in mode has energy equal to k where is planck constant while the monochromatic definition of photon implies delocalization in time in practice one often talks about propagating single photon states that are localized to some degree in time and space mathematically one can describe such states as superpositions of monochromatic photon modes much discussion can be found in the literature about the definition of photon wavefunction for the purposes of this review we adopt the following operational definition of single photon state given detector that can determine the number of incident photons in some finite width frequency range with accuracy single photon state is an excitation of the electromagnetic field localized to some degree in both space and time such that the detector measures exactly one photon for each incident state put another way single photon state is one for which the photon number statistics have mean value of one photon and variance of zero in addition since the results of quantum measurements may depend on the measurement procedure and apparatus the physics of the measurement process itself must also be considered single photon detectors typically work by sensing an electrical signal that results from the absorption of photon why produce and detect single major driver of the current research into single photon sources and single photon detectors is the explosive growth of the field of quantum information science over the last few decades at its core quantum information science involves the encoding communication manipulation and measurement of information using quantum mechanical objects research has shown that using quantum objects for this purpose allows certain computational tasks to be performed more efficiently than thought possible using classical objects and potentially allows unconditionally secure communication photonic qubits where information is encoded in the quantum state of the photon using degrees of freedom such as polarization momentum energy etc are an ideal choice for many of these applications since photons travel at the speed of light and interact weakly with their environment over long distances which results in lower noise and loss and photons can be manipulated with linear optics while quantum communication applications often make use of single photons many quantum cryptography protocols in the form of quantum key distribution qkd in particular demand single photons traveling over channel as more than one photon can compromise the security of the communication by allowing an eavesdropper to gain information while subsequent schemes such as those that rely on decoy states and privacy amplification have been shown to relax this single photon requirement and to reduce the potential leakage of information to an eavesdropper quantum cryptography has been significant driver of single photon source development and certainly it is the case that long distance qkd which requires quantum repeaters is likely to rely heavily on single photons some quantum computation protocols also require single photons and in addition require that all single photons used in the protocol be indistinguishable from one another because these quantum protocols require single photons it is advantageous to employ single photon detectors that ideally can determine the number of photons in given pulse another single photon detection application that has come out of qkd but has applications in other non quantum related fields is the production of truly random numbers light provides natural solution to this problem where single photons encountering beamsplitter exhibit inherent quantum randomness in which output path they take extracting this path information requires single photon detection these requirements coupled with the strong growth of quantum information applications fig have provided motivation for the development of improved single photon sources and single photon detectors in addition to quantum information science single photon detectors are used for wide range of applications including bioluminescence detection dna sequencing rster resonance energy transfer fret for studying protein folding light detection and ranging lidar for remote sensing and light ranging on shorter scales optical time domain reflectometry picosecond imaging circuit analysis single molecule spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime measurements medical applications such as diffuse optical tomography and positron emission tomography and finally applications such as traditional and quantum enabled metrology this review attempts to describe the state of the art of single photon sources and detectors over the broad range of fields in which these technologies are employed we have attempted to make the review accessible to those who are new to the field while at the same time serving as valuable reference to experts more specific reviews focused on quantum metrology applications quantum information applications fluorescence lifetime determina tion quantum dot photonic crystal sources single emitter sources cavity based sources single photon sources generally and solid state single photon detec tors may also be of interest to the reader brief history of single photon sources and historically the first detectors able to register single optical photons were photomultiplier tubes pmts which combined the photoelectric cell with an electron multiplier while early on hertz studied the effect of light on an electrical discharge and others developed what evolved into the photoelectric cell see for example the work of elster and geitel it was not until the development of the electron multiplier that the signal from single photon could be observed as part of an intense race to develop workable electronic television photosensitive element and an electron multiplier were combined in the by iams and salzberg and zworykin at rca and kubetsky in the former soviet union the pmt first demonstrated single photon sensitivity very soon after these developments it was not until the work of mcintyre on geiger mode avalanche photodiodes apds in the mid that the possibility of solid state optical single photon detection became reality these apds when they are designed and fabricated specifically to operate as single photon detectors rather than as analog detectors are referred to as single photon avalanche diodes spads silicon based spads enabled visible photon counting with high efficiency and low noise relative to analog semiconductor detectors however spad development has been much more difficult in the infrared ir where the competing requirements of material with good ir absorption and low noise gain tend to be mutually exclusive as result ir spads are inferior to si spads in all characteristics although there are significant efforts focused on addressing this problem the surge of research interest in the field of quantum information over the last few decades led to concomitant surge in research into single photon sources and single photon detectors this growth is clear from the citation database search results shown in fig an ideal single photon source would be one for which single photon can be emitted at any arbitrary time defined by the user e the source is deterministic or on demand the probability of emitting single photon is the probability of multiple photon emission is subsequent emitted photons are indistinguishable and the repetition rate is arbitrarily fast limited only by the temporal duration of the single photon pulses perhaps deviations from these ideal characteristics which are always present in real world sources must be considered when designing experiments in sec ii we consider deterministic single photon sources based on color centers quantum dots qds single atoms single ions single molecules and atomic ensembles all of which can to some degree emit single photons on demand in sec ii we describe probabilistic single photon sources these sources rely on photons created in pairs via parametric downconversion pdc in bulk crystals and waveguides and four wave mixing fwm in optical fibers for these sources the creation of photon pairs is probabilistic rather than deterministic however because the photons are created in pairs one photon the heralding photon can be used to herald the creation of the other photon the heralded single photon we would like to highlight here that while the distinction between deterministic and probabilistic source is clear in the abstract that this distinction blurs in practice an example of this is seen when source classified as deterministic has loss in the extraction of the photon from the region where it is generated as that emission or extraction loss increases theoretically deterministic source becomes more probabilistic in operation keeping this caveat in mind these terms are helpful descriptors and thus we will use them section ii considers unique approaches to single photon sources including carbon nanotubes quantum interference and two photon absorption in table we list various types of single photon sources and some relevant parameters with which to make comparisons and to get feel for what is possible with each source type in sec iv we discuss the importance of multi photon emission to an application of quantum information science and the experimental status of single photon sources for quantum information protocols before moving on to discuss the current state of the art in single photon source research it is necessary to introduce common tool for characterizing the single photon nature of the emission of source the second order correlation function by single photon nature of the emission field of source we mean the probability of multiple photon emission relative to the probability of single photon emission an ideal single photon source would emit single photon every time with zero probability of multiple photon emission photon source can be characterized using the second order correlation function documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation vec vec t langle hat vec t hat vec t rangle over langle hat vec t rangle langle hat vec t rangle end equation

document hat dag end document in many quantum optics experiments non polarizing beamsplitter is used to divide the photon field into two equal parts with each of them individually photo detected such setup is referred to as hanbury brown twiss interferometer for an ideal single photon emitter the cross correlation function for the two outputs of the beamsplitter is with g because after emission of single photon the emitter must be excited again before second photon can be emitted it can never emit two photons at the same time in practice the time response of the detectors will determine minimum that can be measured even with an ideal source for comparison and completeness an ideal laser is source of photons where each emission is independent of all other emission events and for and for all we note that in some applications low multi photon emission is the critical requirement rather than low and thus an attenuated laser due to its convenience is often employed there are variety of systems that have been investigated for use as on demand sources of single photons most of these are single emitter quantum systems shown idealistically in fig with two internal levels such as semiconductor quantum dots mesoscopic quantum wells single molecules single atoms single ions and color centers while each of these single emitter approaches uses different material system most rely on similar principles of operation when single photon emission is desired some external control is used to put the system into an excited state that will emit single photon upon relaxation to some lower energy state often coupling techniques using optical cavities are used to engineer the emission characteristics single neutral atoms single atom emitters are designed to work in the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics where the single photon profoundly impacts the dynamics of the atom cavity system and the optical cavity greatly enhances single photon emission into single spatial mode with gaussian transverse profile the operation of single atom emitter requires tour de force experimental effort to date alkali atoms such as cs and rb have been used atoms are first captured and cooled inside magneto optical trap mot after the mot is turned off the atoms fall freely under the pull of gravity when atoms pass through high finesse optical cavity an optical trap is turned on for single atom emitter it is important to have only one atom trapped inside the cavity the atom has type energy level system or similar consisting of two metastable ground states and and one excited state the resonance of the optical cavity is made close to the transition of e and the transition of e is on resonance with the pump laser pulse the system consisting of the atom and the optical mode of the cavity with state atomic state photon number leads to level hamiltonian system with states u and with appropriate control of the pump laser pulse and atom cavity coupling the atomic state can be coherently transferred to state via stimulated raman adiabatic passage stirap during the process of stirap single photon is emitted in the cavity mode which couples to the external field through one of the cavity mirrors the atom cavity mode is now in the state which must be recycled to the state for the next run of single photon emission the efficiency of single photon generation for this approach can be close to unity within an experimental uncertainty of although losses on exiting the system can be considerable yielding in one example an emission probability of with g the coherent process is reversible and the source can work both as single photon emitter and receiver and because atoms are all identical atom based sources could be produced in quantity for scalable system although the experimental overhead would be formidable despite these advantages single atom emitters are compromised by limited trapping time fluctuating atom cavity mode coupling that can yield decoherence effects although these effects can be made small and possible multi atom effects all of these issues need to be resolved before single atoms can be used as true on demand sources of single photons and nodes in quantum networks single ions ions used as single photon emitters also have type energy level configuration e with two ground states and one excited state while both far off resonant raman scattering and small detuning from resonance stirap were proposed for single photon generation the raman scattering path may offer higher single photon emission probability the use of radio frequency ion trap can stably localize the single ion in the center of the optical cavity with the capability of confining the ion motion wavepacket to much smaller than the optical wavelength and fixing the wavepacket position with precision of few nanometers this overcomes the issues encountered by single neutral atom emitters and ensures continuous production of single photon pulses with only single ion trapped inside the cavity the possibility of multiple photon events is eliminated however because the resonance transitions of ions are in the ultraviolet region the excited states have strong spontaneous decay rates that compete with the emission of radiation into the cavity mode in addition the ion may remain in the ground state at the end of the excitation pulse without emitting single photon these factors can seriously reduce the probability of emitting single photon during each pump cycle as with single neutral atoms single ions as the basis of single photon source have the advantage that they are all identical and thus indistinguishability between different sources and different pulses from the same source is not an issue in addition achieving low levels of multi photon emission and low decoherence do not seem to be inherent problems with ion based systems while significant progress has been made to manipulate several ions into single system for quantum information applications with separate areas for storage and processing all important steps toward truly scalable system there are significant problems still to be faced one such problem concerns how efficiently light can be collected as the usual solution using strong cavity coupling is difficult with charged particle single molecules since the first observation of photon anti bunching in single molecule system single photon emission by single molecules has been extensively studied by many groups in solid and liquid hosts at both cryogenic and room temperatures the molecular electron transition involved can be approximated by level system which consists of singlet ground state a singlet excited state and triplet intermediate state each state represents set of vibrational energy levels an electron in vibrational level of the ground state is optically transferred to vibrational level in the excited state and then radiatively de excites back to the ground state vibrational manifold thus the single photon emission spans broad spectrum the single photon emission repetitively occurs while the cycling of s continues until the electron transitions to the dark state which normally occurs with small probability electrons staying in the dark state lower the emission rate of single photons and contribute to bunching on longer time scale this bunching at longer times is characteristic of any rapidly emitting light source that exhibits blinking to emit single photon on demand pulsed pump laser can be used with its pulse duration shorter than the lifetime of an alternative approach is to apply cw pump laser to the molecule while sinusoidally sweeping an external electric field to shift the molecule absorption line on and off the laser frequency through the stark effect thus periodically modulating the single photon emission the probability of single photon emission approaches unity at high laser intensity when implemented in free space the laser electric field with finite spatial extent may excite more than one molecule and contribute to multiple photon events recent work with single molecule inside high finesse optical cavity shows better controllability of the single photon emission field despite this progress in emission control single molecule can become photo bleached reducing its utility but current advances in material development now allow hours of continuous operation of single molecule under continuous illumination without bleaching this approach needs further improvement for use in practical applications so far single molecule based sources have only demonstrated relatively poor values and photon indistinguishability between photons of the same molecule so it remains to be determined whether improvements can be made and different sources can be controlled so as to yield indistinguishable photons necessary for scalable systems we also note that while room temperature operation is possible tests of indistinguishability were performed at d quantum dots semiconductor quantum dots have been long studied for use as single photon sources they are created with methods such as molecular beam epitaxy where the process of self assembled stranski krastanov growth forms tiny islands of smaller band gap semiconductor embedded in larger band gap semiconductor in addition chemical synthesis can be used to produce colloidal quantum dots for single photon source applications the small size of quantum dots results in discrete energy structure for the electrons and holes in the weak excitation regime an exciton electron hole pair can be produced on demand radiative recombination of the electron hole pair results in single photon emission the radiative lifetime is on the order of ns or less quantum dots can be excited either optically or electrically both optically and electrically excited qds rely on there being single system to limit emission to one photon at time but they do it via different physical paths in the optical case the excitation is created by photon absorption that saturates the single system in the electrical case the excitation is created by directly moving charge carrier or carrier pair onto the qd this can be done through the coulomb blockade effect whereby charges can only move to the qd controllably one at time this has been referred to as an electron or photon turnstile examples of optically active quantum dots include cdse in zns inp in gainp and inas in gaas while an example of an electrically driven quantum dot is inas the emission direction can be engineered by growing distributed bragg reflection dbr mirrors on both sides of the quantum dots quantum dots can also be integrated into micro cavities such as micro pillar disk sphere or photonic crystal cavities when the polarization and energy of the emission field are matched to the cavity the rate of spontaneous emission of quantum dot can be significantly increased due to the purcell effect in addition the well defined cavity mode allows for collection of the emitted single photons into single spatial mode it is important to remember that while the generation quantum efficiency e the probability that an excitation creates single photon can be close to unity the emission efficiency can still be low two electron hole pairs can also be excited to form biexciton state in general biexciton and exciton transitions differ in energy due to the local coulomb interaction but both biexciton and exciton transitions are doublets due to local crystal asymmetry this effect can be used to generate polarization entangled photon pairs quantum dots as single photon emitters need to operate at cryogenic temperatures which is still technically cumbersome in addition the levels achieved are not particularly low in comparison to other single photon emitters due to the fact that qds live in an uncontrolled solid state matrix this along with the fact that each qd is unique structure even though there is progress in tuning them controllably to make them appear indistinguishable significantly dims the potential of practical scalable systems color centers nitrogen vacancy nv color center is formed by substitutional nitrogen atom and vacancy at an adjacent lattice position in diamond the optical transition of nv centers can be modeled by three level energy system with ground state and excited state where is also thermally coupled to metastable state the excited state can decay to the ground state and emit single photon it can also thermally couple to the metastable this state is referred to as shelving state as while in that state the to emission ceases the long lifetime of this shelving state results in decrease in the single photon emission rate and also causes photon bunching when looking at longer times than the color center main transition lifetime when the nitrogen vacancy center is used the emission line is at nm with spectrum broader than nm when another type of diamond lattice defect the nickel nitrogen vacancy center is used the zero phonon emission line is around nm and the spectral bandwidth is few nanometers we note that these are just two of hundreds of such color centers in diamond so it is possible that other suitable defects may be of use in these applications earlier studies with bulk diamond were restricted to low single photon collection efficiency because of diamond high refractive index which leads to small collection solid angle and spatial aberration now the use of diamond nanocrystals with typical subwavelength size of nm ref makes refraction irrelevant it also reduces the collection of scattered background light making the photon antibunching effect more dominant thus much more closely approximating an ideal single photon source similar to single molecule emitters with efficient optical pumping the radiative efficiency of nv center is close to unity at room temperature although some are operated at cryogenic temperatures the lifetime of the excited state is few nanoseconds one important advantage of this implementation is that nv centers are photostable and do not exhibit bleaching or photo blinking nv centers with values less than have been reported disadvantage of nv centers is that they are not identical although some tunability has now been demonstrated via external electric fields there are also efforts to build optical cavities near them improving coupling efficiency and offering potential path to scalability in addition to these single emitter approaches on demand single photon sources have also been realized that use collective excitations in ensembles of atoms these atoms have type energy levels or similar consisting of two metastable ground states and and one excited state as seen in fig all atoms are first optically pumped to for example state then the ensemble is illuminated with weak write laser pulse defined by its frequency and momentum documentclass pt minimal begin document omega vec w end document k which couples to the e transition to induce the emission of photons documentclass pt minimal begin document omega vec s end document k on the g transition with small probability the loose boundary condition allows these raman photons to be spontaneously emitted in multiple spatial modes the successful detection of single raman photon within particular acceptance solid angle projects the whole ensemble into specific single spin wave state documentclass pt minimal begin document vec spin vec w vec s end document spin w s due to energy and momentum conservation the successful detection of two raman photons within the same acceptance solid angle projects the whole ensemble into specific spin wave state with two quanta assuming unit detection efficiency and so on for higher numbers of excitations when the excited atomic ensemble is illuminated by read laser pulse documentclass pt minimal begin document omega vec r end document k which resonantly couples to the e transition the atomic spin wave excitations are mapped onto photon modes documentclass pt minimal begin document omega vec i end document k on the u transition to operate as single photon source pair of acceptance solid angles needs to be carefully chosen to satisfy the momentum conservation documentclass pt minimal begin document vec w vec s vec spin vec r vec i end document w s spin r i the write laser pulse is made weak to reduce the likelihood of creating more than one photon atomic spin wave excitation in the selected mode because detection efficiency is less than unity and typically not photon number resolving the detection cannot distinguish between one and more than one excitation in many experiments the major decoherence mechanism is related to atomic motion e the atoms may move out of the interaction region the typical transverse dimension of the interaction region of laser atomic ensemble in experiments is or the atomic motion perturbs the phase of the excited atomic spin wave which destroys the momentum conservation so even though the photon is stored it will not be retrieved in the anticipated mode the first problem may be overcome by using optical dipole trapping or an optical lattice the second type of dephasing mechanism is reduced by choosing smaller angle with respect to the optical axis of the write and read pulses for collecting the single photons smaller angle corresponds to longer atomic spin wavelength spin kspin that is more resistant to motion induced phase perturbation resulting in longer coherence times which better allows for user defined programmable delays since the first experimental demonstrations of an on demand single photon source based on atomic ensembles of cs and rb seven years ago the demonstrated spin wave coherence time has been extended from few hundred nanoseconds to one millisecond although many applications especially those in the field of quantum information science require an on demand source of single photons and this has led to intense research into developing truly deterministic single photon sources as described in sec ii there is another approach this approach is to generate correlated pairs of photons where the detection of one photon the heralding photon or sometimes referred to as the conditioning photon of the pair heralds the existence of the other photon the heralded single photon typically such heralded single photon sources involve laser excitation of nonlinear optical material although this type of source is not on demand because the pair production is probabilistic process the fact that the photons emitted are heralded is of much use for many quantum information applications because of the statistical nature of the pair production process these heralded sources must be held to average pair production levels much less than one to avoid producing multiple pairs which would result in the heralded channel containing more than one photon if pair is created it will be created at the time of one of the excitation pulses and it will be heralded by the detection of one of the two photons of course losses in the heralded path will result in some heralded photons not being emitted from the source in addition false heralds due to dark counts and stray light will not yield heralded photons and finally losses in the heralding channel will result in unheralded photons being emitted from the source which can be problem in some applications as suggested by klyshko this last issue can be ameliorated somewhat through the use of shutter on the heralded channel that only opens when triggered by herald although initial efforts with photon pair sources employed atomic cascade schemes over the last two decades the most relied on schemes for creating correlated photon pairs have used spontaneous parametric downconversion pdc this pair production process was predicted theoretically by louisell et al in ref and its use as source of nonclassical light was first proposed by zeldovich and klyshko in ref with pair correlations first observed in ref in pdc pump laser illuminates material with optical nonlinearity creating two photons under the constraints of momentum and energy conservation fig the energy and momentum conservation constraints determine the possible wavevector relations between the two down converted photons constraint generally referred to as phase matching for general introduction to pdc see refs this constraint presents both an advantage and limitation it is useful in that the emission from these sources is highly directional which is an advantage in most applications it is drawback in that the inherent dispersion of transparent material is generally not controllable other than the very limited control offered by temperature as result the phase matching constraints often cannot be met for the particular wavelengths of interest this limitation can be surmounted by techniques whereby different refractive indices can be selected or an effective index can be controlled the former relies on polarization birefringence and the latter on waveguide design that impacts propagation velocities in structure there are different types of polarization phase matching possible for parametric downconversion type where the two photons have the same polarization and type ii where the two photons have orthogonal polarization in addition type phase matching with all polarizations aligned is possible in appropriately engineered media there are many properties of the down converted photon pairs that can be correlated including time energy momentum polarization and angular momentum for use in making heralded single photon source the nonlinearity required for parametric downconversion occurs in many different inorganic crystals including for example kd potassium dideuterium phosphate kd po bbo beta barium borate bab linbo lithium niobate and liio lithium iodate materials are typically chosen for the strength of the nonlinearity as well as whether the phase matching constraints can be satisfied for the output and pump wavelengths of interest as mentioned above researchers are also investigating how to engineer crystals with the wavelength and phase matching properties they desire the most promising of these techniques is referred to as periodic poling which involves periodically changing the sign of the crystal nonlinearity to achieve phase matching where it is otherwise impossible thus allowing useful down conversion efficiency this expansion of options benefits other optimizations such as improving the degree of factorability of the states produced that is states without spectral correlation between the signal and idler photons an important characteristic when indistinguishability or entanglement is required for non factorable state detection of the heralding photon collapses the state of the heralded photon in way that can be different from one pair to the next with factorable states the characteristics of the heralded photon are completely independent of the measurement result obtained upon detection of the heralding photon to date many experiments have demonstrated the usefulness of periodic poling with recent source demonstration focused on high degree of factorability in addition to these schemes for developing factorable states as means to improve efficiency and purity in some applications recent result has shown that equivalent results may be achieved by relying on temporally resolving single mode detection rather than direct spectral filtering one disadvantage of based downconversion in crystals is the spatial mode of the photon pairs the photon pairs are typically created in multi mode cones surrounding the pump laser making efficient collection by single mode fibers difficult in part to circumvent this problem recent research has focused on producing correlated photon pairs directly in single mode waveguide this constrains the pairs produced to just single or few spatial modes as well as controlling the phasematching through the impact of the waveguide dimensions on the dispersion and improving the degree of factorability of the resulting states as just discussed four wave mixing nonlinear process in which two pump photons are converted into two correlated photons fig is the dominant nonlinear process in centro symmetric materials such as glass that do not allow nonlinearity even though the absolute nonlinearity of glass is very small optical fiber with its long interaction length can be used to produce photon pairs via fwm to date many experiments have demonstrated generation of correlated photon pairs in single spatial mode using four wave mixing in single mode optical fibers with recent results demonstrating heralded single photon sources using dispersion shifted fiber dsf photonic crystal fiber pcf birefringent single mode fiber bsmf and silicon on insulator soi waveguides one issue with pair sources based on fwm is that raman scattering produces single photon background that must be either suppressed or avoided one disadvantage of heralded single photon sources based on probabilistic correlated photon generation such as the pdc and fwm based sources just discussed is that there exists nonzero probability of generating more than one pair of photons and this multiple pair probability increases together with the probability of generating one pair since typical spads cannot distinguish the detection of one photon from the simultaneous detection of more than one photon multiple pair generation cannot be distinguished from single pair generation as result photon pair sources must be operated so that the probability of generating single pair is low typically in this sense the of these sources inherently degrades as increases other effects such as background scattering only degrade increase the solutions to this scaling problem based on multiplexed photon pair source arrangements have been proposed that allow the single pair emission probability to increase without increasing the multiple pair emission probability and while full experimental realizations of these schemes have not yet been implemented progress is being made we note also that such multiplexed source scheme moves probabilistic heralded source toward more deterministic operation as the single photon emission becomes more frequent photon number resolving detectors see sec iii also help with this multi photon emission problem by allowing the discrimination between single pair and multiple pair emission events another way of dealing with the problem of probabilistic emission in these sources is to couple the heralded source with photon storage mechanism where once heralded photon is stored until needed this moves the probabilistic pair source toward deterministic operation such schemes require efficient coherent exchange of the photon state to the stored state and back and long lived storage in addition the memory storage and retrieval times must be fast enough for practical operation while storage for photons is challenging number of schemes have been proposed and implemented to varying degrees in addition to being used as heralded single photon source correlated photon pair emission whether from parametric downconversion or four wave mixing can also be used for the metrology application of calibrating single photon detectors finally as with pdc there are efforts to create output photon pair states with high degree of factorability by dispersion engineering through the geometry of the fiber other approaches to single photon sources are also being pursued that are at an earlier stage of development than the sources previously discussed examples include sources that use carbon nanotubes quantum interference and two photon absorption hogele et al investigated the photoluminescence of single carbon nanotubes at low temperatures phonon sideband of the nanotube was excited by femtosecond pulsed laser mev above the peak emission energy by directing the photo luminescence to hanbury brown twiss setup the second order correlation function at zero time delay was measured to be at with peak emission wavelength of nm demonstrating that the nanotube only very rarely emits more than one photon upon excitation different approach has been used recently to demonstrate entanglement generation and single photon source based on quantum interference the idea is to interfere weak coherent state with pair of photons produced via parametric downconversion on beamsplitter by properly adjusting the relative phases and amplitudes of the coherent state two photon probability amplitude and the two photon probability amplitude from the downconversion process these two terms can be made to interfere destructively so that the probability of detecting two photons in the output beam is suppressed this essentially creates modified coherent state that ideally has no two photon term the experiments of pittman et al use hanbury brown twiss type setup to demonstrate suppression of the two photon probability by factor of about corresponding to g of finally jacobs et al have proposed scheme for making heralded single photon source using laser pulses and two photon absorption in this scheme two separate laser pulses are each sent into two photon absorbing medium transforming each pulse into field with equal probabilities of having zero or one photon and arbitrarily small multi photon probability these two pulses are then sent to controlled not zeno gate which itself uses two photon absorbing medium the operation of this gate is such that if photon is detected in one of the gate output fields then the other output contains single photon in this way heralded single photon source is produced for this scheme to be demonstrated in the lab suitable two photon absorbing medium must be found single photon characteristics of an ideal single photon we consider an ideal single photon detector to be one for which the detection efficiency the probability that photon incident upon the detector is successfully detected is the dark count rate rate of detector output pulses in the absence of any incident photons is zero the dead time time after photon detection event during which the detector is incapable of detecting photon is zero and the timing jitter variation from event to event in the delay between the input of the optical signal and the output of the electrical signal is zero in addition an ideal single photon detector would have the ability to distinguish the number of photons in an incident pulse referred to as photon number resolution many single photon detectors g single photon avalanche photodiodes photomultiplier tubes pmt superconducting nanowire single photon detectors snspd as typically used are not photon number resolving and can only distinguish between zero photons and more than zero photons deviations from these ideals negatively impact experiments in varying ways depending on the detector characteristic and measurement involved we consider in sec iii the details of various approaches to non photon number resolving single photon detectors including the single photon avalanche photodiode ingaas ge and si quantum dot superconducting nanowire and up conversion detectors in sec iii we consider photon number resolving detectors such as the transition edge sensor tes superconducting tunnel junction stj detector parallel superconducting nanowire single photon detector snspd charge integration photon detector cipd visible light photon counter vlpc quantum dot optically gated field effect transistor qdogfet time multiplexed spad spad array and the recently reported number resolving capability of detector based on single spad the characteristics of examples of many of these detectors are compiled in table ii for ease of comparison there is not always clear distinction between photon number resolving and non photon number resolving detectors as some detectors considered to be non photon number resolving do in fact have some degree of photon number resolving capability and there are ongoing efforts to add or improve number resolving capability to those detectors without it conversely even those detectors classified as photon number resolving do not tell the true number of incident photons if their efficiency is less than unity in addition dark counts add to the discrepancy between the measured result and the true incident photon number section iii discusses unique approaches to single photon detection such as cryogenic thermoelectric detectors qvds proposal for potentially very high efficiency single photon number resolving detector with an atomic vapor absorber and proposal for quantum nondemolition single photon number resolving detector that uses giant kerr nonlinearities almost all single photon detectors involve the conversion of photon into an electrical signal of some sort it is the job of the detector electronics to ensure that each photo generated electrical signal is detected with high efficiency additional electronics is often required after detection to return the detector as quickly as possible back to state that allows it to detect another photon the electronics is often as important as the detector itself in achieving the ideal characteristics outlined above section iii discusses various aspects of detector electronics as mentioned one of the fields currently driving much of the research toward improved single photon detector technology is quantum information science in particular the security and performance of many quantum communication protocols depend strongly on detector properties such as detection efficiency in sec iv we discuss the importance of various source and detector properties to applications in the field of quantum information science non photon number resolving non photon number resolving detectors are the most commonly used single photon detectors while detecting single photon is difficult task discriminating the number of incident photons is even more difficult because the energy of single photon is so small its detection requires very high gain and low noise in many detectors this is achieved by converting the incoming photon into charge carrier and then using high voltage avalanche process to convert that single charge into macroscopic current pulse in the original visible photon counting detector pmt fig photon knocks an electron out of photocathode made of low workfunction material that electron is accelerated to the first dynode where it knocks out more electrons the process repeats as those electrons are accelerated to each subsequent dynode until typically pulse of electrons are generated which can then be detected by ordinary electronics all this requires operation in vacuum while we have put the pmt in the section with non photon number resolving detectors some models have low enough gain noise to make it possible to partially resolve output pulses resulting from different numbers of incoming photons with the first such demonstration made by incorporating first dynode specially prepared to yield higher electron emission we also note that pmt can be used as an photon detector for wavelengths with energies below the bandgap so that more than one photon is needed to generate photoelectron albeit with greatly reduced detection efficiency and requiring tightly focused beams to enhance the multi photon absorption process the efficiency of pmts is typically in the range of to limited by the efficiency with which the incoming photon knocks out the initial photoelectron from the photosensitive surface the photocathode while these efficiencies are impressive for pioneering technology they fall short of the requirements of many modern applications other features of pmts are the large sensitive areas documentclass pt minimal begin document textrm cm end document cm or even up to documentclass pt minimal begin document textrm end document fast response low timing jitter and low dead time with the capability to resolve photons separated by nanosecond and the low level of dark counts output pulses that result from causes other than incident photons the dark count rates can be as low as few events per second particularly if the pmt is cooled by few tens of degrees their major drawbacks include their reliance on vacuum tube technology which limits their lifetime reliability and scalability single photon the spad fig uses similar process to the pmt but the initial photon absorption creates an electron hole pair and the charge multiplication is continuous with voltage applied across semiconductor lattice rather than between discrete dynodes suspended in vacuum spads are typically run in what is referred to as geiger mode where bias voltage greater than the diode breakdown voltage is applied thus when charge is generated by an incoming photon the charge multiplication or avalanche proceeds until it saturates at current typically limited by an external circuit and that current is self sustaining the saturated avalanche current must be terminated by lowering the bias voltage below the breakdown voltage before the spad can respond to subsequent incoming optical pulse this saturation means that gain in geiger mode is not useful concept geiger mode spads can have detection efficiencies higher than pmts up to for si spads in the visible although spad dark count rates and timing jitter are somewhat higher than the best pmts and for ir spads efficiencies are in the to range with dark count rates much higher than pmts to reduce dark count rates spads are typically cooled with thermoelectric coolers to temperatures of to in addition the spad gain medium typically has trap sites that must be allowed time to depopulate after an avalanche has occurred and before the bias voltage can be restored if those sites are not allowed to depopulate second avalanche can be initiated by carriers released from traps rather than from new photon this afterpulsing effect necessitates additional waiting time after pulse before rebiasing the device as result spad dead times can range from tens of nanoseconds to this is particular problem for spads designed for ir sensitivity there are number of schemes focused on these issues to reduce dead time or its effect to reduce afterpulsing g by detection multiplexing to maximize the time recovery between firings of single detector and by self differencing of adjacent pulses to reduce avalanche currents and output transients relative to the avalanche signal of interest to improve ir performance and to realize some photon number resolution capability efforts toward photon number resolution are discussed in sec iii some design techniques can result in very low time jitter detectors these usually involve thinner absorption regions so there can be tradeoff between detection efficiency and timing jitter although there is an effort to regain some efficiency by using cavity enhancement around the thinner absorber an in depth look at the details of this type of tradeoff can be found in ref and commercial example of this tradeoff can be seen in ref while all commercial spads operate in geiger mode there are efforts to develop linear mode operation for photon counting this would have the advantages of having an output that is proportional to the number of incident photons yielding photon number resolution lower afterpulsing due to lower current flow and less trap filling and reduced dead time the smaller current pulses generated in the linear mode require long measurement times to reduce the readout noise and thus in one recent demonstration detection efficiency and dark count rate was achieved but at khz maximum repetition rate while these linear devices can in principle provide photon number resolution the noise on the gain and the smaller signals involved can broaden the output current pulse amplitudes so much that pulses due to different numbers of incident photons cannot be resolved we are unaware of any demonstrated number resolution of these devices having just described pmt and spad detectors we note that there is detector that is essentially hybrid between the two it consists of photocathode and electron impact multiplication stage in vacuum providing gain followed by an avalanche diode multiplication region for total gain above this arrangement allows for photocathode optimized for particularly difficult wavelength for photon counting detectors nm with efficiency of and low dark count rate of counts quantum dot field effect transistor based quantum dot in conjunction with field effect transistor fet has been reported to offer single photon sensitivity in the near ir this detector design sometimes referred to as qdogfet consists of an optical absorber with thin layer of quantum dots between the gate electrode and conduction channel in an fet the photo generated charges move to the quantum dots where they are trapped those trapped charges shield the gate potential and thus modify the channel conductance of the fet in one implementation the trapped carriers are holes that reduce the negative field of the quantum dots allowing the conductivity to increase thus current can flow unimpeded until the photon generated carrier is removed or recombines yielding an observable single photon signal we also note detector that operates on the same scheme as the qdogfet but instead uses native traps rather than quantum dots to store the photo generated charges another quantum dot based approach uses the photo generated carriers to enhance resonant tunneling through double barrier by adjusting the field so that the well between the two barriers matches the energy of the band on the other side of one of the barriers the tunneling rate increases dramatically and in proportion to the number of incident photons in this scheme the photo generated holes trapped by the quantum dots provide the field necessary to shift that intermediate band into resonance we note detector that works on similar principle but because it operates in the far ir it is beyond the scope of this review superconducting nanowire single photon this fast timing jitter ps single photon detector relies on narrow superconducting wire that is biased with current at level just below the critical current density above which the wire must revert to normal resistance fig in this state when an incoming photon is absorbed its energy causes small spot of the wire to go normal this in turn causes the current to flow around the normal resistance region and as result the current density is increased in those adjacent regions those adjacent regions now exceed the critical current density and normal resistance region is formed all the way across the width of the wire this small normal region of the superconducting wire yields voltage spike that indicates the detection of single photon because this detection mechanism requires very narrow wire nm meandering surface filling arrangement of the wire is used to create practical sensitive area in addition devices fabricated with mirror on top of the nanowire meander made of nbn thus forming an optical cavity have achieved detection efficiencies in the neighborhood of in these devices the light first passes through the nbn substrate subject to reflective losses subsequent devices have achieved efficiencies not including light missing the detector active area of and at nm and nm respectively by adding an antireflection coating to the input side of the cavity device these detectors do not suffer afterpulsing although they can latch into mode where they stay in the normal state due to self heating of the normal region and have to be actively reset by reducing the current flow because these detectors require superconductivity their operating temperatures are typically in the range of or less while the arrangement just described cannot discriminate between one or more incident photons as we shall see in sec there are efforts to provide this detector with some photon number resolving capability up conversion single photon up conversion of photon from the infrared where detector characteristics are typically poor to the visible spectral region where detector performance is better has been demonstrated by number of research groups and has been commercialized the scheme uses sum frequency generation in nonlinear crystal where strong pump beam mixes with the ir single photon of interest to create single photon at the sum frequency in the visible both visible spads and pmts have been used for the detection of the up converted photon the key drivers for these efforts are better detection efficiency at low dark count rates and higher count rates with better pulse pair resolution the overall efficiency of this approach is the product of the optical conversion efficiency the optical losses throughout the system and the visible detector efficiency the up conversion step has been demonstrated with near unit efficiency with the other factors limiting the overall efficiency to to to date background count rates are also of concern as the up conversion process can produce significant number of unwanted photons to address this having the up conversion pump photon at an energy lower than the ir photon to be up converted rather than the other way around may prove advantageous in some applications this avoids having the pump beam create raman photons at the wavelength of interest that are then up converted as if they were incident ir photons photon number resolving developing photon number resolving pnr detectors is important for many applications in quantum information science such as quantum computation using linear optics and quantum communication section iv describes how photon number resolution impacts quantum communication protocols one direct approach to gaining photon number resolving capability is to simply break the detector active area into many distinct areas or pixels so that each can register photon independent of the others and when they do only the pixel or pixels that detected photon suffers dead time and recovery time thus we have multiple pixel device where each pixel cannot resolve photon number but taken together they can resolve as many photons as there are separate pixels if those photons happen to hit different pixels for small numbers of pixels requiring the photons to hit different pixels can be an issue but as the number of pixels increase the probability of hitting the same pixel with another photon decreases resulting in much more faithful approximation to true photon number resolving capability before describing specific pnr detectors we should clarify what is meant by photon number resolution it is important to lay out the degrees of photon number resolution that detector can have first we note that as mentioned earlier photon number resolving does not mean that one determines the number of photons incident on the the detector without detection efficiency the measured number is at best just lower estimate and with dark counts it is not even that this is particularly an issue for detectors with very low efficiency in addition we attempt to categorize the degree of pnr capability into three groups defined as no pnr capability for devices that are typically operated as photon or no photon device some pnr capability for devices made of multiple detectors that individually have no pnr capability and thus are limited in the maximum photon number that can be resolved to the number of individual detectors and full pnr capability for devices whose output is inherently proportional to the number of photons even if their detection efficiency is low and their proportional response ultimately saturates at high input photons levels we are assuming relatively narrow band light incident on these detectors so that detector with an output proportional to the incident energy is used to provide information on photon number rather than the energy of those photons while this categorization is somewhat arbitrary it is of some use in understanding the types of mechanisms used to produce pnr capability superconducting tunnel junction stj based one of the first superconducting photon number resolving detectors was the superconducting tunnel junction detector in it photons are absorbed in thin superconducting layer the absorbed energy results in many broken cooper pairs quasiparticles because the photon energy is times the energy needed to break cooper pairs that superconducting layer is separated from second superconducting layer by an insulator that is thin enough nm to allow significant tunneling of the quasiparticles small bias voltage across this superconducting tunnel junction results in current flow that is proportional to the photo generated quasiparticles small magnetic field parallel to the barrier along with bias voltage that is low enough prevents unbroken cooper pairs from tunneling across the junction as the device is operated significantly times below the superconducting critical temperature there are many fewer thermally generated quasiparticles than photo generated quasiparticles so single photon detection is possible because the current produced by this device is proportional to the incoming photon energy it can resolve photon number it has been demonstrated for wavelengths between nm to nm limited on the long wavelength end by its energy resolution nm at wavelength of nm devices have been demonstrated with detection efficiencies of as estimated by reflectance and transmittance calculations at counts rates of khz at an operating temperature of background count rates are very low of photo generated counts and mostly limited by electronic noise although thermal blackbody photons may also contribute quantum dot field effect transistor based the qdogfet detector as discussed earlier uses photo generated charges to modulate electrical conductance and that modulation is proportional to those charges thus this device has pnr capability and has been demonstrated with detection efficiency of at nm this implementation was shown to distinguish and greater than photons with the percent of correct assignments for these four bins being and respectively as shown in table ii the qdogfet has low detection efficiency with repetition rate of khz and very low dark count probability of gate the quantum dot detector based on modulation of resonant tunneling through barrier also has been demonstrated to have range of few photons of pnr capability with detection efficiency of at nm with and dark count rate of ref another implementation of this scheme showed linear operation which indicates the potential for pnr operation the dark count rate can be improved by an order of magnitude at cost of reducing the detection efficiency to the operating temperature of this detector is although faster operation was obtained at superconducting nanowire based single photon in sec we discussed the principle behind superconducting nanowire single photon detectors two schemes have recently built upon that principle to demonstrate devices with some photon number resolving capability both achieve this by using several distinct nanowires to fill the active area rather than just single nanowire the first of these schemes the parallel snspd uses nanowires connected electrically in parallel the currents through the parallel wires are summed so that the single analog output signal is proportional to the number of wires that have gone normal due to incident photons this arrangement offers the potential of even faster operation speed than the already fast single snspd because the inductance of the individual wires is much lower than the longer single wire meander of the original snspd whose temporal response is inductance limited this scheme was demonstrated with niobium nitride nbn nanowires nm wide with capability of counting up to four photons dark count rate of hz and repetition rate of mhz while the parallel snspd performs well relative to other photon number resolving detectors in regards to dark count rate and repetition rate as shown in table ii most other detectors outperform the parallel snspd detection efficiency of at nm the second scheme also runs parallel wires but does so as completely separate detectors with individual outputs thus the result is digital output e the number of output pulses gives the number of photons detected this scheme was demonstrated in system of four separate wires with reported system detection efficiency of superconducting transition edge the superconducting transition edge sensor operates as bolometer that is electromagnetic radiation is absorbed and then that absorbed energy is detected as rise in temperature to achieve the extreme sensitivity required to detect the energy of single photon the heat capacity of the absorber must be made extremely small and the thermal sensor must exhibit large response to small temperature change as thermal device which measures energy absorbed its output is proportional to the number of photons absorbed thus it can provide photon number resolution the extreme temperature sensitivity is achieved by constructing the thermal sensor from thin layer of superconducting material deposited on an insulating substrate made to operate at temperature in its transition between superconducting and normal resistance so slight change in temperature yields large change in resistance the device is maintained at this temperature through negative electro thermal feedback this works by applying constant voltage bias across the film which increases the temperature of the electrons in the sensor film above the temperature of the substrate when photon is absorbed the temperature of the sensor rises which increases its resistance which in turn reduces the current flowing through the sensor and thus reduces the joule heating of the device thus the constant voltage bias and this electro thermal feedback work to maintain the sensor at set temperature within its superconducting transition temperature region and the signal due to photon is seen in reduction in the current flowing through the sensor further sensitivity is achieved by measuring that current change using superconducting quantum interference device squid array the heat capacity of the sensor is reduced by fiber coupling the light to the device by placing the fiber end just few tens of from the sensor the sensor can be made small typically across in addition operating at the low temperatures required for the superconducting transition operation further lowers the heat capacity note that the relevant heat capacity is that of the electrons in the superconductor and it is important that the thermal link between these electrons and the phonons in the substrate is low which is the case at the temperatures of these devices typically mk this weak thermal coupling of the electrons to phonons provides link to thermal heat sink that allows the electrons to slowly cool after quickly heating up upon photon absorption since single photon sensitivity was first demonstrated in the visible and ir tes devices of high efficiency have been demonstrated with superconductors made of tungsten titanium and hafnium and because they rely on simple absorption of the incident radiation followed by conversion to heat their wavelength sensitivity can be tailored by appropriate antireflection coatings on the sensor surface and most recently these devices have been fabricated using design that self aligns the fiber to the sensor area facilitating reliable and robust high efficiency assembly and construction important steps toward scalable detector from table ii we also see that the highest detection efficiency among pnr detectors is achieved by the transition edge sensor tes detectors with detection efficiency of for an incident wavelength of nm and to at nm we also note that these detectors provide some of the best visibility between photon number resolved peaks of any visible detector despite these high detection efficiencies and very low dark count rates drawbacks generally include slow response of ns and low maximum counting rates of khz although ref reports maximum count rates up to mhz and the need to operate at temperatures less than mk visible light photon as seen in table ii another detector that achieves quantum efficiencies almost as high as the tes is the visible light photon counter with detection efficiency of up to at nm photon incident onto vlpc detector will first encounter an intrinsic silicon layer followed by gain layer that is lightly doped with arsenic see fig and fig of ref an incident photon can be absorbed either in the intrinsic silicon layer or the doped gain layer creating an electron hole pair bias voltage of to accelerates the electron hole away from toward the gain region the gain region containing the as impurities lies mev below the conduction band holes that are accelerated in the gain region impact ionize these impurities exciting donor electrons into the conduction band these scattered electrons create further impact ionization events resulting in avalanche multiplication assuming single photon absorption event always creates an electrical signal of the same magnitude then the output electrical signal should simply be proportional to the number of detected photons in practice however detectors that rely on multiplication gain have excess noise referred to as gain noise due to the fact that single photon absorption does not always produce an electrical signal of the same size if the multiplication noise is too large as it is for spads for example then photon number resolution is very difficult or impossible the vlpc however demonstrates nearly noise free multiplication the first reason is that due to the partial overlap of energy states of adjacent as impurities holes left behind in the impurity state after impact ionization travel very slowly via conduction hopping preventing the holes from producing further impact ionization events single carrier multiplication in this case only the electrons are multiplied has been shown to result in lower multiplication noise the second reason for the low multiplication noise is that low electric fields are required because the as impurities are only mev below the conduction band this results in little variation in the time between ionization events which has also been shown to reduce multiplication noise this low multiplication noise is what allows for demonstrated photon number resolving capability of the vlpc of photon numbers up to six the probability of error in making the decision increases from for zero photons to for six photons the number resolution of the vlpc is due to the fact that the charge multiplication resulting from an incident photon is localized to spot few microns across so only that region suffers dead time the rest of the detector typically mm in diameter remains ready to register additional photons with the output signal being the sum of those output pulses with this localized dead region being such small fraction of the total detector area the number resolved operation can be nearly complete but one must be aware of this mechanism and avoid focusing the light too tightly on the detector or number resolution will be limited while the efficiency and photon number resolution of the vlpc are impressive the repetition rate khz is low and the dark count rate khz is high very similar in design to the vlpc is the solid state photomultiplier sspm which has very broad spectral sensitivity ranging from nm to the width of this range while quite remarkable has the drawback that it requires additional effort to shield the detector from any of the long wave ir photons that might be out of the wavelength band of interest in addition the availability of these detectors is very limited other photon number resolving other approaches to pnr detectors that we do not have the space to discuss in detail include the spad array simply achieving photon number resolution by having the optical mode impinge upon an array of parallel spads that are read out individually or summed to give single output pulse with amplitude proportional to photon number the time multiplexed spad refs and this uses essentially the same idea as the spatial spad array but splits up the mode into many temporal modes rather than many spatial modes detailed performance analysis can be found in ref and the charge integration photon detector cipd ref an ingaas pin photodiode connected to the gate of gaas junction gate field effect transistor the performance of these approaches relative to other pnr detectors can been seen in table ii one recent approach uses single spad as photon number resolving detector by measuring the slope of the avalanche rise before saturation to discern information about the number of incident photons this is done in conjunction with self differencing circuit that greatly reduces the size of the capacitive transient of the apd which allows lower overbias voltages and lower thresholds to be used it is reported that the combination of these advantages provides photon number resolution for up to four photons at wavelength of nm detection efficiency of repetition rate of mhz and dark count rate of less than per gate unique approaches to single photon other approaches to single photon detection that are less well known than the approaches discussed in secs iii iii include qvds proposal for high efficiency pnr detector using an atomic vapor absorber and proposal for quantum nondemolition qnd single photon number resolving detector that uses giant kerr nonlinearities qvds are based on heat to voltage conversion and digital readout and rely on the thermoelectric effect that occurs when junction between dissimilar materials is heated although theoretical analysis claims that such detectors offer the potential to count at rates of mhz photon counting in the visible using this method has yet to be demonstrated it has been proposed that an atomic vapor with three level system plus an additional level can be used as the basis of high efficiency pnr detector the scheme relies on the three level system plus an escort pulse to allow an incoming photon to transfer one atom to metastable level where second laser can cycle the atom many times in closed two level system with the scattered photons being the indicator that photon has been absorbed the reliance on an atomic vapor absorber offers the potential for high absorption efficiency and the cycling transition allows for many scattered photons for each atom transferred which means high detection efficiency can be achieved and because there would be direct correspondence between the number of incident photons absorbed and the number of atoms undergoing the closed cycling transition this scheme would be photon number resolving quantum nondemolition qnd measurement is one where the state is determined but is not destroyed in the measurement so that the now known state remains available for other uses such measurement for photon number state was proposed by imoto et al and discussed later in detail by others the principle is to co propagate the weak signal light pulse whose number of photons is yet to be determined with an stronger light pulse in highly nonlinear medium the intensity of the signal pulse changes the refractive index of the medium which can then be seen as phase change in the stronger copropagating light pulse the key difficulty is that for the unknown few photon state to produce resolvable phase change in the copropagating pulse the medium must have very large optical nonlinearity the photonic interactions such as kerr nonlinearity or cross phase modulation for most media typically do not have large enough nonlinear coefficients while generally far from implementation because of this difficulty possible candidate media for the qnd detection can be optical fiber high quality factor cavity and electromagnetically induced transparency eit in an atomic ensemble recently pryde et al reported qnd measurement on the polarization state of single photons it was pointed out and clarified that such measurement on the polarization state is distinct from qnd measurement of photon number electronics for single photon as we have seen single photon detectors use range of physical effects to detect photon however there is an important trend most detectors work close to critical regime so that single photon changes the regime of operation in the case of avalanche photodiodes the n junction is reverse biased with voltage that is somewhat higher than the breakdown voltage so any single free carrier inside that n junction can start an avalanche in superconducting nanowire detector the wire is biased with current just below the level that would drive the wire normal the electronics in these devices is used to set correct bias voltages or currents to monitor sudden changes of detector properties due to photoelectronic detection and to return the device to its normal regime in what follows we discuss electronics design efforts specific to avalanche photodiodes as that has been an area of significant effort and detection improvements geiger mode avalanche photodiode operates reverse biased at voltage that is above the breakdown voltage vb single free carrier generated via photoelectronic process injected into the depletion layer triggers self sustaining avalanche the current rise time is usually less than ns this current continues to flow until the bias voltage is dropped this process referred to as quenching is main cause of dead time because the detector cannot respond to incoming photons until the quenching is completed and the bias voltage is restored once the bias voltage is restored the device is then ready to detect another photon the operation just described requires special circuit that does the following detects the leading edge of the current pulse that corresponds to an avalanche generates an output pulse exhibiting minimal jitter with respect to the avalanche pulse lowers the bias to quench the avalanche and restores the photodiode voltage to the operating level vb if detector is gated then the circuit must apply reverse bias to the detector in synchronization with the incoming optical pulses and discriminate between pulses due to bias voltage transients and actual avalanche current in addition to the above operations given the numerous tasks required of the detector electronics the features of the circuit dramatically affect the operating conditions of the detector and as consequence the detector overall performance the quenching mechanisms can be of three types passive quenching or active quenching circuits or combination of the two in passive systems the avalanche current quenches itself this approach is implemented with very simple circuit the photodiode is biased through resistor that is small compared with the diode resistance when no avalanche is present and large compared with the diode residual resistance during avalanche process typically documentclass pt minimal begin document textrm omega end document to documentclass pt minimal begin document textrm omega end document when an avalanche occurs the high avalanche current flowing through the bias resistor results in voltage drop across that resistor reducing the voltage across the diode to close enough to the diode breakdown voltage that statistical fluctuations in the current can cause the avalanche to stop once the avalanche current has stopped the voltage across the diode rises again to its initial bias level and is ready for the next photon the avalanche is detected by standard comparator this arrangement was employed in the early experiments with avalanche diodes in geiger mode pulses detected in this way have very sharp front and an exponential tail that corresponds to reverse bias voltage recovery this process typically takes few microseconds during the recovery process the detector regains the ability to detect single photons but because the excess voltage has not yet reached its normal value its detection efficiency varies in time also if second photon arrives during the recovery time the comparator can miss it because its threshold might be higher than the recovering voltage across the n junction even if the detection electronics does detect photon during the recovery time the time between absorbing photon and issuing an electronic pulse will differ from that of an isolated photodetection increasing overall timing jitter under these conditions an accurate photon count requires the use of low light levels to guarantee small probability that second photon is absorbed by the detector during its recovery time unfortunately correcting count losses due to such recovery time by applying correction protocols originally developed for nuclear detectors leads to inaccuracies this is because those detector systems have different dead time characteristics either their dead time is unaffected by what happens during that dead period or there is mechanism where events occurring during the dead period such as the receipt of an additional photon causes that dead period to be extended there have been many attempts to improve single photon detectors based on passive quenching it has been shown that photon timing accuracy can be improved somewhat if very low electronic level threshold is used however lowering the threshold can result in false detections as noise can trigger the circuit another idea to improve detection timing jitter is by using constant fraction trigger circuit instead of simple threshold trigger unfortunately this approach is only partially effective because the very shape of the avalanche signal depends on the reverse bias voltage therefore during the dead time recovery transient when the reverse bias voltage is rising the rise time of the avalanche changes the lower the bias voltage the longer the rise time we see that despite the apparent simplicity of the detector electronics the practical use of passive quenching limits sometimes significantly detector performance also attempts to improve the photon counting rate require more complex electronics an approach that defeats the advantages of simple circuit another passively quenched spad scheme has recently been developed and has demonstrated some improvements this scheme integrates the load resistor monolithically with the spad which greatly reduces the device capacitance and the time for the passive quenching to occur this in turn reduces the total flow of charge through the spad which results in lower afterpulse probabilities this scheme with the load resistor integrated with the spad has been referred to as negative feedback avalanche diode nfad to distinguish it from spad with hybrid passive quench circuitry in addition because of the compact design nfad arrays can be implemented where the detectors are in parallel and the output pulse amplitude provides some photon number resolution as each nfad can fire and recover independently nfads have been implemented with inp diodes with efficiencies of to at and pulse durations of ns to ns and maximum count rates could extend as high as mhz similar to the nfad array design which offers the potential of number resolution through discrete devices continuous version has been demonstrated in an ingaas avalanche diode using self quenching and recovery in localized region thus an absorbed photon leaves the rest of the detector area able to respond to another incoming photon with the output being the sum of all the individual avalanches the basic idea behind active quenching is to detect the rise of an avalanche pulse and control the reverse bias voltage accordingly that is upon detection of the rise of the avalanche pulse by comparator the bias voltage source quickly lowers the reverse bias to below the breakdown voltage documentclass pt minimal begin document textrm end document vb after some hold off time defined by the lifetime of free and trapped carriers in the avalanche region the bias voltage is restored the main advantages of active quenching are the fast switching from geiger mode to quenched mode and the well defined avalanche and reduced dead time the idea is fairly simple but there are many design issues to consider also even though the timing jitter is significantly reduced some transient effects that impact timing and detector sensitivity remain the first actively quenched circuit was reported in few years later in its ability to reduce detection timing jitter was demonstrated and the fast gating of photodiode was attempted modern actively quenched detectors can have electronic photodetection jitter below ps and dead times below ns the dead time is currently limited by carrier trapping time inside the avalanche zone of the photodiode and not by the quenching electronics however transient effects can still complicate the behavior of detectors immediately before and immediately after the quenching pulse contributing to so called twilight effects for detectors with high dark count rates gated operation is necessary there are two types of gated circuits the simplest has fixed time for the apd bias to be applied in this case if an avalanche occurs it is quenched at the predetermined end of the gate time the alternative uses an active circuit that terminates the bias as soon as an avalanche is detected after the gate is turned on this has the advantage of reducing the total charge flow through the apd which reduces the number of trapped carriers and as result the rate of afterpulsing this scheme has become more practical as integrated quenching electronics has been developed both gating schemes rely on switching the bias voltage from vb to vb and back these rapid voltage changes cause the diode to act like damped capacitor when no avalanche occurs because of these large background pulses it can be hard to pick out the avalanche signal unless efforts are made to cancel the transient voltages or gate times are made long enough that the transients can be temporally discriminated by the electronics there are several strategies to deal with these transients an intuitive approach is to send the gate pulse to both the photodiode and capacitor resistor pair that mimics the transient in p junction with no avalanches the same result can be achieved using distributed impedances that create two identical but temporally displaced output pulses then one pulse is simply subtracted from the other before being sent to comparator if no avalanche is present the transient effects cancel if an avalanche is present it will be easily revealed however such matching requires careful study of the photodiode properties under the operating conditions bias voltage temperature etc and adjustment if either the photodiode or its operating conditions change there are other schemes for canceling these transients it has been proposed that two rather than one avalanche photodiodes are used with their outputs arranged to cancel transients from one another however the two detectors must be nearly identical one can overcome this requirement by using two subsequent pulses from the same apd with one pulse delayed in time to overlap the other in this case no prior information about the photodiode is needed but there is problem if adjacent pulses each have an incident photon only the first one will be detected by the electronics as the second one will be canceled by the first resulting in undercounting also if the gating must be synchronized to clock random gating necessary for cw heralded photon detection cannot be used there is another proposal where the output of the detector is passed through an integrator in that case the passive response of the photodiode is removed by integration while the avalanche will appear as an offset due to an extra avalanche peak the problem here is that an avalanche is detected only after the gate ends which erases information as to when within the gate pulse the avalanche occurred another related approach to dealing with transients works in somewhat inverse fashion in this scheme discriminator threshold is set to sense the negative going transient at the end of the gate pulse this transient is due to the capacitance of the detector discharging when an photon triggers an avalanche that avalanche discharges the detector capacitance so the negative going pulse is reduced and is not seen by the comparator thus the absence of the comparator firing indicates the detection of photon this has the advantage of suppressing afterpulsing by allowing for shorter gate duration and thus fewer filled trap sites finally there is scheme aimed at reducing afterpulsing in ingaas spads by reducing current flow in an unusual manner the scheme uses the fact that while an incoming ir photon triggers an avalanche that avalanche itself results in the emission of other photons that may be visible si spad registers these secondary photons so effectively the system works by up conversion from the ir to the visible the advantage in afterpulsing is gained because the ir spad does not need any processing electronics for its avalanche greatly reducing its total capacitance this greatly reduces the charge through the diode resulting in fewer filled traps that must be emptied while just proposal calculations suggest high detection efficiency and low afterpulse probabilities are possible detailed review on the history of detector electronics can be found in refs and modern trends in developing electronics for spads that require gating are found in ref single photon sources and detectors are key to photon based quantum communication we use this area as case study of how the real characteristics of sources and detectors impact performance in practice in particular we look at qkd and quantum repeaters and how the nonideal natures of single photon sources and detectors directly affect the communication rates the link lengths and the security to illustrate the effect that source and detector properties may have on qkd protocols we consider the example of the bennett and brassard qkd protocol of bb protocol which uses polarization encoding while decoy state methods using faint laser pulses may reduce the need for single photon source development for qkd the characteristics of single photon detectors will still greatly influence the practically achievable performance of qkd protocols in general and we note that specific security attack schemes have focused on particular detector characteristics additionally the development of quantum repeaters key enabling technology for long distance quantum communication will depend critically on the performance of both single photon sources and single photon detectors we first consider bb qkd protocol whereby common set of random bits are generated at two ends of communication link for later use as secret key in sending encrypted messages it is important to note that although we assume that the photon polarization is used to encode the qubit in this example polarization is just one of many possible ways to encode qubits in photons for example time bin qubits are preferred at telecom wavelengths in the bb polarization encoded scheme the sender alice encodes random zeros or ones in the polarization state of single photon the encoding is done by randomly setting the photon polarization to either horizontal or vertical to represent or or by setting the polarization to diagonal or anti diagonal to represent or the receiver bob randomly selects either the hv or da bases to analyze the polarization of the photons he receives by an open authenticated communication channel alice and bob reconcile the preparation and measurement of each bit so that they know which photons made it through the optical link and were detected by bob and which of these were analyzed in the basis that matched the sending basis they discard any bit that either was not received by bob or was analyzed in the wrong basis leaving what is referred to as sifted key this open reconciliation channel contains only the basis and which photons were received not the measurement result so an eavesdropper eve of this open channel would not learn if the bit was or only by intercepting and receiving the photon pulse would eve have chance to learn the value of the bit sent but because only single photon was sent after making her measurement eve would have to prepare new photon to send to bob but because eve would not know if the sending basis was hv or da she would send the photon in the wrong basis of the time that would mean that some of the time that alice sent in particular basis bob would receive in that same basis and vice versa this telltale error can be detected by alice and bob by comparing subset of their common bits and additional measures would have to be taken to maintain security those additional measures consume some of the sifted key bits but create shorter secret key that greatly reduces the amount of knowledge that eve can have of the resulting secret key shared by alice and bob while acknowledging that the subsequently developed decoy state scheme has provided way to address this issue the qkd just described assumes the bit to be transmitted is single photon for if the photon pulse encoding the bit contained more than one photon then eve could potentially detect just one photon while letting the other continue unperturbed to bob who would not detect eve presence because no error was created while faint laser pulse sources were the easiest and first sources used for qkd implementations two single emitter systems namely quantum dots and nitrogen vacancy centers have been used as single photon sources in proof of principle qkd experiments in principle for given secure communication rate single emitter based qkd systems can achieve longer key transmission distances than faint laser pulse systems this is because the nonzero two photon emission probability decreases the performance of faint laser systems relative to the performance of single emitter systems due to the increasing loss with increasing distance with faint laser systems that have loss between the source and detector there is always some probability that the detection of single photon corresponds to the emission or two or more photons with the other photon being lost in transmission this issue is avoided by operating the source such that the probability of single photon emission is much less than one so that the probability of emitting two or more photons is negligible operating at lower mean photon number means that bob will record zero photon time bins more often thus decreasing the bit rate in addition since bob must look at more time bins to obtain the same number of useful events the contribution of noise dark counts and stray photons in bob detectors increases this is an example of nonideal characteristic of photon counting detector that will result in greater bit error rate yielding shorter secret key for given length of sifted key in contrast the emission rate of single emitter sources does not need to be operated with since by definition there is zero probability of two photon emission or zero to significant degree in implemented systems the result is that the secure communication rate of single emitter qkd systems relative to faint laser pulse systems increases with increasing loss another way of saying this is that since loss increases with distance single emitter based qkd systems can achieve longer transmission distances than faint laser pulse systems for given secure communication rate to date however technical challenges have limited single emitter qkd demonstrations to relatively modest distances in addition to source issues the nonideal nature of the photon counting detectors used in qkd system also affects its performance as we have already discussed how detector dark counts impact qkd system we move on to discuss the effect of detector efficiency which has the same impact as link loss it means that for given rate of photons incident on the detector bob will detect zero photons more often thus decreasing the bit rate this will also increase the contribution of noise in bob detectors resulting in greater bit error rate and yielding shorter secret key for given length of sifted key the result is that the secure communication rate of detector increases with increasing efficiency other detector properties such as detector dead time also affect the performance of qkd protocols if the dead time of detector is greater than the smallest possible time bin spacing allowed by the single photon source then increased dead time results in decreased communication rate it has also been shown that detector dead time can lead to the leaking of information or even be directly manipulated by third party to gain information from the quantum channel in addition to these properties it has been shown that even small differences in detector timing jitter can leak secret key information from these protocols to enable quantum communication for networks over long distances quantum repeaters will be essential quantum repeaters work by breaking the total communication distance into series of shorter links with quantum memories being required to create entanglement between the end nodes of each link at least one quantum repeater protocol has been developed that relies only on single photon sources as compared to source of correlated pairs of excitations and single photon detectors and whose fundamental fidelity would be theoretically equal to one for perfect sources detectors and other components as with qkd protocols the performance of quantum repeater protocols depends on the characteristics of the sources and detectors used in practice for example for the quantum repeater protocol described in ref detector dark counts and multiple photon emission can correspond to states other than the desired entangled state decreasing the fidelity as an example for the parameters listed in ref communication length of km characteristic absorption length in the fiber of km corresponding to the telecommunications wavelength of memory efficiency of detector efficiency of and single photon emission success probability of the detector dark count probability of each detector must be smaller than and the two photon emission probability for each source must be smaller than for final fidelity of in summary the non ideal nature of both single photon sources and single photon detectors can greatly affect quantum communication protocols the sources by not being truly on demand reduce throughput limit link length and can compromise security and by not being reproducible and indistinguishable single photon states quantum communication systems will suffer reduced overall efficiency that will ultimately make scalable system unachievable as with nonideal sources photon counting detectors with nonideal characteristics like finite detection efficiency non number resolving non zero timing jitter finite dead time etc have similar impacts on practical quantum communication systems in addition because detectors convert the quantum state to classical information they are also subject to direct attacks on security that cannot rely on fundamental principles like quantum mechanics to be detected as should be clear by now the field of single photon sources and detectors is of great interest and importance to many applications and the importance of these applications is driving many current efforts to improve these devices the field has now reached certain level of maturity with devices finding their way into many off the shelf components today it is possible to find nearly ideal devices when only one parameter is important but performance of other parameters is often compromised examples of such trade offs for sources is low versus the deterministic character of photon emission and for detectors an example is the efficiency versus speed trade off seen in the tes detector much of the current work in this field involves studying and addressing such trade offs specifically for sources while initial efforts were focused mostly on increasing brightness and generation efficiency current improvement efforts are more driven by the requirements for particular applications and often deal directly with improving more than one characteristic simultaneously as it is now well understood that heroic results in improving single parameter are often of little practical use these present multi parameter efforts include better single photon state accuracy in the form of lower and higher degrees of indistinguishability of single photon output states which is particularly important for many quantum information applications these improvements involve engineering of photon state parameters such as designing sources to produce uncorrelated joint spectral distributions e factorable states another example of state engineering is the multiplexed pdc source which is an attempt to increase single photon emission efficiency and reduce multi photon emission or equivalently reduce simultaneously there are also significant efforts toward scalable devices with more compact and robust designs which are also critical to the ultimate development of any large scale photonic systems that might be required for information processing metrologic sources or even complicated quantum measurement arrangements this focus on scalability is one of the drivers that has moved source efforts from bulk pdc to fiber fwm now to isolated quantum systems particularly at room temperature and silicon photonic waveguides for detectors while it is clear that spads are the workhorse devices for great many applications there are needs for detectors that exceed what is available with spads for individual properties as result there is much work to improve detectors with improvement directions including higher efficiencies with some already approaching lower timing jitter with sub ps demonstrated reduced afterpulsing and better photon number resolution as with sources there are also efforts toward improving more than one detector parameter simultaneously such as giving the high speed snspd detectors some photon number resolution by implementing multiple element detectors or switched multiplexed detectors that reduce dead time and afterpulsing effects simultaneously or ir upconversion schemes that have high efficiency high count rates and low background rates one can certainly expect these trends toward improving multiple parameters for both sources and detectors to continue for the foreseeable future as there is plenty of room for improvement and there are many applications that can benefit from such improvements all this effort on single photon devices requires supporting efforts in single photon metrology with an ultimate goal of connecting photon counting radiometry to conventional detector and source standards that typically deal with too many photons to even consider counting while this is certainly an ambitious goal it offers potential path toward improving radiometric measurements by many orders of magnitude and provides solid infrastructure for characterizing and developing better sources and detectors  during the past decade the application of ambient pressure photoemission spectroscopy appes has been recognized as an important in situ tool to study environmental and materials science energy related science and many other fields several appes endstations are currently under planning or development at the usa and international light sources which will lead to rapid expansion of this technique the present work describes the design and performance of new appes instrument at the advanced light source beamline at lawrence berkeley national laboratory this new instrument scienta hipp is result of collaboration between advanced light source and its industrial partner vg scienta the hipp provides superior electron transmission as well as spectromicroscopy modes with spatial resolution in one dimension and angle resolved modes with simulated

the advancement of pes to function at higher pressure while such systems have been developed for the past years there has been resurgence of ambient pressure pes appes in the past decade due to advanced construction of electron analyzers and the exploitation of synchrotron facilities with high brightness tunable monochromatic light with small spot size the first synchrotron based appes system to employ an electrostatically controlled and differentially pumped prelens system an active appes lens system was built at the advanced light source als bending magnet beamline after this proof of concept system was built two additional second generation systems were constructed jointly at als ref and die berliner elektronen speicherring gesellschaft r synchrotronstrahlung these second generation systems provided increased photoelectron pe transmission and utilized undulator beamlines advances in many fields including the investigation of catalyst properties in relevant reaction

microscopy and angle resolved pes arpes matured and become powerful tools in materials science and solid state physics over the same period ray pe microscopy which can be achieved either by focusing the ray beam or imaging pes with dispersive electron lens system providing spatial mapping of elemental composition and chemical states arpes has become an essential tool for electronic structure determination in modern condensed matter physics it helped physicists especially in the field of high temperature superconductors to map band structures which is the basis for understanding electron transport and surface reactivity with similar rich phases and sensitive temperature dependence catalysis is another example of complex phenomena in solids that can be explored using arpes we report on the design and construction of new appes system with high electron transmission and detection efficiency to reduce radiation exposure and data acquisition time additionally one dimensional imaging spectromicroscopy and angular modes have been developed and tested these additional features increase our ability to extract more information from detected pes and study more complex materials under catalytically and environmentally relevant conditions merging the rich landscape of pe microscopy and arpes with the in situ capabilities of appes will lead to deeper understanding of materials under working conditions which is necessary for the rational design of advanced materials with tailored properties this new system will be an important tool for the discovery and testing of new materials in energy related research there are numerous design criteria for an appes system in addition to those for pes under ultrahigh vacuum uhv conditions first the uhv environment of the ray source must be separated from the elevated pressure of the analysis chamber this is typically accomplished by the use of thin silicon nitride or aluminum window second the analysis chamber must be separated from the electron detector which operates in high vacuum this is accomplished by differential pumping through series of apertures the radius of the aperture between the analysis chamber and the first pumping section fig in large part defines the ultimate pressure limit of the system typically mm determines the gas conductance from the analysis chamber into the analyzer lens column and also sets the minimum distance between the sample and aperture and therefore pe transmission through the gas see sec iii this minimum distance determines the upper limit of workable pressure damage of samples resulting from irradiation must be considered for pes and related spectromicroscopy techniques decomposition of organic materials reduction of oxides and charging of insulators and semiconductors lead to unwanted artifacts appes introduces additional challenges when samples are analyzed in reactive gas environments gas molecules and or adsorbates are ionized by pes and secondary electrons inducing unwanted reactions and leading to surface modification additionally appes experiments require higher ray doses because of gas phase pe scattering so that optimized pe transmission is of even greater importance maximum pe transmission has been the major design criterion of this endstation the hipp system is based on scienta with two dimensional detector consisting of two multichannel plates mcps

stainless steel chamber extends from the fourth pumping stage to the port connecting the main chamber with the preparation chamber to enhance the energy and spatial angular resolution the system has metal shielding from the analysis chamber to the entrance of the hemispherical analyzer to reduce the effects of external magnetic fields the individual metal sections are interconnected to form closed shield the shielding in the main chamber was au coated to protect the ni rich alloy from corrosion by reactive gases the first aperture is at the front end of removable au coated ti cone with radius of mm the size of the first aperture is compromise between maximizing counts at low pressure larger radius and increasing the maximum pressure of the system smaller radius to match the spot size of beamline relatively large aperture size was selected the typical ray spot size at beamline is mm mm spreading out much further because of the incident angle as the ray spot size decreases with improved beamline refocusing optics the aperture radius can be decreased thereby increasing the pressure without sacrificing counts the main chamber is equipped with four axis motor system for

focused infrared laser to reduce background reactions during catalytic studies the system resides at bending magnet beamline at the als this beamline delivers soft ray light in the range ev the beamline which must be maintained under uhv to avoid contamination of optical elements is separated from the main chamber by mm mm nm thick si window at distance cm from the sample usual operation of the storage ring at ma and beamline exit slit at delivers flux of photons at ev using l mm grating l mm grating provides light peaked at ev the energy resolution of the beamline is about e for the preparation cleaning and study of well defined samples including single crystals and thin films preparation chamber has been built which includes ion sputtering phi leed vg microtech rvl and thermal evaporator additionally there are many ports on the preparation chamber that can be equipped with user provided uhv equipment the pumping system of the appes endstation was designed to optimize the pe count rate while also providing the highest possible maximum pressure at the sample and low pressure mbar at the detector the system consists of five pumping systems separated by apertures and isolated using metallic ring seals the electron focusing of the spectrometer is accomplished by using the scienta spectrometer lenses as well as additional lens elements in prelens system see sec ii using the current setup the prelens has working distance of mm maximum transmission mode and focuses the pes onto the focal plane of the the additional lens elements are controlled by the analyzer electronics and have been integrated into the lens tables of the different lens tables have been developed to provide either the largest energy range highest transmission optimal spatial resolution or angular resolution see secs iii iii the first priority has been to develop system for optimized pe transmission when the probed sample surface is at high pressure the prelens geometry should therefore be able to reduce the pressure over very short distance while collecting large fraction of the pes noteworthy is that the optimal solution has to take into account the size of the excitation spot and the multidimensional geometry of the gas flow it is also important to design stable operating conditions create flexibility in lens mode operation maintain excellent energy resolution and allow for the light beam to have an unimpeded path to the sample the vision has been to design system that is very flexible gives high experimental throughput and maximum uptime we built and empirically tested the differential pumping performance of number of simplified models of prelenses using these models we have also been able to study the breakdown voltage for different pressures and gases in addition gas dynamic simulations based on monte carlo methods have been used to visualize the performance of the differential pumping system these calculations have proven invaluable in guiding the prelens design in fig we present gas dynamic simulation of the prelens geometry to facilitate the calculations we adopted rotationally symmetric equivalent of the actual prelens geometry the first aperture has radius of mm and the pressure behind the sample has been set to mbar which is higher than recommended for this aperture size sec iii some additional boundary conditions associated with the differential pumping have been set from empirical results we found that prelens geometry with relatively large acceptance angle allows for attractive gas flow and optical properties on the low pressure side of the first aperture the gas can significantly expand in the radial direction resulting in steep pressure gradient of the gas expansion zone in the direction along the optical axis fig an open first cone also allows for the possibility to put second conical lens element very close to the first aperture there are several benefits of putting lens element very close to the first aperture first it allows the electron optics to control the trajectories very early in the path making it possible to keep the trajectories close to the optical axis second very efficient differential pumping stage is obtained which implies that most of the gas load is directed toward the first pump third this differential pumping stage has high pe transmission without requiring node of the electron trajectories because of the spherical aberrations inherent in electrostatic lens systems good point to point imaging is limited to relatively small angular intervals furthermore electrostatic lens systems inherently have strong chromatic aberrations the position of node will therefore be function of the kinetic energy this is especially important to consider when optimizing for high transmission with large pass energy when two dimensional detector simultaneously collects over large energy interval the second differential pumping stage comprises additional lens elements and ends with an exit slit the size of this slit is matched to the hemispherical analyzer entrance slit the position of the exit slit is in the standard sample position of the lens using matched exit slit gives sufficient differential pumping properties at this stage without reducing the electron throughput most importantly the use of an exit slit provides the dynamical freedom necessary to operate complex lens modes stably and continuously over large energy ranges the prelens moves the effective source point of the lens mm further from the analyzer and matches the size and angular divergence of the beam to the analyzer acceptance properties in typical operation magnified image of the sample spot is created on the exit slit magnifications ranging from two to six times have been used for different situations the imaging properties of the prelens are best for magnification of around five times in the current design setup the sample first aperture and exit slit of the prelens are all at ground potential so that the prelens does not change the energy of the pes according to liouville theorem the product of the spatial and angular lens magnifications is then unity the lens will therefore receive pes where the angular distribution has been compressed into range that is well adapted to its normal operation parameters for optimal transmission the lens can be set to very efficiently focus such distribution on the entrance slit of the hemispherical analyzer using lens tables similar to those developed for large spots since the prelens can control the electron trajectories at such an early stage very large angular range can be transformed into well collimated beam through the exit slit of the prelens fig dependent of the chosen slit size and energy resolution virtually all electrons that pass through the exit slit of the prelens will reach the detector for kinetic energies below ev and for spot sizes similar to the radius of the first aperture the total transmission under uhv conditions of the system is not much different from that of normal lens to calculate lens tables for more complex situations the complete lens system must be treated by the optimization routines both imaging mode with good linearity and constant magnification and angular mode with constant dispersion and good linearity of the dispersion have been calculated to work over large energy ranges the differential pumping system for the new appes endstation is different from the first prototype system and qualitatively similar to those used in the second generation systems the front aperture and first pumping stage were specifically designed to achieve the ideal gas pressure profile predicted by molecular flow through an aperture specifically ti cone with half angle fig and thin aperture edge causes rapid expansion of the gas after crossing the aperture plane this profile has been modeled for mbar gas at sample surface mm from the first aperture with mm fig the differential pumping system of the scienta hipp was tested with s turbomolecular pumps on each of the first three pumping stages since testing l turbomolecular pump was added to the fourth stage the pressure was monitored in the first three pumping stages and near the detector while was dosed into the analysis chamber when the pressure was mbar in the analysis chamber mbar the first and second stage pressures measured near the pump inlets were mbar and mbar respectively the pressure at the analyzer was mbar pressure drop of between the main chamber and the analyzer is sufficient for pressures up to few mbar using the nomenclature of ogletree et al the maximum pressure for an appes system is when the effective path length for pes through pressure pmax is twice the electron mean free path kt pmax where t and are the boltzmann constant temperature and the electron cross section which depends on the identity of the gas and the pe kinetic energy respectively under these conditions the measured intensity is roughly of the intensity measured in vacuum while this value is arbitrary it serves as good comparison between systems to ensure that the gas pressure at the sample is at least of the sample must be at distance greater than twice the first aperture radius r at this minimum distance one obtains the expression pmax kt e for ev pes through oxygen gas at room temperature pmax mbar when mm when the system is used for spatial resolution see sec iii the optimum working distance is mm which reduces the effective pmax to mbar at working distance of mm the effect of pressure on the pe count rate was determined by monitoring the au peak intensity of an au thin film at incident photon energy ev in an oxygen atmosphere over range of pressures fig a fit of the data toln i deff ep kt where cm for oxygen at ev ke implies deff mm fig this value can be compared with the effective path length under conditions of molecular flow for whichdeff p dx z where is in units of at working distance of mm r deff ideal mm which is within the uncertainty of the experimentally determined value of deff one of the motivating factors for designing new appes system to replace the old appes endstation at beamline was to dramatically increase the transmission and detection efficiency of pes not only does improved transmission and detection decrease data acquisition times it also alleviates problems associated with beam damage by decreasing the radiation exposure of sample to achieve the same counting statistics additionally faster acquisition time leads to improved temporal resolution for time resolved studies pe spectra of ar were recorded at pressure of mbar ar with mev steps and ms dwell time three scans using the high transmission mode with the new scienta hipp is compared with an average of ten identical scans recorded with the old endstation at beamline ref in fig pass energy was set to achieve similar resolution clearly there is significant improvement in detection efficiency and therefore counting statistics providing faster acquisition times and decreased beam damage even with only of the counting time the signal to noise is significantly improved we estimate that the transmission of the hipp endstation is well over an order of magnitude better than previously obtainable for even faster acquisition times the ccd detection can be utilized to record spectra in fixed mode rather than sweeping through an energy range using dispersive hemispherical analyzer with two mcps and ccd camera detector system it is possible to record data in two dimensions one of which represents the energy and the other may represent either spatial distribution or take off angle within the field of view electron counts can be averaged over suitable energy range while spatial or angular resolution can be obtained in the slit direction depending on the lens table used for the spectrometer electrostatic lenses lens tables were developed in order to optimize the spatial resolution of the spectrometer and were tested by measuring sample consisting of m au line that was beam deposited onto thermally grown sio on si wafer fig oriented such that the au line was perpendicular to the slit in this orientation the au photoemission lines appear only within narrow range of the camera image fig first the magnification was experimentally determined by shifting the sample parallel to the slit with calibrated step motor and recording the center of the au peak on the ccd camera fig one camera pixel corresponds to depending on the exact distance between the sample and first aperture this agrees well with the calculated magnification of after determining the magnification at each working distance the spatial resolution of the spectrometer as function of working distance fig and kinetic energy was determined the best resolution achieved is the investigation of the spatial resolution was undertaken at ev pass energy the magnification and resolution of the electron lens system are determined by the electron lens table spatial resolution not being primary design requirement of the prelens system it is difficult to achieve good spatial resolution with short working distance the original calculation of the optimal resolution lens table led to working distance of mm however this distance is too far for the ray beam to reach the sample with the small si window and the beam is cut off second such long working distance will greatly reduce the electron transmission when operating at elevated pressure we found good imaging capabilities at working distance of mm through our experiments with the gold bar samples the best resolution of was obtained at this distance inset of fig at photon energy of ev ev ke the spatial resolution of the system depends on the retardation ratio and was determined to be and at kinetic energy of and ev respectively we believe it is possible to improve the performance of this imaging mode by improving both the ray spot size and the electron lens table we are currently working to obtain shorter working distance larger magnification and smaller aberration it seems that smaller aperture size is needed for any significant improvement similarly it was challenge to obtain lens table for arpes through novel design of the prelens system and the combination of numerical simulations and experimental testing of the electron lens table the resulting ap arpes capabilities are promising due to the lack of azimuthal rotational freedom of our manipulator we performed the first ap arpes experiment on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite hopg it has been demonstrated on azimuthally disordered hopg graphite that sharp quasiparticle dispersions along the radial direction can coexist with complete lack of dispersion along the azimuthal direction arpes data were collected using the wide angular mode with acceptance angle of and theoretical angular resolution of the sample used was grade zya hopg obtained commercially from structure probe inc the hopg sample was cleaved in air and transferred to the load lock the sample was then transferred into the high pressure chamber under uhv figure shows an uhv arpes intensity map taken at ev photon energy as function of binding energy and angle in plane momentum corresponding to momentum cut along random azimuthal direction through the point on the fermi intensity map due to the azimuthal disorder of hopg the fermi intensity map has perfect circular pattern we can clearly see well defined dispersions in excellent agreement with data collected using the scienta at the same photon energy except with higher background intensity this is mainly due to the large photon spot size mm and possible surface contamination from cleavage in air upon sample rotation in the theta direction all the features in the intensity map shifted accordingly as expected this demonstrates the linearity of the lens table over large acceptance angle of comparison of figs and in fig we show the same arpes intensity map in an atmosphere of mbar co gas although there is an increase in background noise the energy dispersion of hopg is still clearly observed direct comparison between figs and shows no appreciable pressure dependence of the hopg dispersion three nondispersive features appear at and ev referenced to the fermi level due to and pes from gas phase co the fact that we can perform arpes at mbar pressures on an azimuthally disordered system is significant advancement in appes this development will open new research playgrounds and will allow us to reveal the electronic structure changes of solids during solid gas interactions such studies can provide unprecedented insight in many important fields such as heterogeneous catalysis and corrosion the measured electronic structure of model catalysts under reaction condition can be directly compared with theoretical calculations new appes endstation has been designed and built for beamline of the als the mission of beamline is to provide state of the art in situ characterization for catalysis and materials science using ray photoemission which will be greatly served by this new endstation this new endstation provides manyfold increase in pe transmission and therefore signal to noise ratio and decreased acquisition time additionally we also developed an imaging mode and an angle resolved mode by recording spatial and angular information we can obtain extra information from each collected pe spatial resolution of provides the ability to study structured materials with junctions on the scale of tens to hundreds of microns such as batteries solid oxide electrochemical cells gas sensors etc angle resolved appes opens the possibility of directly mapping the electronic structure of catalysts under relevant operating conditions with many additional appes systems in development or being planned at synchrotron facilities around the world this technique is poised to reveal new insights into the structure of catalysts the mechanisms of corrosion and many other important industrial and environmental processes  this review summarizes recent studies of thermal transport in nanoscaled semiconductors different from bulk materials new physics and novel thermal properties arise in low dimensional nanostructures such as the abnormal heat conduction the size dependence of thermal conductivity phonon boundary edge scatterings it is also demonstrated that phonons transport super diffusively in low dimensional structures in other words fourier law is not applicable based on manipulating phonons we also discuss envisioned applications of nanostructures in broad area ranging from thermoelectrics heat dissipation to phononic devices in the past two decades rapid developments in synthesis and processing of nanoscale materials have created great demand for understanding of thermal transport in low dimensional nanomaterials nanostructures include one dimensional structures like nanotubes nts and nanowires nws two dimensional crystal lattice with only one atom thick planar sheets like graphenes and thin films consisting of alternating layers of two different materials superlattices to improve the speed of processors the size of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors mosfets has been scaled down to gate length of nm and much smaller in the future high intensity mosfets may induce more hot spots so that the heat removal in microelectronics is burning issue that limits the performance and reliability nanostructures with high thermal conductivity can be applied in heat dissipation to speed up applications of nanostructure in thermal management comprehensive investigation combining theoretical modeling computational simulation and experimental studies is indispensable in addition to great interests in applications there is also demand for the understanding of heat conduction in low dimensional systems the conduction of heat is one of the most important fundamental physical phenomena in nature traditionally heat flux through homogeneous material is believed to follow the fourier law which states that heat flux is proportional to temperature gradient along the path of heat flow as t where is thermal conductivity for bulk material the thermal conductivity is believed to be an intensive property which should be independent on the size and geometry just as other material properties such as density specific heat and electrical conductivity fourier law has been confirmed in last two hundred years in bulk materials three dimensional macroscopic systems however in the last few decades it was found that the fourier law was violated in low dimensional lattices it was found that thermal conductivity of fermi pasta ulam fpu like chains diverged with the system size as the reported value of varies from to there is still an outstanding debate on universal exponent value of wang and li found that equals at intermediate coupling and equals at low temperature and weak coupling in lattice they also suggest that is when there is coupling between longitudinal and transverse modes thus nano materials are very promising platforms to verify the fundamental thermal transport theory in low dimensional systems in recent years some theories have been developed to describe the heat transport in nanomaterials various simulation approaches such as molecular dynamics md monte carlo mc lattice dynamics ld non equilibrium green function negf boltzmann transport equation bte etc have been used in investigating nanoscale thermal transport furthermore as advances in micro and nano technology more and more experimental measurements of thermal properties of nanomaterials have been reported the combination of theoretical simulating and experimental investigations will definitely expedite our understanding of heat conduction in nanoscale in this article we give detailed discussion on present understanding of thermal transport in nanostructures in sec ii we show new physics and some novel thermal properties in and nanostructures including size effect boundary edge scatterings and phonon coherent resonance effect sec iii introduces the experimental works on nanotubes nanowires and graphenes we also discuss the applications of nanostructures in thermal management phononic devices and thermoelectrics in sec iv at the end we give conclusions and outlook in sec due to the length limit we only address some important fundamental issues here specially works from china for comprehensive reviews on thermal properties of nanomaterials please also refer to refs and fundamentals of thermal transport in carbon nanotubes cnt are one of the promising nanoscale materials discovered in the they have many exceptional physical and chemical properties from about ten years after it was discovered the thermal property of nanotubes came to the spotlight of research and attracted worldwide research interests kim et al observed the conductivity of multi wall carbon nanotubes mwcns is more than m at room temperature the ultra high thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes is from the pure honeycomb structure isotope doping is an efficient way to reduce the thermal conductivity the isotope effects on thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes have been investigated by md simulations and it is found that the thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes can be reduced more than with isotope impurity later this large reduction by isotopic doping effect has been confirmed experimentally zhang and li calculated the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity of single wall carbon nanotubes swcnts fig shows the length dependent thermal conductivity of swcnt at and respectively it is clear that thermal conductivity diverges with nanotube length as and decreases from to as temperature increases from to at high temperature the transverse vibrations are much larger than that at low temperature thus interaction between the transverse modes and longitudinal modes becomes stronger which leads to smaller value of the similar length dependent thermal conductivity is also observed in swcnts this length dependent thermal conductivity was experimentally verified by chang et al in multi wall carbon nanotubes with varies from to at room temperature these results demonstrate anomalous heat conduction in nanotubes to understand the mechanism of the length dependent thermal conductivity the heat diffusion in swcnt was studied quantitatively the width of the energy pulse can be measured by its second moment sigma sum limits e t vec i vec i rm sum limits e t t ei e i r i ei e where ei is the energy of atom at time vec i r t is the position of atom at time and vec i i is the position of energy pulse at the averaged energy profile spreads as in figs and we show versus time in logarithmic logarithmic scale so that the slope of the curve gives the value of it is clearly seen that at energy transport ballistically in swcnt whereas at energy transport super diffusively with this is slower than ballistic transport but faster than normal diffusion at low temperature the vibrations of atoms are very small the potential can be approximated by harmonic one thus phonons transport ballistically in swcnt however at room temperature the anharmonic terms appear due to excitation of the transverse vibrational mode the situation changes dramatically in li and wang proposed quantitative connection between heat conduction and diffusion by using the fractional derivative they derived relationship between and as which establish connection between the microscopic process and the macroscopic heat conduction they stated that an anomalous diffusion indicates an anomalous heat conduction which corresponds to divergent thermal conductivity if we use for swcnt then which is in good agreement with the direct md simulation the anomalous heat diffusion is responsible to the length dependent thermal conductivity in addition to cnts silicon nanowires sinws have attracted great attention in recent years because of their excellent physical and chemical properties and their potential applications in many areas including biosensor electronic device and solar photovoltaics sinws are appealing choice due to their ideal interface compatibility with conventional si based devices because of boundary scatterings from high surface to volume ratio and confinements on number of phonon modes volz and chen predicted that thermal conductivity of sinw is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of bulk si which is confirmed experimentally by li et al later in monte carlo method is developed to simulate phonon transport in nws which is in good agreement with the experimental data the reduction in thermal conductivity was attributed to the phonon group velocity reduction and the phonon lifetime reduction due to strong phonon phonon scattering moreover because of the large surface to volume ratio the boundary scattering in quasi structure is also significant it was demonstrated that the disordered surfaces and decreased lifetimes of propagating modes are responsible for the reduction of thermal conductivity in sinws the impacts of size cross section interface defect and surface adsorption on thermal conductivity of nanowire have been studied by using equilibrium and non equilibrium md simulation schelling et al reported the finite size effect on thermal conductivity of sinws they showed that the results obtained by the equilibrium and non equilibrium methods were in reasonable agreement with experimental results of sinws later liang and li derived an analytical formula of diameter dependent thermal conductivity of nws where the surface scattering and the size confinement effects of phonon transport are considered the thermal conductivity predicted by their analytical formula were in good agreement with experimental data for sinws gaas nws and thin films in yang zhang and li demonstrated the length dependent thermal conductivity and the anomalous heat diffusion in sinw by using non equilibrium md as shown in fig the thermal conductivity increases with nw length up to and the length dependence of thermal conductivity is different in two length regimes at room temperature when length is less than about nm the thermal conductivity increases with the length linearly for the longer wire the diverged exponent reduces to in addition the diverged exponent also depends on temperature at is only about when nm this critical length nm is in good agreement with previous predicted value of mean free path in bulk si when sinw length is less than the phonon mean free path the phonon phonon interaction can be neglected then the phonons transport ballistically like in lattice of harmonic oscillators and the thermal conductivity increases with the length linearly when the length of sinw is much longer than mean free path the phonon phonon scattering plays key role in the process of phonon transport different from bulk material phonon phonon interaction alone is not sufficient to reach diffusive process in sinw that is the phonons transport super diffusively which results in diverged thermal conductivity the results demonstrate that the sinw is promising platform to verify phonon transport mechanisms in low dimensional systems the numerical results demonstrate heat conduction of sinw does not obey fourier law even though the nw length reach micro scale and the super diffusion is responsible for the length dependent thermal conductivity fourier law has received great success in describing macroscopic heat transport the belief is for certain material with definite composition and structure the thermal conductivity is an intensive property that should be independent on the geometry and size just as other intrinsic properties such as density specific heat and electric conductivity this characteristic has been confirmed by two hundred years of experimental observations however rigorous proof for fourier law in micro nano scopic hamiltonian dynamics is still lacking it is still an open and debated question whether fourier law is valid in low dimensional systems from the length dependent thermal conductivity it is concluded that thermal conduction is anomalous in nano materials this anomalous phenomenon has been referred by some people as breakdown of fourier law in literature for nanomaterials the natural defects and isotopic doping in the process of fabrication affect the thermal transport properties lot doping with isotopes atoms increases phonon scattering thus results in reduction of thermal conductivity in yang zhang and li investigated the isotopic effect on thermal conductivity of sinws as shown in fig the thermal conductivity of sinws can be reduced exponentially by random isotopic doping and reach minimum value doped as about of that in pure si nw the heavier isotope atoms can decrease conductivity much more than the lighter ones more interesting the thermal conductivity of isotopic superlattice structured sinws depends obviously on the period of superlattice as shown in fig the superlattice structure can reduce the conductivity significantly because the mismatch in power spectra of isotropic atoms with different mass at critical period of nm the thermal conductivity is only of the value of pure sinws more interestingly the thermal conductivity increases anomalously when the superlattice period length is smaller than this critical value this anomalous increase in thermal conductivity was explained by the collective vibrations of different mass layers in superlattice structured sinws when superlattice period is smaller than this critical value the similar periodic length dependent thermal conductivity was also observed in kr ar superlattice nws in addition to the random and interface scatterings of phonon the surface scattering is another way to reduce thermal conductivity it has been demonstrated that thermal conductivity of nws can be reduced further obviously by introducing more surface scattering making sinws hollow to create inner surface e silicon nanotubes sints fig shows the room temperature thermal conductivity of sinws and sints versus cross section area even with very small hole only reduction in cross section area induces the reduction of thermal conductivity of moreover with increasing size of the hole linear dependence of thermal conductivity on cross section area is observed the reduction of thermal conductivity can be understood from the analysis of phonon participation ratio ratio fig there is reduction of ratio in sints for both low and high frequency phonons compared with sinws for those localized modes with ratio less than it is clear that the intensity of localized modes is almost zero in the centre of nw while with finite value at the boundary fig this demonstrates that the localization modes in sinws are distributed on the boundary especially at the corner of cross section plane in addition due to inner surface introduced in sints energy localization also shows up around the hollow region see fig most of the above approaches to reduce thermal conductivity such as introduction of rough surface and defect scatterings are based mainly on incoherent mechanisms which cause phonons to lose coherence in the following we discuss how to use the phonon coherent resonance to tune thermal conductivity the coherence of phonons in ge si core shell nws sinws and sints can be quantitatively described by the heat current autocorrelation function hcacf for both sinws and sints there is very rapid decay of hcacf at the beginning followed by long time tail with much slower decay to zero the long tail of hcacf reveals that this nontrivial oscillation is not random but shows periodic manner as is shown in fig the resonant amplitude first increases to peak value and then decreases as size of core increasing interestingly the resonant amplitude at different temperature shows the same structure dependence to understand the mechanism fig shows the fast fourier transform fft of normalized hcacf for core shell nws which are very similar to the spectrum of the coherent resonance effect of in confined structure atoms near the core shell interface are stretched due to the different sound velocity which induces strong coupling between the longitudinal and transverse modes this coupling is weakened in pure sinws due to the same sound velocity of atoms this coupling picture gives explanation to the coherent resonance effect in the transverse direction can indeed manifest itself in hcacf along the longitudinal direction in core shell nws moreover when longitudinal phonons transport along core shell nws their energy are dispersed to the transverse direction due to the coherent resonance and mode coupling very recently the direct connection between coherent resonance and thermal conductivity reduction was reported in ge si core shell figs and compares the ratio for eigen modes in pristine genws ge si core shell nws with perfect interface and ge si core shell nws with rough interface there is reduction of ratio in low frequency regime for coated nw which is caused by the resonance induced by coupling between the transverse and longitudinal modes as the strongest resonance peak is related to the eigen mode with lowest frequency in transverse direction the localization is remarkable for phonons with long wavelength nw diameter the ratio in core shell nws shows an overall reduction for very low frequency longitudinal acoustic la phonons fig an obvious dip of the ratio is observed at around thz which is consistent with the resonance frequency found in fft of hcacf along the longitudinal direction and thus provides the strong evidence that phonon resonance in core shell nws leads to localization for low frequency phonons more importantly core shell induces localization for low frequency phonons while interface roughness localizes the high frequency phonons fig when the coating thickness is less than certain critical value thermal conductivity of ge si core shell nws is smaller than that of pristine genw fig thus the core shell structure offers the unique opportunity to further reduce thermal conductivity of low thermal conductivity material even by coating with high thermal conductivity material this offers novel avenues for the design and thermal management in nanostructures experimentally the reduction in thermal conductivity in core shell nw has been verified in addition to the one dimensional nanomaterials graphenes and narrow graphene nanoribbon gnr have attracted immense interests recently mostly because of their exciting physical properties caused from the unusual one atom thick structure superior thermal conductivity as high as m has been observed in graphene which has raised the exciting prospect of using them for thermal management devices there are rich physical phenomena about thermal property of gnrs the effects of size defects doping shape stress strain substrates inter layer interactions nanoscale junctions chirality topological structure edge effect foldings gradfolds etc on thermal conductivity of nanoribbons have been widely studied due to different boundary condition intrinsic anisotropy thermal conductivity of gnr is reported as shown in fig the room temperature thermal conductance of zigzag gnr is about thirty percent larger than that of armchiar gnr this anisotropy phenomenon will disappear when the width is larger than nm for both armchair and zigzag gnr its thermal conductivity depends on the width as shown in fig the thermal conductivity of zigzag gnr increases firstly and then turns to decrease with the width increasing while the armchair gnr thermal conductivity monotonously increases with the width increasing which comes from the competition between the edge localized phonon effect and phonons umklapp effect an interesting resonant splitting of phonon transport in periodic shaped gnr fig was observed by using negf method these resonant peaks are originated from high quasi bound states in which phonons are mainly localized in the constrictions and temperature dependent thermal conductivity fig of single layer and multi layer gnrs are also investigated by using md simulations zhai and jin investigated the strain effect on ballistic thermal transport in gnr by combination of negf and the elastic theory at temperature below the thermal conductance increases observably for gnr with stretching strain of and due to lot of dispersive phonon modes are converged to the low frequency region it should be noted the structure become unstable when strain increases from to however at high temperature the strain effect is totally different the room temperature thermal conductivity of gnrs decreases up to under tensile strain due to the softening of the phonon modes the edge modes play an important role in thermal conductivity of gnr jiang and wang predicted that there exist phonon localized edge modes in square lattice and graphene when two conditions are satisfied simultaneously couplings between different directions in the interaction ii different boundary condition in three directions as shown in figs and by applying the open boundary condition in the and periodic boundary condition in directions both conditions and ii are satisfied and there is localized edge modes in figs and the condition ii is broken by applying open boundary condition in both and directions now there are only extended modes in this system no localized edge mode as combination of stress strain inter layer and substrate effect the folded gnr gives rise to more interesting physics because of their fascinating electrostatic and electronic properties the folded gnr is also good candidate and promising way for future phonon engineering in graphene derivatives in yang et al have investigated thermal transport in folded gnrs systematically using md ld and negf method as shown in fig the percentage of reduction is dependent on the number of folds moreover the more the structure with folds is compressed the more the thermal conductivity is reduced the thermal conductivity of gnr with folds can be substantially decreased up to compared to the flat gnr the transmission spectra show the decrease of thermal conductivity comes from strong scattering of low frequency modes at the folds figs and which is much different from other high frequency phonon scatterings by impurities dislocation and boundaries in addition compressing the interlamellar space provide more number of phonon states available for three phonon scatterings the results suggest that besides geometries sizes and other modulation methods the method of folding provides additional freedom of manipulation transport properties in graphene which may further strengthen its position as mainstream building block in future device fabrication the achievements of modern nano fabrication technology have enabled us to measure thermal properties of nanomaterials although still with great challenges thermal conductivity of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts bundles was firstly measured to have relatively low values probably due to the dominant scatterings in the barriers between tubes in order to reduce the inter tube scatterings and to study the intrinsic thermal conductivity of individual mwcnt kim et al adopted the thermal bridge method by integrating complex electron beam lithography and nano manipulation suspended microelectromechanical system mems device was used to measure the thermal conductivity of mwcnt unlike the traditional method using bundle of mwcnts in the form of rod or filament an individual mwcnt was measured as shown in fig upper insert rh and rs are pt loop on top of suspended sinx membranes joule heat is created by applying electrical current in rh which will dissipate through both the three supporting sinx beams and the mwcnt creating temperature raise in rs under steady state thermal conductivity of interested sample can be calculated by measuring the temperature raises in rh and rs the observed thermal conductivity is more than m in mwcnt with diameter of nm which is two orders of magnitude higher than that in mwcnts bundles following the microfabricated structures mentioned above significant progress has been made in investigating the thermal conductivity in various one dimensional structures such as sinws cnts and boron nitride nanotubes zno nws vo nanobeams etc very recently chen et al developed this technique with dramatic improved sensitivity resulting in the capability to verify the theoretically predicted phonon coherent resonance effect in ge si core shell ultrathin nws the development of suspended microfabricated structures for thermal properties measurement has paved the way for many significant studies in understanding the fundamental thermal transport at nanoscale recently by taking advantage of their advances in nanofabrication li and thong managed to fabricate the mems in the size of inches with more than devices integrated in one single wafer insert in fig based on this technology systematic study of the thermal conductivity of individual single crystal zno nws with diameters ranging from nm to nm was performed by li and thong groups the thermal conductivity of zno nws is found to be significantly reduced when comparing to that in bulk materials due to the enhanced phonon boundary scatterings an empirical relationship for diameter dependent thermal conductivity was demonstrated which shows an approximately linear dependence of thermal conductivity with cross section area fig this diameter dependence is expected to stimulate further theoretical investigations of the intrinsic effect of size on the thermal transport in nws understanding thermal transport in nanomaterials more specifically the interaction between nanostructrues are of intriguing interests for developing thermal management and thermal conversion applications recently thermal conductivity of double boron nanoribbons coupled with van der waals interaction was found to be significantly higher than that of free standing individual nanoribbons fig this observation indicates that significant portion of phonons transport the interface of the two boron nanoribbons without being scattered in additional yang et al also found double nanoribbons prepared in ipa solution has relative lower thermal conductivity than that of an individual nanoribbon fig the authors then wetted the same double nanoribbons in reagent alcohol and di water mixture and found that the thermal conductivity increased by this enhancement could be eliminated by wetting the nanoribbons again in ipa fig this provides simple approach to tune thermal conductivity of bundle nanomaterials coupled with van de waals interface despite the significant progresses and successes in measuring thermal conductivity of nanomaterials using the suspended mems there are still many challenges the primary challenge lies in the difficulties in measuring the thermal contact resistance at the two ends of sample which would have major contribution to the total measured thermal resistance to this end yang et al carried out systematical measurement on length dependent thermal resistance in mwcnt and found that the thermal contact resistance could contribute up to of the total measured thermal resistance this indicates that the commonly used electron beam induced metal deposition at the contacts may not reduce the thermal contact resistance to neglected level more efforts need to be put to eliminate the thermal contact resistance or measure it out directly although theories have uncovered the intriguing thermal conductivity in systems there is little progress on experiment till the discovery of graphene in graphene provides perfect test field for studying the thermal transport in systems the pioneering experimental studies of thermal conductivity in suspended graphene were carried out based on raman spectroscope measurements the thermal conductivity of exfoliated graphene was found to reach high value of m at room temperature several following experiments on graphene based on raman measurements confirmed its ultra high room temperature thermal conductivity which ranging from m to m similar to the isotopic effect on thermal conductivity of cnt and sinw isotopic doping reduces thermal conductivity of graphene from m to m with concentration besides the raman based thermal measurements on suspended graphene the traditional thermal bridge method mentioned above was also adopted to measure thermal conductivity figs and show the sem images of suspended and supported graphene fig presents the thermal conductance per cross section area of graphene sheet with nm in length and in width interestingly the data at low temperatures can be fitted by w k approaching the ballistic limit in clean graphene proposed by mingo and brodio this temperature behavior of thermal conductance also agrees with the prediction that the out of plane acoustic phonon has dominant contribution to thermal conduction in suspended graphene the thermal conductivity measured in the same work is around m at room temperature which is one order of magnitude smaller than that from the raman based measurements this may be reasonable due to the differences in the sample length as thermal conductivity in lattice models has been predicted to be size dependent even before the discovery of graphene efforts have also been made to study the size dependent thermal conductivity in suspended cvd graphene based on raman measurements however the thermal conductivity was measured to randomly vary from m to m in corbino graphene with diameter range from to the authors attributed this result to the uncertainty in raman measurements as well as the grain boundaries and defects in cvd graphene in addition thermal conductivity in multilayer supported graphene was found to be size dependent the highest thermal conductivity measured is around m at room temperature in m long supported three layer graphene fig interestingly thermal conductivity decreases dramatically with decreased sample size it reduces by when the length of the sample reduces from to s and in fig this size dependent thermal conductivity is expected from the theory that will keep increase with size even when the graphene flake is as long as directly measuring the thermal contact resistance remains the primary challenge in studying the thermal conductivity in nanostructures since it will contribute to the total measured thermal resistance to investigate the intrinsic thermal conductivity of supported multilayer graphene wang et al introduced new method noncontact electron beam heating technique to measure the extrinsic thermal contact resistance directly as shown in fig multilayer graphene is supported by sinx substrate with the two ends covered by cr au thin films labeled as and an abrupt jump in the thermal resistance was observed at both c and d interfaces when the electron beam scanned across region c and indicating half of the total measured thermal resistance is from the two interfaces shown in fig this technique provides direct measurements of thermal contact resistance in nanostructures application of nanostructures thermal rectification in with the development of solid state electronics devices the integrated circuits can be built up by diodes and transistors the conventional diodes and transistors can control the electrical conduction in nature besides electrons and photons phonons can also transport and process information it is straightforward that the realization of their counterpart of phononics device would have deep impacts in recent years more attention has been directed toward the phonon management on energy transport in dynamical systems and the emerging field is described as phononics thermal diodes thermal transistors and thermal logic gates which are the basic components of functional thermal devices have been proposed in theoretical model previously the heat is regarded as useless or harmful in electronic circuits the emerging of phononics raises the possibility that heat could be used to process information in addition to electronics and photonics like electronic counterpart the thermal rectifier plays vital role in phononics circuit it is exciting that the first solid state thermal diode was fabricated in carbon nanotube junction only two years after the theoretical prediction in two segment lattice model in their experiment chang et al modified the mass distribution and geometry diameter along the nanotubes by depositing amorphous h pt at one end the thermal rectification is measured to be around in mwcnt and in three different measured bnnts respectively however the rectifications in these cnt junctions are much lower than that of electronic counterparts to enhance the rectifications many simulation investigations have focused on various lattice modes and asymmetric nanostructures like carbon nanocone fig trapezia shaped gnrs fig two rectangular gnrs with different widths fig triangularly gnrs fig and asymmetric three terminal gnrs fig the thermal rectification effect is observed in m bius graphene strip fig which comes from the nonlinear interaction in graphene and the topological asymmetry of the obius strip interestingly the rectification effect depends on the position of heat bath since it can induce additional asymmetry moreover it was found that the presence of layer layer interactions in graphene junction fig may enhance the rectification effect thus multi layer graphene is better than the single layer counterpart in thermal rectification application next we use carbon nanocone as an example to explore the thermal rectification and the underlying physical mechanism as shown in fig the temperature at top bottom of nanocone is set as tt tb where is the average temperature and is the normalized temperature difference to describe quantitatively the rectifier efficiency we introduce thermal rectification ratio j j where is the heat current from bottom to top and is the heat current from top to bottom fig shows the thermal rectification effect in carbon nanocone in fig when thermal bias is positive the heat flux increases steeply with while in the region the heat flux is much smaller and changes little with thermal bias that is this structure behaves as good thermal conductor under positive bias and as poor thermal conductor under negative bias the increase of results in the increase of the rectification ratio this is similar to the characteristic in electric diode besides homogeneous cncs cncs with graded mass distribution is also considered in which the top atoms have minimum mass mc and the bottom atoms have maximum mass mc where mc is the mass of atom in cnts with non uniform axial heavy molecules deposit the atomic mass ratio is about and the room temperature rectification is only with as shown in fig the rectification ratio is for homogenous nanocone and for graded massed nanocone with this demonstrates that the geometric impact is more effective than the mass impact for high thermal rectification to understand the underlying mechanism of the rectification phenomenon we show the phonon power spectra of atoms at the top and bottom atomic layers with temperature k and single layers coupling in fig the phonon power spectral density psd describes the power carried by the phonon per unit frequency high psd value for phonon with frequency means that there are more states occupied by it zero means there is no such phonon with exist in system the phonon power spectrum analysis provides noninvasive quantitative means of assessing the power carried by phonons in system the spectra are obtained by fourier transforming of velocities here it is shown that the spectra along three directions which were two in plane directions and out plane direction as shown in fig where the bottom atomic layer is at high temperature the power spectra of the top and bottom atomic layers overlap perfectly in large frequency range which means the phonon can easily go through the nanocone along the direction of temperature gradient and correspond to large on the contrary when the top atomic layer contacted with high temperature bath fig there is an obvious mismatch in the spectra both in low and high frequency band which results in very low heat flux the large mismatch in the spectra shows the weak correlation between the two ends as result the phonon is difficult to go through the structure and thus leads to very small the match mismatch of the power spectra between the bottom and top atomic layers controls the heat current and results in the rectification phenomenon in order to quantify the above power spectrum analysis the overlaps of the power spectra of the two layers are calculated as pm int infty rm min left top bot right omega min ptop pbotd where corresponds to the case of and respectively and ptop is the power spectrum of the th top layer and pbot is the power spectrum of the th bottom layer in fig the value of is also shown it illustrates that the heat flux and rectification phenomena correlate strongly with the overlap of the power spectra of the two ends inspired by these theoretical and simulation studies the solid state thermal rectifier were realized in various macroscopic systems and the rectification ratio was enhanced remarkably very recently tian et al demonstrated the thermal rectification ratio up to in trapezia shaped bulk graphene oxide apart from the thermal rectifier the acoustic rectifier was also realized which is fabricated by coupling superlattice with layer of ultrasound contrast agent microbubble suspension significant rectification with rectifying ratio of was observed within two frequency bands xie et al have recently demonstrated solid state thermal memory which can process thermal information with two temperature states as input and output mimicking its electric counterpart their thermal memory device consists of three basic segments an input terminal tin an output terminal tout and heat conduction channel thermally bridging the two fig the two terminals suspended sinx membranes with pt coil on top are thermally connected to substrate tbase through six suspending leads similar with that mentioned above to study the thermal memory effect xie et al used single crystalline suspended vo nanobeam as tunable thermal channel to obtain nonlinear response between tin and tout voltage bias applied across the vo nanobeam is used to tune the characteristic of the thermal memory by applying forward and reverse temperature sweeping loop on tin xie et al presented nonlinear and hysteresis tin tout curve demonstrating bi stable temperature state high low of tout at the same input temperature tin fig which is an essence feature of thermal memory the hysteresis loop was enlarged by applying bias voltage on vo nanobeam and the operating temperature was shift downward fig which is also an important feature of thermal memory both the high and low temperature states at the output terminal are stable and repeatable over cycles with slight fluctuation of in the low temperature state fig the thermal loop was proposed to be related to the first order metal insulator transition mit in vo nanobeam at around resulting in hysteresis in both electrical resistance and thermal conductance at the same temperature range enhancement of thermoelectric efficiency in nano recently thermoelectric materials have attracted extensive attention again this is primarily due to the increasing awareness of the deleterious effect of global warming on the planet environment and renewed requirement for long life electrical power sources thermoelectric materials can provide electricity when subjected to temperature gradient or provide cooling performance when electrical current is passed through it for good thermoelectric material the material must have high figure of merit zt which is proportional to the seebeck coefficient electrical conductivity and absolute temperature but inversely proportional to thermal conductivity many thermoelectric materials have been identified till now such as bi te skutterudites co sb sige alloys pbte et al high zt can be achieved either by increasing the thermoelectric power factor or by decreasing thermal conductivity both methods can be realized via nanostructuring zt enhancement has been achieved in bulk nanocomposites which consist of three dimensional nanograins in traditional thermoelectric materials introducing nanostructures in bulk materials can contribute carriers to the host matrix and they introduce variations in conduction valence band edge which would make the effective band structure different from that of the host matrix moreover the very small size of the nano grains introduces high density of grain boundary interfaces these numerous interfaces scatter phonons more strongly than charge carriers and decrease the phonon thermal conductivity while keeping thermoelectric power factor unchanged recently giant seebeck coefficients have been achieved by controlling nanoparticles size distribution and experiments show that the thermal conductivity decreases with grain size in the thermoelectric bulk materials thus by nanostructuring enhancement in the power factor and reduction in the thermal conductivity are achievable simultaneously resulting in significant enhancement in the value of zt besides the bulk nanocomposites based traditional thermoelectric materials it was found that low dimensional nanomaterials are promising candidates for solid state thermoelectric device applications although their bulk counterparts are with very low zt such as sinws at room temperature zt of bulk silicon is only about however in sinws the electrical conductivity and electron contribution to seebeck coefficient are similar to those of bulk silicon but exhibit fold reduction in thermal conductivity showing that an approximately fold improvement of the zt values over bulk si are achieved in sinw particularly theories and experiments indicated that larger reduction in thermal conductivity can be achieved in nanometer sized low dimensional structures due to the boundary and interface phonon scattering mechanisms it was proposed to use quantum size effects in low dimensional materials to create sharp features in the density of states and enhance the seebeck coefficient benefit from the reduced thermal conductivity and or increased power factor enhanced thermoelectric performance have been observed in nws nts and quasi nanoribbons in this paper we present the state of the art of topic about thermal transport in nanoscale materials we firstly reviewed the fundamental physical phenomena for thermal transport in low dimensional systems and various impacts on thermal conductivity of nanotubes nanowires and graphenes then we provide review on the recent experimental measurements on thermal conductivity and temperature in nanoscale in these low dimensional structures phonon transports super diffusively which leads to length dependent thermal conductivity thus nanoscale materials are promising platforms to verify fundamental thermal transport theories moreover current status of research on applications of nanomaterials include renewable energy and thermal management in nanoscale has been reviewed in this paper based on the present state of the art reviewed here significant progress on understanding of thermal transport in nanoscale was achieved in the past decade however there are still many questions and open challenges remaining on the experimental side one challenge is how to make the sample smaller towards dozens of nanometers or even few nanometers only another challenge lies in the difficulties in measuring the thermal contact resistance at the two ends of sample on the theoretical side it is necessary to establish an improved theory describing thermal transport across the interface by taking into account the anomalous thermal transport characteristics of nanostructures in addition how to set up transport theory by incorporating nonlinearity in the quantum regime is still challenge all these deserve further systematical investigations from joint experimental and theoretical effort  living cells are fascinating demonstration of nature most intricate and well coordinated micromechanical objects they crawl spread contract and relax thus performing multitude of complex mechanical functions alternatively they also respond to physical and chemical cues that lead to remodeling of the cytoskeleton to understand this intricate coupling between mechanical properties mechanical function and force induced biochemical signaling requires tools that are capable of both controlling and manipulating the cell microenvironment and measuring the resulting mechanical response in this review the power of microfluidics as functional tool for research in cell mechanics is highlighted in particular current literature is discussed to show that microfluidics powered by soft lithographic techniques offers the following capabilities that are of significance for understanding the mechanical behavior of cells microfluidics enables the creation of in vitro models of physiological environments in which cell mechanics can be probed ii microfluidics is an excellent means to deliver physical cues that affect cell mechanics such as cell shape fluid flow substrate topography and stiffness iii microfluidics can also expose cells to chemical cues such as growth factors and drugs which alter their mechanical behavior moreover these chemical cues can be delivered either at the whole cell or subcellular level iv microfluidic devices offer the possibility of measuring the intrinsic mechanical properties of cells in high throughput fashion finally microfluidic methods provide exquisite control over drop size generation and manipulation as result droplets are being increasingly used to control the physicochemical environment of cells and as biomimetic analogs of living cells these powerful attributes of microfluidics should further stimulate novel means of investigating the link between physicochemical cues and the biomechanical response of cells insights from such studies will have implications in areas such as drug delivery medicine tissue engineering and biomedical diagnostics mechanical processes like pushing pulling and squeezing play remarkably significant role in the biological function of cell for example such forces turn out to affect biological processes such as cell growth division migration and death in addition mechanical forces at the cellular level impact the function of biological structures ranging from large length scales such as tissues to small length scales such as genes as result it is not surprising that when living cells are affected by disease changes in their mechanical properties also occur indeed cell mechanics has been implicated in variety of diseases such as cancer malaria sickle cell anemia asthma and glaucoma for example cross et al studied individual cells taken from the tissues of suspected patients with various cancers from physiology it is suggested that metastatic cancer cells must be more deformable than healthy cells to be able to invade tissue consistent with this notion individual metastatic cancer cells were indeed found to have lower young moduli measured via atomic force microscope also in suspended state cancerous and metastatic cells could be distinguished from healthy breast epithelial cells via their resistance to optical stretching thus there exists an intimate link between the mechanical properties and the diseased state of living cells from mechanics perspective it is well known that intracellular forces are generated and supported via an intracellular framework called the cytoskeleton this network containing actin filaments microtubules and intermediate filaments is dynamic in nature and is regulated via polymerization and depolymerization rates which in turn are controlled via molecular motors and atp this coupling between intracellular mechanics and chemistry appears to be universal it allows cells to respond mechanically to external stresses by activating biochemical signaling cascades and also underlies the possibility to restore the mechanical properties of diseased cells by pharmacological interventions thus cellular mechanotransduction studies that involve understanding and the control of interactions between mechanical forces and biochemical signaling pathways could lead to novel therapeutic strategies to treat diseases fundamentally understanding cell mechanics is complex problem this is because cells are not only micromechanical objects that support and generate mechanical forces but they are also capable of sensing their microenvironment and adapting to it to understand this intricate coupling requires tools that are capable of both manipulating the cellular microenvironment in controlled manner and also quantifying the resulting mechanical response we believe this is precisely where tools such as microfluidics and microfabrication present an immense opportunity for studies in cell mechanics as summarized in fig these tools are not only capable of creating and manipulating the physicochemical environment of cells but also measuring the intrinsic mechanical properties of cells the goal of this review is to highlight this power of microfluidics and its significance for fundamental and applied studies of cell mechanics the importance of other micro and nanotechnological tools for investigating cell mechanics has been recently reviewed by le duc and co workers recent advances in the basic understanding of cytoskeleton remodeling and the broad suite of techniques available for characterizing the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton have been reported elsewhere in addition soft lithographic procedures to fabricate microfluidic channels structured elastomeric substrates and multilayer devices have been reviewed elsewhere microfluidic devices mimic in vivo cellular the last decade has witnessed revolutionary advances in the manipulation of fluids at small scales this growth has been driven by the potential that microfluidic devices can perform fast reliable and high throughput biochemical analysis using only minute quantities of samples and reagents in addition microfluidics has become such powerful tool that its application has been extended from analyzing simple systems such as proteins and dna to more complicated biological systems such as living cells this concept of cells on chips is appealing from cell mechanics point of view because microfluidic systems can be built that mimic the in vivo environment of cells allowing mechanical behavior of cells to be studied under almost physiological conditions with minimal consumption of reagents one general consideration that needs to be assessed during cell culture in chips is the degree of cell viability in given microfabricated device apoptosis assays especially on adherent cells are employed as sensitive test to ensure that the microfluidic device and the culture conditions used do not negatively influence the cellular behavior several studies have shown normal cell viability in polydimethylsiloxane pdms chips for as long as few weeks besides pdms cell culture has been performed in devices made with other materials such as silicon dioxide and glass even in these devices good cell viability has been demonstrated however devices fabricated with different materials require different strategies to ensure delivery of gases oxygen and carbon dioxide in glass chips this has been achieved by gas dissolution in the liquid whereas in pdms devices gas permeation through the walls suffices in one study the thickness of the pdms was varied between microns and several millimeters without noticeable effects on cell viability also nongaseous nutrients and secretion products need to be transported to away from the cell since diffusion is slow liquid flow is often needed to ensure this however careful design of the channel geometry is needed to ensure undesirable shear induced activation of gene expression the amount of shear stress that can be endured without significant changes in cell state depends on the cell type while this implies that different maximum shear stresses apply for different types of cells it should be noted that the chip design is generally flexible changing the channel dimensions is straightforward way to change the flow stress apart from flow fields cell viability under the application of external fields that are often incorporated into microfluidic devices for cell manipulation has also been addressed for example the sorting of cells using dielectrophoresis or optical forces does not appear to perturb cell physiology appreciably under well controlled conditions also ultrasound has been applied to cells inside microfluidic chips without significant loss of viability given that many studies have shown good viability of living cells in microfluidic devices there is ample scope to use microtechnology to design and mimic in vivo cellular microenvironments an excellent case for example is the recent growth in using microfluidics to develop minimal models of the microvasculature number of studies have begun to use microfluidic devices instead of parallel plate chambers to grow endothelial cells and expose them to shear these microfluidic channels of in size are better mimics of the capillaries in the microvasculature because of the matching of the length scales of channels and cells such microfluidic channels have also been integrated with membrane valves and pumps to achieve an automated in vitro microvascular system for long term culturing and shearing of endothelial cells in addition shear stresses of pa are quite easily achieved in microfluidic devices mimicking the hemodynamic shear stresses experienced by endothelial cells apart from using microfluidic devices for microvasculature studies recent development has been the application of two phase microfluidic systems to mimic the physiology and pathophysiology associated with pulmonary airways huh et al were able to demonstrate mechanical injury of airway epithelial cells due to rupture of liquid plugs in microfluidic channels microfluidic devices are also being increasingly used as in vitro model systems for investigating the role of blood cell mechanics in hematological diseases shelby et al used narrow microfluidic channels to investigate the deformability of red blood cells infected with the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum healthy red blood cells were able to pass through these narrow constrictions readily compared to infected cells indicating that infected cells were mechanically more rigid than the healthy cells higgins et al studied sickle cell vasoocclusion in microfluidic device the microfluidic format enabled them to vary number of parameters geometric confinement flow rates oxygen concentration and identify the conditions for the onset of vasoocclusion more recently fletcher and co workers used microfluidic device consisting of successively bifurcating channels to characterize the single cell transit times of red blood cells and neutrophils the transit time distributions of the cells infected with sepsis and leukostasis were found to be significantly different from that of the corresponding healthy cells microfluidics as means to deliver physical cues to microfluidics and microfabrication are versatile means of manipulating physical cues that affect cell mechanical behavior such as fluid flow substrate topography and stiffness and cell shape for example cells can be easily exposed to laminar shear and extentional flows in microfluidic devices more complex flows including pulsatile and chaotic flows can also be generated in microfluidic devices the capability of producing such broad range of flow types in microchannels opens up new possibilities for studying flow induced cytoskeleton remodeling particularly for cells that are sensitive to fluid forces such as endothelial cells soft lithographic techniques allow varying the topography of substrate with feature size ranging from microns to nanometers remarkably cells can sense substrate topography as well as stiffness recent study has shown that the elastic modulus of cells grown on softer substrates is lower than those grown on harder substrates and that cells tend to tune their stiffness to the stiffness of the substrate cancer cells have also been identified via their growth on soft agar gels in certain stem cells it has been demonstrated that their development into highly specialized cells can be steered via the stiffness of the substrate as result microfluidic devices should find increasing application in such studies as the substrate stiffness of these devices can be easily tuned for example the stiffness of substrates fabricated using soft lithography can be varied from kpato kpa microfluidic strategies also allow cells to be grown in microstructures that could be used to study anchorage dependent cells apart from the use of microfluidics to control the physical microenvironment of the cell it also allows control over the shape of individual cells patterning techniques such as microcontact printing are well equipped to control the shape of single cells including introducing anisotropy in shape the basic principle exploits the affinity of adherent cells to regions where the extracellular matrix is present although patterning techniques work well for cells on open substrates coupling them to microfluidic channels requires additional steps including cumbersome alignment the advantage of coupling microfluidic networks and patterning techniques is that the channels provide conduit for delivery of either physical or chemical cues in precise manner such functionality could be useful in endothelial cell mechanics to address the link between cell morphology and flow induced cytoskeleton remodeling in this regard we recently developed multi layer device that has the capability to pattern cells inside microchannels see fig these devices were fabricated in manner similar to membrane valves except that topographical structures were introduced on the roof of the fluid channel the working principle of this device is based on using the deformation of the structured elastomeric membrane sem to mask certain area on the microchannel surface and passivate the unmasked area with blocking agent subsequently extracellular matrix proteins can be introduced that preferentially adsorb in the previously protected area thus depending on the shape of the feature on the sem adhesive islands of various shapes can be obtained figure shows that this technique can indeed provide good control over the shape of cell on microchannel surface microfluidics as means to expose cells microfluidics is capable of delivering chemical cues such as growth factors and drugs to living cells that in turn affect their mechanical behavior the laminar nature of microfluidic flows provides unique possibilities for stimulating cells chemically coflowing streams can be used to deliver chemical cues locally to individual cells see fig takayama et al were the first to apply this principle and demonstrate selective labeling of mitochondria with different fluorescent dyes in endothelial cells the laminar interface in such flows can also be controlled with high degree of spatiotemoral resolution local chemical stimuli have also been delivered using microfluidic flow focusing as shown in fig gradients in concentration of chemical cues including extracellular matrix proteins on substrate can also be easily set up using microfluidic laminar flows motivated by studies on chemotaxis several groups have reported variety of microfluidic networks that are capable of generating simple to complex chemical gradients microfluidic tools to characterize the mechanical properties of so far we have discussed how microfluidics allows regulating the physicochemical environment of cells we now discuss microfluidic strategies that have been developed to characterize cellular mechanical properties in particular biomechanical flow cytometry is well suited for analyzing suspended cells and microstructured elastomeric surfaces and multi layer devices are suitable for characterizing the mechanical behavior of adherent cells below we discuss these tools in detail biomechanical flow cytometry recently several groups have demonstrated microfluidic strategies to screen suspended cells mechanically in microchannels akin to conventional flow cytometry where cells are selectively detected based on fluorescence these recent methods detect cells mechanically in microfluidic devices by exploiting characteristics that are linked to their individual mechanical properties such approaches therefore fall under the category of biomechanical flow cytometry recently fletcher and co workers collectively referred to these approaches as biophysical flow cytometry however we suggest it is more appropriate to categorize these approaches as biomechanical flow cytometry since they are based on cell mechanics typically mechanical property measurements obtained from biomechanical flow cytometry are qualitative compared to more precise techniques such as atomic force microscopy and micropipette aspiration however their advantage lies in throughput see table for throughput reported by various approaches compared to these precise techniques which analyze few cells per day hence biomechanical flow cytometric approaches are suitable for rapid biomechanical diagnosis of diseased state of cells in one of its simplest manifestation biomechanical flow cytometry involves pumping suspended cells through narrow microfluidic channels and subsequently recording the changes in cell size due to shear induced deformation alternative approaches involve measuring the transit time for single cells to pass through narrow channel the transit times can be recorded using optoelectronic or resistive pulse detection methods instead of using single pore recently fletcher and co workers performed many parallel measurements using microfluidic binary tree network that consists of successive bifurcations of large channel into smaller channels in this study cell size and transit times were measured using automated image processing methods this allowed them to delineate the dependence of transit times on cell size and cell deformability and thus establish link between transit time distributions cell deformability and their diseased state instead of measuring transit time due to cell passage through pore abkarian et al reported novel technique called microfluidic manometer to measure the excess pressure drop due to passage of cell in confined channel the microfluidic manometer is fluidic analog of voltage comparator it typically consists of two identical channels the reference and test channels that are connected downstream to form the comparator region see fig to measure the excess pressure drop due to the confined cell fluid flow is generated in both the channels with the cell being present only in the test channel when equal driving pressures are imposed at the channel inlets any increase in the hydrodynamic resistance due to the presence of the cell in the test channel yields corresponding displacement of the fluid fluid interface in the comparator region in practice prior to the introduction of the cell into the test channel calibration curve is generated between known excess pressure drop and measured interface displacement this relation together with the measured interface displacement directly yields the excess pressure drop induced by the traversing cell using this approach abkarian et al were able to demonstrate pressure drop variation due to drug induced changes in the cytoskeleton mechanical properties key determinant of the performance of the manometer for measuring cellular scale hydrodynamics is the calibration curve as it determines the sensitivity of the measurement in abkarian et al the interface displacement was measured from the symmetry line of the comparator and also their geometry involved long comparator section that could smear the interface due to diffusive mixing downstream we recently modified this previous comparator design by introducing split in the downstream section of the comparator as shown in fig the interface displacement due to soft object droplet was measured from the vertex of the angular split as shown in fig figure shows interface displacement as function of excess pressure drop obtained via numerical calculations of the flow field in the comparator also shown is the curve for the comparator geometry used by abkarian et al the results demonstrate that for the smallest excess pressure drops the interface displacement is about an order of magnitude higher in our comparator geometry compared to that of abkarian et al we also investigated the effect of the aspect ratio width height of the geometry and we found that the sensitivity increases with increase in the aspect ratio of the channel we recently demonstrated the applicability of this improved comparator design by measuring the excess pressure drop due to the flow of single confined droplet in microchannel apart from microfluidic devices that use shear flows to assess cellular mechanical properties other field based approaches have also been developed to determine cellular mechanical properties in one technique called the optical stretcher optical forces are used to induce surface stresses on the cell and subsequently determine the cell deformability this approach has been successfully coupled to microfluidic format to screen healthy and metastasized cancer cells recently bao et al reported electroporative induced cell swelling in microfluidic device as marker for cellular biomechanical properties using this approach these authors were able to demonstrate that cancer cells showed higher degree of swelling compared to healthy cells microstructured elastomeric surfaces so far we have discussed microfluidic devices capable of screening suspended cells however the majority of the cells in the human body are adherent cells that prefer to stick to substrates the process of cell adhesion to substrate involves binding to the extracellular matrix spreading and subsequent generation of traction forces that are mediated by the intracellular contractile apparatus thus there is significant generation of mechanical forces during cell adhesion to characterize these traction forces microfabricated elastomeric substrates that typically have microtopography in the form of pillars or posts have been developed the basic principle for extracting the traction forces relies on measuring the deflection of the posts when cell exerts forces on the substrate see fig in the linear regime the deflection of the post is proportional to the exerted force ei where is the young modulus of the elastomer typically pdms is the moment of inertia of the usually cylinder shaped post and is the length of the post thus the structured elastomeric substrates provide direct measure of traction forces with high spatial and temporal resolution recently chen and co workers introduced elastomeric substrates with magnetic posts to actively manipulate cellular traction forces locally using this approach balaban et al and tan et al showed that cells exert constant stress of nn at focal adhesions irrespective of the area and the magnitude of force corresponding to each focal adhesion site by controlling the morphology of the cell and therefore the spread area tan et al further showed that the average force exerted on each post is proportional to the area of cell spreading compared to these two studies du roure et al employed higher density of elastomeric pillars and were able to demonstrate that the adhesion forces at the edge of monolayer are higher than those measured for single cell in most of these studies elastomeric substrates with pillars that are typically in diameter in length and spaced apart have been used the availability of microstructured elastomeric substrates capable of both measuring and manipulating cellular adhesion forces should open up new possibilities to understand the link between external and internal forces that regulate cell mechanics multi layer devices microfluidic devices with deformable membranes have also been recently demonstrated to be capable of measuring cellular mechanical properties these multi layer devices made using soft lithography typically consist of an elastomeric membrane that is sandwiched between two fluid channels that are oriented orthogonal to each other the basic principle underlying the measurement of cellular mechanical properties using this technique is illustrated in fig in the approach devised by solomon and co workers stress is imposed on the cell by pressurizing the control channel which deforms the membrane the resulting strain in the membrane is measured by visualizing the membrane deflection using confocal microscopy structural mechanics calculations based on finite element methods are then used to extract the relative contributions of the membrane and the cell to the measured deformation using this approach the authors were able to measure the young modulus of bacterial biofilms to be kpa additional design calculations revealed that this technique is capable of characterizing soft objects with elastic moduli in the range of pa since the elastic modulus of mammalian cells is typically reported to be kpa this technique is potentially useful for high throughput mechanical characterization of mammalian cells as well in an alternative approach kim et al used much stronger pdms membranes compared to solomon and co workers to essentially compress the cell and measure the resulting deformation or bulge such cell deformability measurements were shown to be biomechanical marker to distinguish breast cancer cells and healthy cells droplet based besides the continuous flow methods discussed so far also droplet based microfluidic systems can be used for creating and manipulating physicochemical environments for cells inside microfluidic chips having individual cells inside microscopic aqueous droplets surrounded by air or oil phase offers additional possibilities for diagnosis or treatment this could for example be the controlled addition of drug or mechanical test one distinct advantage of having droplet environment is that the volume and with it the exchange of material can be kept under control for example drugs can be kept inside as long as needed for incubation additional control over intradroplet concentrations is possible by letting cell droplet coalesce with cell free droplet having well defined amounts of chemicals nutrients drugs and volume using relatively large droplets enables transport of cells without significant stress due to the flow of its surrounding liquid just as in continuous microfluidic systems cell viability in aqueous droplets is an important consideration judicious choice of oil phase and surfactants is required in order to ensure cell viability fluorocarbon oils combined with fluorosurfactants have been shown to exhibit good biocompatibility and also induce less swelling of pdms based microfluidic devices these possibilities have recently come within reach due to tremendous developments in both droplet generation and manipulation droplet generation in miniaturized devices has been typically achieved using either passive junction and flow focusing geometries or active electric electrowetting and acoustic methods there exists plenty of scope to combine both passive and active methods to achieve enhanced flexibility and finer control over drop generation and size in this context we recently developed an electrowetting based microfluidic flow focusing device that offers continuous and much finer digital control over drop size than purely hydrodynamics based devices see fig with respect to single cell encapsulation in droplets different methods have seen the light in the past few years with impressive improvements in reliability high throughput and downsizing in principle each of these methods could be combined with downstream microfluidics module for further cell processing for applications in biomedical diagnostics that favor portability digital microfluidic platforms driven by electrowetting are well suited this could involve an array of individually addressable electrodes with size and pitch tweaked to the size of the droplets electrowetting could then be used to achieve merging and mixing with nutrient or reagent transport and holding at detector site or an on chip reservoir of each individual cell droplet the first implementation of digital microfluidics for cell based assays has been recently realized but considering its potential it is expected that many will follow moreover with electrowetting based manipulation of cell laden droplets unwanted interactions of cells and electric fields are negligible since there is practically no field inside the droplet at low frequencies of the voltage another interesting application of droplets is as in vitro models for living cells confined fluid volumes have been used to interrogate enzyme kinetics mimicking the confined microenvironment of cells also confined cytoskeletal networks have been generated using droplets demonstrating the important role that confinement plays on the mechanics of cytoskeletal networks thus significant potential exists for using droplets to unravel the biochemical and biophysical machinery driving the mechanical behavior of living cells living cells are complex and dynamic systems understanding the coupling between the sheer biological complexity and the cellular mechanical behavior requires tools capable of probing and manipulating living cells in this review we have highlighted the importance of microfluidics as an enabling tool for fundamental investigations in cell mechanical behavior while the current studies primarily make use of relatively simple microfluidic channels the design flexibility of microfluidics and the degree of control of both chemical and physical parameters will allow for analyzing the cells response in unparalleled detail under conditions that will reflect more and more aspects of the complexity of life physical models theoretical and numerical will have to be developed to model the cell mechanical behavior and to interpret quantitatively the information that becomes available from such experiments for example there is need for quantitative modeling to extract membrane and cytoskeleton mechanical properties from micofluidic manometer measurements in turn numerical models can be used to optimize the design of dedicated microfluidic devices for extracting specific properties given the easy optical access the full spectrum of optical microscopy based techniques for analyzing intracellular processes such as signaling pathways is readily combined with microfluidics and thereby provides access to the regulatory network behind the cell mechanical response simultaneously efforts need to be pursued to integrate established rheometric methods such as atomic force microscopy particle tracking microrheology and magnetic twisting cytometry into microfluidic devices in order to extract more specific mechanical information insights from such combined studies may lead to therapeutic strategies for the control and prevention of diseases and the development of miniaturized devices for biomedical diagnostics  there is an increasing need to develop optofluidic flow cytometers optofluidics where optics and microfluidics work together to create novel functionalities on small chip holds great promise for lab on chip flow cytometry the development of low cost compact handheld flow cytometer and microfluorescence activated cell sorter system could have significant impact on the field of point of care diagnostics improving health care in for example underserved areas of africa and asia that struggle with epidemics such as hiv aids in this paper we review recent advancements in microfluidics on chip optics novel detection architectures and integrated sorting mechanisms flow the flow cytometer and the fluorescence activated cell sorter facs are widely used analysis tools in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics these tools greatly facilitate the study of both physical properties g size shape and biochemical properties g cell cycle distribution dna contents of biological samples such as cells information about the cells of interest is obtained optically in nondestructive and quantitative manner flow cytometry is commonly used in variety of biomedical fields for example immunology or cellular and molecular biology allowing studies of cell cycle analysis gene expression levels intracellular cytokine measurement vaccine analysis phagocytosis and much more besides its applications in basic biomedical research flow cytometry has become an important clinical tool to monitor the progression of hematological diseases such as leukemia and aids state of the art facs system can optically screen tens of thousands of cells per second and then sort out specific subpopulation of cells for further analysis enabling studies of rare samples such as stem cells traditional flow cytometry detects and analyzes optical signals angular light scatter or emitted fluorescence to identify individual cells or biological samples figure illustrates simple four parameter g two scattering and two fluorescent signals flow cytometer the suspended cells are introduced to the fluidic system and hydrodynamically focused by sheath flow ensuring that cells travel through the center of the fluidic channel at uniform velocity upon arrival at the interrogation zone the cells are each individually optically interrogated by focused laser beam typically width passing perpendicularly across the channel as shown in fig the optical detection system which consists of lenses mirrors filters and photodetectors collects the detection signals forward light scatter fsc orthogonal side light scatter ssc and several fluorescence bands fl fl etc are simultaneously obtained as each cell passes by the laser beam the fsc line from the laser axis intensity yields information related to particle size and refractive index the light intensity measured by the ssc line located at about from the optical axis generally relates to the degree of internal structure granularity of the cell in addition to these two scatter collection lines simple flow cytometer might include fluorescence channels whereas more high end instruments might be able to discriminate up to colors or even more in addition to two scattering light collection the quality of both the optical and fluidic systems is critical for device performance and reliability the cells must pass through small uniform stable illumination beam at consistent location and light scatter and fluorescence measurements must be obtained from single cell only no coincidence events and be free from excess noise stray light scatter from debris etc photodetectors either photodiodes or photomultiplier tubes pmts collect the optical signals for fluorescence dichroic mirrors split the emission spectrum to route the desired bands to the appropriate pmt while optical filters further define the wavelength band passed to each detector the measured signal intensities for each parameter are used to distinguish between various sample subpopulations g light scatter can distinguish monocytes lymphocytes and granulocytes in leukocyte sample while fluorescence can further distinguish cells by surface antigens such as cd or cd lymphocytes after identification by the optical system downstream sorting system can isolate cells of interest this is typically performed via droplet based approach as cells approach the sorting chamber vibrations break the main fluid stream into charged droplets allowing their paths to be manipulated by pair of electrically charged deflection plates through feedback control system g the decision making process after the cell is detected and identified upstream the polarity of the plates changes in order to deflect cells of interest into the proper collection tubes for postprocessing analysis there are various sources to learn in great depth the principles of flow cytometry and its applications in biomedical or clinical research in addition several comprehensive reviews of chip based cytometry also exist thus this review article will focus on recent advances in developing miniaturized microfluidic flow cytometer where optics and microfluidics are highly integrated on tiny chip for novel functionalities microfluidic flow cytometer there are many compelling reasons to create compact low cost chip based flow cytometer especially one with cell sorting capabilities e facs systems currently both cytometers and facs systems are located in centralized facilities and shared by many users due to their high cost large size and significant cost for maintenance such centralized facilities impose limits on the accessibility of these powerful tools in addition traditional benchtop sorters are often droplet based and thus exposed to air increasing the possibility of generating biohazardous aerosols moreover typical cytometers require relatively large volumes of sample and reagents for analysis further increasing the total cost per run and creating difficulties in realizing certain applications each of these concerns limits the full utilization of the benchtop flow cytometer facs system in various biomedical and clinical applications in spite of its powerful capability to rapidly and quantitatively analyze biological samples lab on chip microfluidic flow cytometers hold promise to overcome each of the above mentioned difficulties their small size and potentially low cost promote portability and affordability by individual laboratories and point of care clinics this is important for obtaining fast accurate results numerous studies indicate that blood transportation time and handling can significantly affect test results thus on the spot test can help produce more consistent and reliable results readily transportable devices can be deployed for testing in remote and resource poor locations such as battlefields or underserved rural areas where medical testing is not widely available microfluidic flow cytometers can operate with small sample and thus reagent volumes lowering the cost of assays and experiments mass producible device would be more widely accessible to both research laboratories and clinics yielding faster assay turnaround and enabling real time studies an integrated optical system would have fewer problems than current systems based on bulk optics in fact highly integrated chip based approach would turn much of the time consuming and expensive work of troubleshooting into simple chip replacement and the probability of hardware failure will be reduced with the optical components integrated together onto single chip this should significantly reduce or eliminate the need for costly service contracts and dedicated maintenance personnel most importantly however an optofluidic flow cytometer offers the potential for innovative architectures and increased functionality that is simply impossible for conventional benchtop systems the high level integration along with parallel processing techniques can be exploited for higher throughput screening even with lower flow speeds closed sorting system reduces potential biohazard risks combined with the ability to integrate functionalities such as fluid pumping sample preparation cell culture and reagent metering and mixing the development possibilities for true lab on chip or micrototal analysis systems tas are endless these are just few of the reasons that over the past decade researchers have strived to miniaturize the flow cytometer onto compact and portable chip while the most advanced microfluidic flow cytometers may not be ready to replace traditional benchtop cytometers in the clinic just yet the necessary technologies to realize this goal are growing fast bridging and in some regards even over reaching the gap between the commercial benchtop systems and the rapidly developing microfluidic platforms there are three core components of benchtop flow cytometers that need to be miniaturized while maintaining performance the fluidic system for introduction and placement of biological samples the optical system for illumination of samples and collection of emitted light both scattered and fluorescent and the sorting system for deflection of samples of interest which requires both real time control and rapid response actuation system the key challenge to developing high performance miniaturized flow cytometers is to figure out how to reduce the volume and cost of these three systems while maintaining adequate performance g detection sensitivity and sorting throughput in this article we look at the major progress toward miniaturizing and integrating these three aforementioned systems along the way we also introduce some recent developments in microfluidic flow focusing on chip light detection and high throughput sorting capabilities from our own laboratory review on recent advancement on in flow cytometry consistent positioning of samples by flow focusing g sample confinement is required to enhance cell sorting purity and to reduce variations in detected signal intensities samples are required to travel at uniform speed to reduce significant variations in signal intensity resulting from illumination nonuniformity consistent placement also minimizes the possibility of coincidence events and false sort incidents researchers have made great efforts in developing effective and elegant focusing methods reynolds number re is frequently involved to characterize different flow types re vl where is the fluid dynamic viscosity is the average velocity of the fluid is the fluid density and is the characteristic length of rectangular channel or the diameter of circular channel at the microchannel scale re is much smaller than thus flow is generally smooth and predictable e laminar flow this dimensionless number also indicates the relative importance of viscous forces compared to inertial forces when re is extremely low e re the stokes flow approximation is made deeming inertial forces to be negligible microfluidic systems in this realm offer the benefit of highly predictable behavior that does not depend on sample size desirable qualities for microfluidic sample positioning system numerous structures have been designed for hydrodynamic flow focusing under this approximation and will be discussed in sec ii more recent studies have made great progress in understanding the regime where re is finite e at higher flow rates or smaller channel dimensions regime requiring inertial effects to be taken into account this understanding of the resulting effects of secondary turbulent flow and inertial migration have led to the development of novel methods of generating three dimensional particle focusing in microfluidic channels which are reviewed in sec ii when fluid flows in pipe surface friction will cause the fluid flow located closest to the walls to travel much slower than the fluid flowing through the center the flow velocity profile thus follows parabolic distribution meaning that particle velocity depends on relative position for microfluidic flow cytometers then if the sample flow is not confined to the center of the channel the fast moving particles in the center of the flow can catch up to slower particles near the wall for detection the result is variation in illumination dwell time or collection integration time resulting in measured intensity variations between otherwise identical samples for sorting the result is reduction in sort purity or false sorting focusing samples to the center of the channel addresses both of these issues hydrodynamic focusing is the most widely used flow confinement technique for microfluidic devices this confinement is typically two dimensional while three dimensional flow focusing is exploited in benchtop flow cytometers by adjusting the relative pressure between the sample flow line and the two flanking sheath flow lines the sample flow can be confined into narrow stream as demonstrated in fig using this approach knight et al demonstrated that an approximately nm sample flow stream can be achieved in m flow channel alternatively hydrodynamic flow focusing can be achieved by applying negative pressure at the outlet and creating the flow rate differences via channel geometry e inducing relative difference in flow resistance this allows fluid focusing using single pumping source in related approach air can be used as the sheath fluid to confine the sample flow while reducing the volume of the clean water needed two dimensional flow focusing constrains the sample flow in the lateral direction however the fluid velocity still exhibits parabolic velocity profile in the vertical direction particles flowing near the top or the bottom surface of the microfluidic channel will travel slower than the particles moving in the center resulting in the same problems mentioned above that is two dimensional flow focusing will reduce but not solve the confinement problem in order to achieve three dimensional flow focusing goranovic et al designed chimney structure to achieve coaxial sample sheathing by injecting sample flow into the sheath flow in perpendicular direction groisman and other groups fabricated multilayered three dimensional microfluidic devices to achieve confinement in the vertical direction however these techniques have not been widely adopted in practice due to increased complication in fabrication process or the need to increase overall fluid flow rates and thus overall particle velocity to exploit the effects of vortices generated by volume changes microchannels can be fabricated with contraction and expansion regions howell et al made chevron shaped grooves fig in the top and the bottom of the channel to wrap the sheath flow around the sample flow they developed microfluidic flow cytometer in which the sample fluid was thus confined to small volume to reduce variations in detection signal intensities similarly lee et al used contraction expansion array microchannel fig to achieve three dimensional flow focusing in single layer device by modulating the flow rate and the number of contraction regions they could control the focused position of the sample stream when re is small but finite g inertial forces can no longer be neglected researchers have utilized the inertial effects in both straight and curved channels to perform three dimensional particle focusing cell sorting fluid mixing and other functionalities an excellent review paper on the recent advancements in inertial microfluidics by di carlo is highly recommended for the readers who are not familiar with the inertial effect in microfluidics channel in the case of simple straight channel rigid particle flowing through microfluidic channel will experience two counterdirectional lift forces one due to wall effect and the other the result of the shear gradient due to the parabolic flow profile e poiseuille flow the result of the balance of these forces is the existence of specific equilibrium positions generally away from the center of the channel that the samples will migrate toward as they flow through the channel as shown in fig the equilibrium position of particles depends on the geometry of the channel and the size of the sample in flow among other parameters using these effects park designed multiorifice microchannel to focus particles to either the center or the side of channel depending on the particle reynolds number one benefit of exploiting inertial effects is the possibility of massively parallel sample focusing without added hardware e multiple pumps hur et al introduced sheathless and label free parallel flow cytometer to increase the throughput for analyzing rare samples in dilute solutions they constructed single inlet which is split into channels so that the injected cells are positioned and spatially ordered by inertial effects as shown in fig below their device allows easier operation accurate detection and differentiation of cells at higher sample concentrations than traditional flow cytometers will allow while operating at throughput of around cells over ten channels most recently oakey et al fabricated staged device including both curved and straight channels to confine particles into single streamline without sheath flow fig they further demonstrated that flow cytometer equipped with this staged structure exhibits performance competitive with that of commercial cytometer with standard hydrodynamic focusing the device is easy to fabricate and eliminates the need for sheath fluid and additional syringe pumps significantly reducing the size of the external fluidic control system their device can operate at higher flow rates which is ideal for high throughput flow cytometry analysis moreover the inertial focusing with the staged structure enables for the high resolution comparable to commercial flow cytometer their work suggests significant role for inertial focusing in the development of inexpensive lab on chip flow cytometers particularly in applications requiring the analysis of high sample concentrations and high purity sorting of pure subpopulations miniaturization of optical detection as stated previously the optical system of the flow cytometer must perform two functions illumination and collection for illumination we require small spot size wide spatial uniformity and collimation or near collimation these requirements increase throughput reduce variation allow angular light scatter measurements and reduce noise from stray light for light collection localized light collection is important the system must collect light from the location of the interrogated sample hence the attention to flow focusing and reject light from other locations e sidewall reflections scatter from passing debris in the sheath fluid etc such localization of collection is imperative for adequate signal to noise ratios in the collection system this is especially true in light scatter measurements as wavelength filters cannot be employed to reduce stray light indeed most flow cytometers are set up such that angular light scatter intensity levels are more than sufficient for detection of even subwavelength particles detection is often limited not by signal intensity but rather by background collection in microfluidic chips with integrated optical systems waveguides and or optical fibers are often employed to route or guide light on the chip based on total internal reflection tir off the shelf fiber optics are readily integrated into microfabricated devices frequently this is accomplished by the use of fiber sleeve which guides fiber insertion to correctly position the fiber see fig the sleeve guarantees coarse fiber alignment however there is likely to be some rotational and translational variation from device to device other approaches include aligning the fiber and then using some sort of fixative polymer epoxy etc to stabilize the fiber fiber optics are often used to easily interface with prototype device or with the device waveguides with the idea that in the future dedicated hardware chip reader would be used to interface seamlessly with the commercialized version of the proposed device in lieu of fiber optics more permanent solution can be found in integrated waveguides fig these can be created in number of ways such as by using photoresist or another high refractive index material to define waveguide cores that are then cladded by surrounding air pockets as microfluidic chips are often created as mold replicated devices another common means of creating integrated waveguides is to fill channel in the device with higher index material such as polydimethylsiloxane pdms or any of various high index liquids creating light guiding core relative to the lower index device body material in each case the waveguide structure is generally created monolithically alongside the microfluidic flow channel requiring few additional steps generally just filling step and no alignment thus waveguide integration adds great functionality to the device at little to no added cost often for prototyping some of the above mentioned fiber integration methods will be used to interface the waveguides to the outside world while fibers and lenses offer good start to optical system integration they are not complete solution as tir based light guiding optics e both fibers and waveguides emit diverging cone of light for interrogation optics this means an uncollimated less directional and nonuniform illumination beam for collection optics this means that the collected light consists not only of the cone of light originating from the cell of interest but also any other light incident on the waveguide that satisfies the tir requirements that is by nature waveguide or fiber only systems do not inherently collect light from localized area the cell of interest in the way that standard imaging system would any collected light originating from some location other than the cell of interest is noise and without method of restricting the collection of this light the resultant noise can significantly degrade the performance of the optical system published sample coefficient of variation cv from microfluidic devices with fiber or waveguide based optical systems appear to reflect this issue the effects of which are often worsened by single dimension flow focusing in such devices polystyrene beads with expected cvs of under generally are typically measured to have scatter cvs of while such devices demonstrate the utility and possibility of integrated optics practically speaking we must reduce the extrinsic variations resulting from excess background collection as well as the issues arising from incomplete flow localization as discussed previously simple refraction snell law can be used to change the light path by lensing fiber or waveguide facet fig the divergence of the illumination light could thus be reduced moving toward collimated or even focused output similarly lensed collection fiber or waveguide could be made to collect light from more localized position camou et al demonstrated lensed fiber sleeves to reduce beam divergence increasing the intensity of the illumination beam similarly lensed waveguide facet has been demonstrated by wang et al to change the diverging light beam into converging light beam reducing the length of the cell interrogation zone and increasing the illumination intensity this single lensed surface approach then provides means of reducing the width of the diverging illumination beam to more efficiently interrogate the sample because the fiber or waveguide is not point source however the light path cannot be focused to point and cannot be well collimated to create more well collimated or well focused light path the source needs to approximate point source e larger lensed surface needs to be positioned farther from the light source to do this we require freestanding lenses freestanding two dimensional lenses can be readily incorporated into many microfluidic chip fig as mentioned above all of the features in mold replicated devices are created monolithically and in fixed alignment by simply transferring the pattern from mask into the mold material the optical functionality of such molded features is determined by shape and refractive index with regard to the shape there is great deal of design flexibility to work with two dimensional lenses are readily formed by including lens shaped pattern on the mask which translated to lens shaped cavity in the device much like the waveguide cavity was filled with high refractive index material to allow it to guide light the lens shaped chambers will be filled with high refractive index material so that relative to the lower index device body they act similarly to traditional glass in air lens beam diverging lenses can also be created and filled with low index material g air to create the same effect with the opposite refractive index contrast note that lenses created in this manner can have any spheric aspheric or parabolic curvature desired this is stark contrast to bulk lenses where such customized shapes can require individual diamond turning making them very costly figure shows two dimensional lenses both air filled and liquid filled integrated into microfluidic chips by simple molding process seo and lee demonstrated significant increase in excitation efficiency by using integrated air filled lenses to confine and collimate the illumination beam godin and lo demonstrated the use of integrated lenses for efficient collection of scattered light in specific range of angles the methods of integrating lenses described above thus allow highly customized optical system design while producing fixed alignment optical systems in an inexpensive fashion however the approach also faces some significant challenges limiting the device performance first the lenses are generally two dimensional although some attempts at developing three dimensional lenses have been demonstrated thus the light path is unaffected in the vertical out of plane direction in addition lenses require optical quality facets rms roughness of of the wavelength and near sidewall angles this requires well controlled photoresist processes specialized silicon etch processes the development of postetch sidewall smoothing process or similarly meticulous processing lastly lenses created in this manner cannot be antireflection coated meaning that even with perfectly smooth surface per surface fresnel reflection loss still exists this can be mitigated by reducing the refractive index contrast but at the expense of lens power the result is limit on the number of lenses that can feasibly be included in an integrated optical system an alternative or supplemental approach to lens based optical system may include an exclusion based approach to light collection that is finding some means of further shaping the divergent light path from waveguide or further restricting the light that waveguide collects to provide more localized illumination and collection without necessarily requiring lenses as supplement to more typical optical systems this approach can involve ideas such as spatial filtering or other means of stray light blocking to enforce more highly localized light collection several authors have demonstrated integrated light blocking elements once again the feature is included on the photomask and transferred into the mold creating chamber in the device by filling this chamber with ink both tang et al and ro et al demonstrated spatial restriction of the illumination beam solid filled apertures have also been demonstrated using an off the shelf opaque pdms polymer similar to creating polymer filled waveguides but with gray black polymer in addition to light blocking elements light excluding elements can also be created by exploiting tir optics and the unique geometries afforded by microfabrication one such device is discussed in sec iii while the above discussion is primarily concerned on devices where the illumination path crosses the fluidic path there are other cases where we want both the light and the fluid to share the same path in order to maximize their interaction several optofluidic waveguide structures coconfining photons and fluids in microchannels have been reported the whitesides group demonstrated liquid core and liquid cladded waveguide structures and yang group demonstrated liquid core and air cladded optofluidic waveguides without three dimensional focusing however light will be lost along direction in both methods cho et al reported liquid core and solid cladded optofluidic waveguide structures by coating teflon af onto the microfluidic channel wall since teflon af has lower refractive index than that of pdms the introduced light can be confined and guided by total internal reflection three dimensionally even if the fluid is only confined two dimensionally thus minimizing propagation loss in this way fluorescently labeled samples can be excited throughout the channel length with single laser fluorescent emission can be detected at multiple spots and as the fluid path is split so is the light path creating fluidically controlled optical circuit this technology offers design flexibility and efficient interactions between light and biological samples for laboratory on chip devices thus enhancing detection sensitivity illumination along the length of the channel can now be applied to highly integrated microfluidic flow cytometer enabling space time coding technologies as will be discussed in sec iv such optofluidic waveguides further enable color space time cost coding see sec iii a novel way to detect multiple fluorescent wavelengths using single photodetector here the focus is on minimizing the size and cost of not just the chip but also the surrounding optical detection system as well this method of discriminating multiple fluorescent colors with single pmt pioneered in our laboratory holds great promise to significantly reduce the cost and size of the total system exclusion based in our laboratory recent advances in integrated light scatter collection techniques have achieved forward scatter cvs as low as even with only two dimensional flow focusing and have made possible the inclusion of both forward scatter fsc here approximately and side orthogonal here approximately scatter ssc optics in the plane of the device typically fluid flow illumination fsc lines and ssc lines are mutually perpendicular but in the chip based architecture there are only two dimensions in which to integrate features in our device the flow channel passes by the illumination waveguide at an angle bit beyond perpendicular this relatively small tilt keeps the resulting reflection losses low while creating sufficient space for scatter collection line orthogonal to the direction of illumination by slightly separating the interrogation locations for the fsc and ssc collection lines incorporating the ssc line becomes even easier as the effective illumination directions at the two collection locations are slightly different as mentioned above this recent work also relies heavily on an exclusion based approach to light collection in these devices shown in fig formerly flat faceted waveguides are redesigned and reshaped to have conical taper that ends in rather small flat entrance facet close to the fluidic channel the result is that light scattered from the cell is collected through the flat facet and is generally unaffected by this waveguide change fig whereas light originating from other locations will generally pass through the angled sidewall of the newly extended waveguide the angled facets utilize combination of high reflectance due to low angle incidence and change of transmission angle due to refraction to alter the light path of this noise preventing coupling into the collection waveguide fig the results are reduced cross talk between cells close to one another and reduced background light collection this approach is specifically enabled by the use of microfabrication platform which allows small high precision geometries located in close proximity to the sample such designs have potential to significantly reduce reflective losses as fewer lens surfaces are required the optics operate at lower index contrast as lens power is not necessarily important for this type of optic and light from the cell is generally incident normal to the surface of the optic further reducing reflective and scattering losses the result is drastically simplified optical system that retains spatial discrimination capabilities this device was benchmarked using and polystyrene beads clear separation of the three bead populations was observed the fsc cvs are and for the and beads respectively the increase in cv with decreasing diameter is likely due in part to the flow focusing apparently to width of and in part to the signal intensity approaching the noise limit for this device and detection setup the ssc cvs from this device are while these cvs seem relatively large the ssc cvs from the commercial device are actually quite large as well work is underway to further reduce the scatter cvs through better flow focusing lower noise detectors and further reductions in stray light in the current state however the scatter cvs are among the best demonstrated by integrated optical systems and are sufficient to allow discrimination of the three bead populations furthermore compared to an effectively identical system created without the tapered features to the waveguides e flat facet only the fsc signal to noise ratio was improved by factor of clearly demonstrating the improvement in collection localization afforded by this system the approach employs far fewer surfaces than lens based designs and offers far better localization of light collection than other lensless designs such as standard flat faceted waveguide approaches in the field of flow cytometry there is constant drive to increase the number of distinct measurements for each cell as each fluorescence band corresponds to distinct fluorescence based measurement of an individual cellular protein or function the quality and quantity of flow cytometry measurements can be significantly enhanced by the availability of additional fluorescent labels thanks to the coordinated successes in developing new hardware fluorochromes and software tools the most advanced systems can measure as many as fluorescent colors finding applications in immunophenotyping or stem cell research unfortunately the detection of so many fluorescence colors requires essentially an equal number of dichroic mirrors optical filters and pmts all adding to the size weight and cost of the system this is the key reason that today benchtop flow cytometers are still bulky and costly thus having only limited use for point of care applications for flow cytometers significant part of the attraction of the lab on chip approach is the reduction in cost and size of the system which ultimately means dramatically reducing the bulk optics and most important the number of pmts the system requires to overcome the one pmt per fluorescence color limitation our group has developed novel fluorescence color detection technology dubbed cost coding for lab on chip flow cytometry applications the technology mimics the working principles of human eyes which can distinguish more than colors using only three types of photoreceptor cells in the somewhat analogous cost coding method fluorescence emission signal is encoded into time dependent signal as each fluorescently tagged cell passes by an on chip spatial and color filter waveguide array the scheme effectively uses the temporal coding created by the spatial filter combined with integrated broadband color filters to encode for spectral signal in the time domain as illustrated in fig the first three identical peaks are space time coded signals and set the reference intensity of each detected fluorescence signal for accurate signal comparisons the following three peaks each with different intensities are cost coded signals which create the unique color fingerprint of each fluorescent color the on chip spatial filter e the beam blocking aperture array in fig is fabricated by filling the aperture cavity with blackened pdms sylgard dow corning the three color filters red green blue are fabricated by filling the channels with material mixed with specific dyes glycerol is used as the base material for the core of color filter waveguides as it is optically transparent and exhibits higher refractive index than the cladding pdms appropriate dyes are mixed with the glycerol to form the red green and blue broadband color filter waveguides to distinguish as many fluorescent colors as possible each color waveguide is designed to possess gradual slope in its transmission spectrum similar to the transmission spectra of photoreceptors found in the combs of human retina in contrast with conventional bandpass filters with sharp narrow transmission windows these more gradual wideband color filters reduce the required number of filters to differentiate multiple colors the fluorescence color information is encoded in the relative signal intensity registered by each color filter waveguide the same principle that has been manifested in the human eye applying the cost technique we have demonstrated that two widely used fluorescent species dragon green emission peak at nm and envy green emission peak at nm can be distinguished using single pmt figure shows the waveform of cost coded signal from the dragon green dye equivalent to fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc fluorochrome commonly used in flow cytometry the first three peaks establish the reference for the fluorescence intensity followed by the three color coded peaks of different intensities figure shows the histogram of the green red ratio from beads labeled with either the dragon green or the envy green fluorophores similarly fig shows the histogram of the blue red ratio of these two groups of fluorescently labeled beads it is clearly shown that these two fluorophores can be differentiated with single pmt by using the cost coding employed in this device in fact our analysis shows that by using the cost technology we can differentiate commonly used fluorophores in flow cytometry by using single pmt major step toward the realization of compact cost effective and multicolor flow cytometers for point of care applications microfluidic fluorescence activated cell sorter traditionally researchers study cellular activities from cell colony containing relatively large number of cells e cells yielding data that represent the general bulk behaviors of cell populations even though cells may appear to be similar morphologically cellular heterogeneity g differences in gene expressions cell proliferation and responses to external stimuli exists both in bacteria and eukaryotic cells in order to recover the rich information g stochastic behavior of individual cells from cell based assays it is essential to extract single cells from population subpopulation of cells as result of significant advances in microfabrication technologies numerous microfluidic cell sorters exploiting various sorting actuation mechanisms g electro osmotic optophoretic hydrodynamic piezoelectric etc have emerged see table table ii lists some of the benefits and detractions of these various sorting mechanisms that have been explored for use in facs systems since fluorescence based assays have been one of the most commonly used bioanalytical tools for researchers this paper will focus on mechanisms that are compatible with fluorescence activated cell sorting facs for other nonfluorescence activated cell sorting mechanisms such as magnetophoresis and acoustophoresis readers can refer to number of recently published articles survey of electro osmotically driven facs has been developed and implemented by number of research groups due to its relatively easy fabrication process insertion of platinum gold microelectrodes and straightforward fluid manipulation application of dc voltage across inlets and outlets the first generation of facs was developed by fu et al who fabricated three channel design in pdms to achieve sorting based on electrokinetic switching as fluorescence from coli made to express fluorescent proteins is detected upstream the triggering of dc voltage across an inlet and two outlets causes fluid switching permitting targeted cells to reach the desired collection outlet in this study sorting throughput of cells and fold enrichment factor were achieved in similar approach another group demonstrated manual sorting of red blood cells by switching the applied voltage potentials across the inlet and outlets dittrich and schwille described another electro osmosis induced sorting method by implementing hydrodynamic fluid focusing before subjecting the sample fluid to dc electric potential in y sorting junction fig by switching the polarity of the applied dc voltage at the sorting junction the sample flow could be deflected either to the right or left channels the authors demonstrated tenfold enrichment at throughput of cell electro osmosis based sorting generally suffers from ion depletion low throughput high power usage and low cell viability due to the use of high electric field dielectrophoretic dep facs employs gentler electric field based sorting mechanism by using ac voltage in the megahertz range the direction of the dep e positive or negative dep forces experienced by the analytes is determined by the relative polarizability between the surrounding fluid and the analytes g beads or cells unlike electro osmosis which achieves sorting by moving particles along with the fluid dep moves particles relative to the fluid motion in the earlier work dep forces were used to trap cells of interest such as in the eight electrode quadrupole cage to allow trapping of cells following this work another research group designed and implemented arrayed quadrupole dep traps to manually hold and isolate fluorescent cells against pressure driven fluid flows while sorting throughput is low the advantage of this approach is that biochemical assays can be readily performed on these trapped cells as flow is permitted allowing sorting and monitoring of cellular responses on single chip in addition to cell trapping holmes et al achieved particle deflection by embedding two electrode system oriented parallel to the flow causing dep forces perpendicular to the fluid flow fig the design enables deflection of individual beads at rate of beads under an applied voltage of vp at mhz in an automated sorting system the authors achieved an actual throughput of particles in fluorescence activated dep sorting the throughput is limited because dep forces are generally too small relative to the hydrodynamic drag force to rapidly deflect the cells from the flow stream in addition the fabrication process for dep cell sorter is fairly extensive and most of the microfluidic dep systems require buffer solutions of much lower conductivity than standard buffers finally the dep force has third power dependence on the particle size when the size of the particle is smaller than the dep force is too small to be practical thus dep based sorting cannot be applied to separate bacteria or viruses optical forces have also been used for the trapping and sorting of living cells wang et al demonstrated an optically controlled facs using an acousto optic modulator controlled ytterbium laser for cell manipulation fig various mixtures containing green fluorescent protein gfp expressing and non gfp expressing hela cells ratios of and were used to characterize the sorting performance sorting throughput of cells and enrichment factors of fold were obtained although the purity of the sorted samples was relatively high most are compared to the results from other facs systems the use of the bulky expensive high power laser as well as the accompanying elaborate optical setup is unfavorable for miniaturization additionally much like dep sorters the limitation on flow rates due to the relative weak optical forces seriously limits the detection throughput of optical facs systems sorting based on hydrodynamic flow switching on the other hand is typically not limited by the flow or particle speed and therefore the method generally produces high detection throughput cells by manually controlling syringe pump kr ger et al redirected the flow from waste channel to collection channel due to the slow mechanical response of the syringe pump the maximum sort rate is only particles using faster external check valve response time of ms wolff et al demonstrated fluorescence activated sorting by actuating the valve upon detection of targeted particles as illustrated in fig in this study the authors sort fluorescent beads from mixture of beads and chicken red blood cells achieving detection throughput of cells and an enrichment factor of fold instead of employing external actuators for sorting fu et al integrated the pdms membrane based diameter microvalves ms theoretical response time on chip to manipulate the fluid flow using multilayer soft lithography the upper layer contains channels that are pressurized vacuumed by an external pneumatic actuator which in turn causes the closing opening of the microvalves with the pneumatically actuated valves sorting throughput of cells is achieved and the enrichment factor could be as high as fold even though sorting based on hydrodynamic flow switching generally offers high throughput and enrichment capabilities causes minimal cell damage and is not subjected to buffer incompatibility issues the mechanical actuators g external valves syringe pumps and pneumatic pumps employed usually suffer from limited response times and are generally bulky hindering progress toward miniaturization integrated facs to circumvent the use of bulky actuators chen et al recently demonstrated sorting mechanism based on piezoelectrically actuated flow switching fig by integrating piezoelectric pzt actuators response time of ms on chip using uv ozone based bonding methodology the authors can switch fluid flow to achieve high throughput cells using low applied voltage vp to further the study cho et al recently incorporated the optofluidic waveguide technology into the chip to achieve high efficiency illumination by guiding light inside the teflon af coated microfluidic channel the method enables detection at multiple locations along the fluidic channel in addition the authors have designed spatial filter complemented with low timing jitter electronics system field programmable gate array based with preprogrammed real time signal processing algorithms figs c to perform high speed real time sorting the system architecture described above illumination spatial filter and digital signal processing dsp algorithms offers several unique advantages over other facs systems including fast and low powered sorting real time signal amplification and sorting event verification as shown in fig as fluorescent particle passes the detection region the encoded signal detected by the pmt would result in three lobed signal e by using finite impulse response filter the real time dsp can amplify the detected signal by db once the amplified signal reaches the user defined threshold the system generates an output voltage waveform after set time delay to trigger pzt actuation for sorting once the targeted particle is sorted to the right or left channel the encoded signals from the spatial filter would register as or informing the user of the success of sorting event as illustrated in fig on the other hand the absence of the verification signal signifies an unsuccessful sorting attempt the capability to verify each sorting event in real time allows users to optimize the sorting conditions e sample flow rate timing delay actuator driving voltage threshold setting etc during the experiment with this integrated facs architecture the sorting of beads mammalian cells fig and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish labeled coli at throughput of cells and an enrichment factor of highest among facs systems has been demonstrated although the moflo high end commercial facs still outperforms the integrated facs under similar sorting conditions achieving fold enrichment factor at particles the much greater complexity size and the cost of the moflo must be taken into consideration the current pzt integrated facs still lacks three dimensional focusing as well as light scattering detection capabilities which are two main factors contributing to the performance gap by integrating d flow module such as the chevron structures demonstrated by the ligler group velocity variations in the direction could be minimized enhancing the sorting efficiency and reducing sorting errors moreover the forward scattering fsc parameter can be readily incorporated by integrating on chip waveguides and or lens structures that allow in plane optical excitation and collection with the fsc information control algorithms can be implemented to abort the sorting of cells that travel too close to each other to avoid the coincidental errors these developments could lead to truly handheld lab on chip cell sorting device at cost of times lower than the commercial facs making the technology affordable to individual clinics hospitals and research laboratories microfluidic flow cytometers offer the benefits of significant size and cost reduction as well as reductions in required sample and reagent volumes in addition microfluidic platforms offer the integration of functional components such as sample pretreatment g cell lysing or staining and postsort cell culturing to create micrototal analysis system on chip tas disposable chips further provide sterile testing environment reducing the chance of cross contamination and the risks of handling biohazardous samples such closed integrated testing platform will provide further time and cost savings for researchers and clinicians ultimately opening new doors for biomedical research the development of microfluidic flow cytometer may be the advance that brings cytometer to every research laboratory expediting discovery and understanding in areas such as cancer research drug development and genetics low cost portable devices could allow hiv monitoring in remote areas of africa and asia helping antiretroviral drugs make their way to patients in need low cost microfluidic devices could further help patients in affluent countries to receive faster test results and may reduce the amount of blood required for testing there are however number of important obstacles to overcome in order for microfluidic flow cytometers to rival and eventually replace current benchtop flow cytometers microfluidic systems first of all should be able to deliver all cells regardless of polarizability size etc along the microfluidic channel at uniform speed regardless of the flow rate to prevent coincidence events at the interrogation zone and false sorting at the sorting junction integrated optical detection systems must demonstrate their ability to truly rival the sensitivity and resolution of benchtop flow cytometers to date considerable progress has been made toward achieving these critical benchmarks but there is work remaining to be done in addition selecting the right material and developing proper mass fabrication techniques are essential to lowering the cost of the microfluidic flow cytometer further while miniaturized optofluidic cytometry chip addressing each of these issues may sound like total solution the size of the whole system must still be addressed components such as the lasers detectors fluidic pumps actuators and electronics can make the final chip interfacing system considerably larger in turn making the entire ensemble less attractive for practical on the spot testing or point of care applications many researchers are working to resolve these issues resulting in the novel approaches discussed in this work fluid focusing using inertial effects in fluidic channels may enable reliable three dimensional fluid focusing without the use of additional fluidic pumps enhancing the quality of signals and reducing the size of the fluidic system newly demonstrated multicolor detection technology invented by the lo group known as cost coding holds great promise for compactness by fundamentally altering the scaling rule e the number of required optical components will no longer scale linearly with the number of detection parameters optofluidic waveguides can be used to enhance the coupling efficiency of photons to samples thus increasing sensitivity and permitting multispot illumination lastly the demonstration of fast response deflectors g pzt actuators in conjunction with high speed low jitter closed loop control systems shows potential for microfluidic sorters to greatly exceed the demonstrated cells holding promise to rapidly move into the realm of being competitive with benchtop sorters upon satisfying these stringent yet quite achievable requirements the field of optofluidics holds great promise for flow cytometry offering the development of low cost compact portable flow cytometer and facs system that can be readily afforded by individual clinics and research laboratories more importantly such an emerging technology could provide point of care diagnosis and analysis in remote areas of africa and asia that continue to struggle with widespread epidemics such as malaria and hiv in short the development of the compact low cost microfluidic flow cytometer promises to improve global quality of life and although the technology is not fully ready today great strides have been made and continue to be made toward achieving this goal  we describe the design and current performance of the backscattering silicon spectrometer basis time of flight backscattering spectrometer built at the spallation neutron source sns of the oak ridge national laboratory ornl basis is the first silicon based backscattering spectrometer installed at spallation neutron source in addition to high intensity it offers high energy resolution of about ev and large and variable energy transfer range these ensure an excellent overlap with the dynamic ranges accessible at other inelastic spectrometers at the sns the time of flight neutron scattering spectrometers utilize either direct scattering geometry when the initial energy of the neutrons incident on the sample ei is selected by monochromator or choppers or inverted scattering geometry when the final energy of the neutrons scattered by the sample ef is selected by the analyzer crystals the technique known as backscattering is the limiting case of the inverted scattering geometry that utilizes energy analyzer crystals with fixed bragg reflection angle at or near this geometry minimizes the energy resolution of the analyzer according to the following expression documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation delta rm e rm left frac delta d cot theta delta theta right end equation end document ef ef dd cot which can be easily obtained by differentiating bragg law here d is the spread of the analyzer lattice constant and is the bragg angle the second terms in the bracket is minimized when approaches thus the term backscattering neutron backscattering spectrometry is characterized by high energy resolution often on the energy scale of ev the scattering at such low energy transfers probes dynamic processes on the nano second time scale in typical neutron time of flight experiments much faster processes on the pico second time scale are usually probed whereas neutron spin echo can be used to probe much slower processes on the tens and hundreds of nano seconds time scale neutron backscattering can thus bridge the gap between the time scales probed in neutron time of flight and spin echo experiments the precision with which the neutron energy transfer ei ef can be determined that is the overall energy resolution depends on accurate knowledge of both the initial energy ei and the final energy ef the precision of the latter is determined mainly by the analyzer crystals type and arrangement according to eq utilization of the backscattering geometry when is near minimizes the spread in the measured ef most backscattering spectrometers have been built at neutron research reactors that provide continuous beam where some kind of monochromator is needed to set up the ei for the neutrons incident on the sample the variation of the ei is then achieved by means of either varying the temperature of the monochromator with respect to that of the analyzer thereby changing the lattice constants of the monochromator and the ei or doppler moving the monochromator the latter approach requires much shorter measurement times and is usually adopted even though the former approach allows measurements over much larger dynamic range not limited by the range of the doppler driven monochromators in either case the spread in ei is determined by the monochromator and is typically similar to the spread in the ef this can yield sub ev overall energy resolution at reactor based backscattering spectrometer such as in and in at the ill france hfbs at the ncnr usa and spheres at the frm ii jcns germany at the same time these backscattering spectrometers suffer from the somewhat limited dynamic range achievable with doppler driven monochromators presently some ev at best these spectrometers use silicon analyzer crystals and monochromators where the d is controlled by introducing elastic deformation of the crystals the perfect backscattering geometry employed at these spectrometers requires detector positioning in the horizontal plane behind the sample that is the neutrons pass through the sample twice on their way to the detectors the time of flight tof backscattering spectrometers tof bss typically built at spallation neutron sources do not use monochromators instead the neutron ei is determined from the overall time of flight between the neutron source and the detectors the dynamic range is limited only by the frame overlap and is determined by the combination of the source repetition rate neutron flight path distances and choice of the bandwidth limiting choppers energy transfers of several hundred ev are easily achievable the energy resolution however is coarser compared to that of the reactor based backscattering spectrometers to the first approximation it can be written as documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation delta e sqrt left frac delta d cot theta delta theta right left frac delta rm tof rm tof right end equation end document e dd cot tof tof the problem is that it is difficult to reduce the time of flight term which decreases with the increasing flight path distances below certain economically feasible limit it is often more practical to intentionally coarsen the other term in order to match the contribution from the time of flight term thus increasing the signal intensity without degrading the resolution much while tof bss built on spallation neutron sources profitably utilizes pulsed structure of the incident neutron beam its design should find reasonable balance between the energy resolution dynamic range signal intensity accessible range etc unfortunately these parameters of merit are often in direct conflict with one another for instance high energy resolution is achieved at the expense of signal intensity longer neutron flight paths improve the resolution but adversely affect the dynamic range range suffers when analyzer crystals with large spacing are used in an attempt to improve the resolution etc in practice it is the primary flight path moderator to sample that defines the term tof tof because the moderator to sample distance is typically much longer compared to the sample to analyzer and analyzer to detector distances to match the analyzer resolution to that of the primary flight path choosing bragg angle of as typical for the reactor based backscattering spectrometers is usually impractical for tof bss as it would require extremely long primary flight path to make the tof tof term sufficiently small to match the d term in principle there exists possibility to use shorter flight path in conjunction with pulse shaping chopper which could reduce the tof term well below the value provided by the moderator however this comes at price of the reduced dynamic range and neutron flux thus relaxing the cot term through the selection of the near backscattering bragg angle less than is common for tof bss but not for the reactor based backscattering spectrometers despite the lower tolerance to the vertical extension of the analyzer panels compared to the true backscattering geometry the near backscattering geometry has its advantages for instance with the detectors positioned above and below the horizontal scattering plane detected neutrons do not have to travel through the sample twice and therefore both sides of the instrument tank can be populated with analyzer crystals and detectors until recently practical realizations of tof bss included use of either pyrolytic graphite pg or mica analyzer crystals in both cases the d term is controlled through the selection of the desirable crystal mosaicity for example the lam et spectrometer built at the kens japan had primary flight path of about and used reflections from mica analyzers with an off backscattering bragg angle of in this case the contribution to the resolution from the d term was small compared to that of the cot term it has been generally true that mica based backscattering spectrometers in the past suffered from low intensity problems for instance the iris spectrometer with primary flight path of which was built at the isis uk and is currently in operation also has mica analyzer crystals however its pg analyzers have been used much more often for the main working reflection pg d with the moderator pulse width tof a match between the resolution contributions from the primary and secondary spectrometers was achieved at near backscattering bragg angle of with the analyzers spatially extended in the current resolution using the pg reflection is ev the graphite analyzers of the iris need to be cryogenically cooled in order to suppress thermal diffuse scattering from graphite the osiris spectrometer built at the isis more recently and conceptually similar to the iris has significantly higher flux and somewhat coarser energy resolution of ev with the pg reflection with the mica based tof bss suffering from the low intensity and very limited range and the pg based tof bss having the energy resolution well above ev there has been need for tof bss with higher energy resolution approaching that of the reactor based backscattering spectrometers yet with sufficiently high scattering signal new tof bss basis constructed at the spallation neutron source at oak ridge national laboratory usa entered the general user program in the late this is the first realization of silicon based tof bss hence the name basis which is an acronym for backscattering silicon spectrometer it features long primary flight path of and si analyzer crystals with d at near backscattering angle of different from the previously built tof bss the silicon analyzer crystals of the basis are near perfect have no mosaicity the spread of the silicon lattice parameter is carefully controlled by introducing the elastic deformation of the crystals similar to the reactor based silicon backscattering spectrometers the design and performance of the basis are described in detail in the next sections the basis employs for the first time in the history of bss tof instruments si analyzer crystals which provides an opportunity for high energy resolution and dictates other spectrometer parameters needed to maintain the overall high resolution the resolution can be estimated using the time of flight ti

the sns beamline illuminated by decoupled supercritical hydrogen centerline poisoned moderator with the emission time width of about for the wavelength of incident neutrons travel to the sample position through an long supermirror guide its geometry is described in detail in table in brief the upstream sections of the guide have horizontal curvature of radius with the direct line of sight ending at about from the moderator the curved guide helps eliminate fast neutrons and gamma rays at from the moderator straight guide section smoothly joins the curved guide the coating of the guide sections varies the last section of the tapered guide has importantly the first sections of the guide are placed inside the core vessel and the primary shutter thereby providing an increased incident neutron flux the guide has several gaps to accommodate the primary and secondary shutters and bandwidth selection choppers positioned at and from the moderator both the curved and straight guide sections have rectangular cross section of cm height and cm width at all distances but the last of the guide where tapered supermirror sections compress the beam to cm by cm at the exit of the guide at cm upstream the sample position in fact part of the last funnel section of the guide resides inside the spectrometer tank system of slits vertical and horizontal which allows restriction of the incident beam size and the incident beam monitor at cm upstream the sample position are located between the exit of the guide and the sample position figure shows snapshot of the beam at the sample position taken with an image plate with the slits fully open and not interfering with the beam and the incident wavelength band centered at the divergence of the beam was measured to be slightly above mrad in both vertical and horizontal directions figure shows the incident spectrum measured at the incident beam monitor close to the sample position with the bandwidth selection choppers resting in the open position and the source frequency of hz so that the measured time frame width the interval between the successive neutron pulses is and the frame overlap is completely avoided the spectrum which has been normalized to the efficiency of the monitor is product of the moderator output the guide transmission function and the absorption in the aluminum windows that the incident beam passes through during regular operation at the source frequency of hz when the time frame width equals the choppers must be rotated to eliminate frame overlap and restrict the dynamic range the basis choppers see fig are aluminum disks coated with boron loaded epoxy layer with transmission of less than for neutrons and have open sectors cut in the disks the open angles are for the chopper at for the chopper at and for the chopper at at the source frequency of hz phasing the choppers that are rotating at hz at desirable value of the wavelength band center results in the incident bandwidth of with the choppers fully open regardless of the selected center of the wavelength band in the quasielastic scattering regime the choppers are phased to transmit the bandwidth centered near the si elastic reflection of which provides an energy transfer range of about ev use of the data collected with the choppers partially open or closed extends the energy transfer range attainable in the quasielastic regime beyond ev alternatively the choppers can be operated at frequency lower than the hz frequency of the sns thereby greatly extending the incident bandwidth g at hz to with the choppers fully open such an extension which leads to the concomitant extension of the accessible dynamic range comes at price of the reduced intensity due to elimination of some neutron pulses regardless of the selected frequency and the bandwidth center of the choppers it is usually practical to make sure that the transmitted wavelength band includes so that the elastic line is present in the measured spectrum the spectrometer tank is evacuated down to below mtorr as required for the detectors operation and employs extensive background reducing shielding at various locations the sample chamber which is typically also evacuated to reduce the background though it is not required for operation is separated from the main spectrometer tank by thin aluminum window this allows quick replacement of sample environment equipment without breaking vacuum in the main tank the sample chamber opens at the top of the spectrometer tank from where the sample environment equipment is installed after exiting the guide and traveling through the system of slits the incident beam monitor and the separation aluminum window the incident neutrons arrive at the sample position the neutrons that assume energy of ev wavelength of after scattering by the sample can be subsequently bragg reflected by the analyzers toward the detectors as illustrated schematically in fig note that on the way from the sample to the analyzer crystals and back to the detectors neutrons have to pass through radial collimator with separation between the vertical blades which restrict the view of the sample and reduces the background the analyzer panels inside the basis tank are shown in fig presently one half of the spectrometer tank is populated with si analyzer crystals that cover about in the horizontal plane and about in the out of plane directions thus providing coverage of about sr or of an important improvement in the resolution was achieved by using two sets of panels instead of one the upper and lower spherical panels split in the middle in the horizontal plane as one can see in figs and the upper and lower spherical panels have focal points at cm above and below the sample position respectively thus reflecting scattered neutrons toward the separate detector banks positioned above and below the horizontal plane the si crystals are nearly perfect thus the desired d is achieved much like on the reactor based silicon backscattering spectrometers by means of elastically straining silicon through press gluing hexagonal crystal wafers mm thick cm diagonal onto the spherical support panels of radius this is challenging task since such the large wafer thickness borders the breaking limit for silicon material the bragg angle of about was selected to nearly match the contributions from the primary and secondary spectrometers thus bragg reflected neutrons have wavelength of energy of ev the top and bottom detector arrays which form circular detector banks above and below the horizontal plane as shown in fig are comprised of linear position sensitive he tubes each each tube has diameter of cm an active length of cm and is filled with he at atmospheres the total flight path from the sample to analyzer crystals to the detectors see fig which includes the constant contribution of from the sample to analyzer distance varies between and around mean value of depending on the out of plane angle of the neutron scattered by the sample the variations as function of the detector pixel height in the flight path and less importantly in the bragg angle and the reflected neutron wavelength are accounted for in the data reduction software which converts time of flight into energy transfer independently for each detector pixel since the exact flight path and the final wavelength are known for each detector pixel assuming point sample the incident energy and thus the energy transfer ei ef can be calculated from the total time of flight of the detected neutrons the value of the scattering momentum transfer can be calculated in similar fashion as ki kf kikfcos it is important to note that the implemented detector scheme allows generation of reduced data sets at true constant values because of the large accessible energy transfers this is of greater importance for tof bss compared to reactor based bss the latter typically use the elastic approximation ki kf which yields qel sin single value defined by the nominal scattering angle is usually assigned to each detector tube the range of and energy transfers accessible on the basis as shown in fig is calculated from the known values of the scattering angles covered by the analyzer panels and the detectors which vary between min and max in the most often used quasielastic regime of operation the accessible range is between and the accessible range of energy transfers may extend beyond mev thanks to the fact that incident neutrons with wavelength as low as are still transmitted by the spectrometer guide system in small but appreciable numbers it is important to emphasize that unlike in the quasielastic regime of operation the entire range shown in fig cannot be accessed in one set of measurements it will require collecting and putting together many data sets measured with different chopper settings of the center of the incident bandwidth to continuously cover the entire range shown in fig this difficulty is somewhat alleviated by the fact that the energy transfer range accessible with particular set of chopper phasings increases greatly at shorter incident wavelengths despite the always constant value of when the choppers are operated at hz this is because the incident energy and energy transfer depend on the incident wavelength in non linear manner ei currently efforts are under way to build additional crystal analyzer panels for the presently unpopulated side of the basis tank which may include both the si panels of improved design and different types of analyzer crystals however here we discuss the performance of the basis in the present configuration that uses the original set of si analyzer panels on one side of the instrument tank the averaged data for vanadium standard of annular geometry presented in fig shows resolution of approximately ev fwhm on the negative energy transfer side longer tofs there is additional broadening visible mostly on the linear intensity scale this is well known and expected effect due to the moderator emission spectrum on the logarithm intensity scale there is additional broadening visible at the footstep of the elastic peak on the positive energy transfer side this broadening originates from the specific design of the existing analyzer panels and may be eliminated in the future panels thus providing sharper edge of the resolution peak at fig also demonstrates the signal to background ratio at the elastic line achieved to date which well exceeds again this ratio is expected to increase even further with the introduction of the improved analyzer si panels importantly the basis possesses an excellent energy resolution at the inelastic energy transfers of about of ei which makes possible high resolution measurements of various excitations within the region shown in fig the resolution of the basis when operated in quasielastic regime varies from about at the low scattering angles to about at the high scattering angles figure shows qens spectrum collected from room temperature ionic liquid nc dma beti hydrogen bearing liquid and powder samples that yield predominantly incoherent scattering signal are studied on the basis most often the sample was loaded in mm thick annular cylindrical aluminum container mm in diameter mm in height and measured at for about hours the sns power at the time was about mw the data shown in fig are plotted using ev energy binning the presence of an asymmetric background discussed in detail in ref is evident in both the data and fits importantly the wide dynamic range of the experiment was instrumental in comparing between different model scattering functions that both yield reasonable fits yet represent very different scenarios of diffusion processes while the averaged energy resolution value for an annular sample with standard dimensions is about ev as shown in fig we have found significant dependence of the resolution on essentially the scattering angle the best resolution is achieved at the lowest scattering angles whereas the highest scattering angles are associated with the coarsest resolution this is an effect due to the sample geometry dependent correlations between the incident and final flight paths li and lf which is not predicted by eqs that assume independent distributions of various uncertainties around their mean values in reality the flight path lengths are somewhat correlated as explained schematically in fig leading to the or angular dependence of the resolution function for an annular sample assuming that the incident neutrons with arrive simultaneously and with no divergence at the plane that contains the point and is perpendicular to the incident beam direction the total time of flight from this plane to the analyzers that are much far away from the sample will vary depending on the direction of the scattered neutrons for the forward scattering direction the arrival time at the analyzer would be the same for the neutron scattered elastically from the sample at the points d and for the scattering at the neutrons scattered at the points and will arrive at the analyzer first followed by the neutrons scattered at the points and which will be delayed by d where is the sample diameter and is the neutron velocity an even bigger spread will be seen for the neutrons scattered in the back scattering direction the neutrons scattered at the point will arrive at the analyzer first followed by the neutrons scattered at the points and and delayed by d followed by the neutrons scattered at the point and delayed by d with respect to the neutrons scattered at the point thus the resolution is expected to worsen at higher scattering angles as observed experimentally similar effect is known for the direct geometry tof spectrometers as well where the neutrons arriving directly at the detectors following scattering from the sample experience larger spread of arrival times at higher scattering angles the relative strength of this effect should depend on the characteristic tof of the scattered neutrons through the sample for the basis with typical annular sample diameter of cm and the neutron velocity at the elastic line of s the characteristic tof through the sample v is about this is comparable with the other leading contributions to the overall resolution such as the moderator emission time width so the angular resolution dependence is quite pronounced on the other hand flat plate sample with orientation of its normal that is orientation of its plane with respect to the incident beam on the basis yields almost independent resolution of about ev fwhm for the scattering angles up to this is well known geometry focusing effect when the sns power was about mw measurement of the incident neutron flux at the sample position in quasielastic regime choppers at hz incident wavelength band centered at yielded value of about cm more practically important are the data collection rates with vanadium standard of transmission the count rate of about ct sec integrated over all detectors was obtained in the elastic time of flight channel of s width which corresponds to ev width of an energy transfer bin at the elastic line the raw data collected from standard annular vanadium samples in minutes and integrated over all detector pixels are shown in fig as counts per tof channels the projected power of the sns not considering possible future upgrades is mw thus an improvement in the data collection rate by almost factor of can be expected recent studies of spin ice compound ho ti and its derivatives provide good illustration of the current basis capabilities as shown in fig in addition to the strong quasielastic signal one can see the sharp excitations at ev that were attributed to the transitions between nuclear spin states of ho split by the hyperfine field the basis possesses simultaneously the high energy resolution and relatively large dynamic range as well as the high signal to noise ratio that is more than sufficient to resolve these weak less than of the elastic intensity excitations with its high energy resolution and variable dynamic range basis is perhaps the first operating instrument that provides an excellent overlap between quasielastic neutron scattering qens measurements carried out on the inverted geometry backscattering and direct geometry time of flight cold neutron spectrometers at the sns complementary qens measurements are possible with the cold neutron chopper spectrometer cncs which will typically provide an energy resolution between and ev  microalgae dewatering is major obstruction to industrial scale processing of microalgae for biofuel production the dilute nature of harvested microalgal cultures creates huge operational cost during dewatering thereby rendering algae based fuels less economically attractive currently there is no superior method of dewatering microalgae technique that may result in greater algal biomass may have drawbacks such as high capital cost or high energy consumption the choice of which harvesting technique to apply will depend on the species of microalgae and the final product desired algal properties such as large cell size and the capability of the microalgae to autoflocculate can simplify the dewatering process this article reviews and addresses the various technologies currently used for dewatering microalgal cultures along with comparative study of the performances of the different technologies sustainability and environmental concerns are major issues in the world today it is now widely accepted necessity to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from human activities contributing to the green house effect and thus global warming transportation energy consumes about of worldwide primary energy thus it is clear that reduction in transportation and general engine based emissions can play significant role in the mitigation of green house gas emissions biofuel as an alternative to petroleum transport fuels has become essential to the reduction of global warming caused by fossil fueled engines the renewable and nontoxic properties of biofuel make it very promising alternative fuel the production and use of biofuels contribute close to zero net carbon dioxide and sulfur into the atmosphere and emit fewer gaseous pollutants than petroleum fuels the use of microalgae as source of biofuel production has gained enormous research interests microalgae are able to photosynthetically convert carbon dioxide into potential biofuel feedstocks as well as food feeds and high value bioactives microalgal crops unlike other oil crops are able to grow extremely fast and can double their biomass within period of microalgae grow throughout the year and can be harvested continuously on insignificant land in arid regions of the world while making use of water that is not suitable for conventional agriculture unlike other sources of biofuel the demand for large area of land is greatly reduced in the case of microalgae this is proven by the fact that only between and of the total s crop area would be required to produce algal biomass that would satisfy of s transport needs although studies have found that microalgae have definite advantages over conventional biofuel sources broad commercialization of microalgae sourced biofuel has been restrained due to high costs of operation during processing particular aspect of the process that involves high operational costs is the harvesting and dewatering steps and this is mainly due to the dilute nature of microalgal cultures these steps require substantial energy input and thus inflict high operational costs to the overall process thus the unit operation of harvesting and dewatering is major factor to be considered if viable economics of algae based fuels is desired this would require the use of efficient and versatile dewatering technologies with high productivity and recovery under optimum economy microalgal harvesting is performed extensively in water treatment and biofuel production the purpose for microalgal harvesting in biofuel production differs from that in water treatment the removal of undesirable microalgae in the water treatment industry involves progressive reduction in both microalgal chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand to values below their discharge limits for example in biodiesel production microalgae need to be concentrated as much as possible to simplify the lipid extraction step that follows increased product concentration decreases the cost of extraction and purification as well as the effective unit cost of the raw biomass although the objectives are different the harvesting techniques involved are comparable the main dissimilarity is that for biodiesel production the microalgae biomass is required for further processing therefore the dewatering method used must not contaminate or be toxic to the system as it may be desirable to recycle the water medium microalgal harvesting involves the concentration of dilute microalgal suspensions typically total suspended solids tss into slurry or paste with concentrations of tss or more depending on the target process objective from fig it can be seen that it is possible to obtain the desired microalgal concentration by one or two step harvesting process which involves primary harvesting step that forms slurry of tss followed by secondary dewatering step that produces an algal paste of tss the concentration obtained in the harvesting steps is crucial to the overall process as it influences the subsequent drying process microalgae can generally be considered as particles whose stability is due to surface charge which is electronegative for ph of steric effects due to water molecules bound to the microalgal surface and adsorbed macromolecules or extracellular organic matter when compared to other particles in suspension microalgae have the disadvantage that it is composed of several species with different characteristics such as size shape and motility that can influence their behavior toward treatment this makes it difficult to name one single technique as the best for microalgal recovery several techniques for the dewatering of microalgal cultures have been developed these techniques rely on properties that simplify the harvesting and recovery process the properties include large cell size high specific gravity compared to the medium and reliable autoflocculation or induced flocculation the major techniques currently employed in microalgae harvesting and recovery include centrifugation flocculation filtration and screening gravity sedimentation flotation and electrophoresis techniques these are reviewed in this article along with comparative study of their performances the performance of each dewatering technique can be quantitatively evaluated by the following factors the rate of water removal productivity of dewatering technique the solid content of the recovered microalgae water slurry and the efficiency yield of the dewatering technique recovered microalgae as percentage of total processed microalgae the main methods of measuring the amount of algae removed include absorbance turbidity and concentration measurements of the resulting microalgae water slurry centrifugation is separation process that uses centrifugal forces to separate solids and liquids the separation is based on the particle size and density difference of the medium components the behavior of the smallest particles in the system has the largest effect on separation efficiency study conducted by moraine et al found that high speed centrifugation was reliably effective recovery technique for microalgae laboratory centrifugation tests were carried out on pond effluent at g and showed that could be clarified and recovered in min although centrifugation is an effective method of microalgal recovery the main disadvantage is the high investment and operating costs required heasman et al investigated the extent of cell recovery for three different centrifugation conditions for ten microalgal species two forms of high speed centrifugation were used with acceleration factors of and the third type of centrifuge was slower laboratory style bucket centrifuge that had an applied centrifugation acceleration factor of the results showed that cell recovery was obtained with centrifugation at the efficiency of recovery decreased with decreasing acceleration recovery was achieved for centrifugation at and recovery for centrifugation at centrifugal recovery was evaluated in review by grima et al this review compared different applications of centrifugation for the harvesting of microalgae and concluded that although centrifugal recovery is energy intensive it is rapid and preferred method for microalgal cell recovery cell viability was found to be significantly dependent on the microalgal species and the method of centrifugation the work of knuckey et al states that although centrifugation is successful dewatering method the exposure of microalgal cells to high gravitational and shear forces can damage cell structure also the processing of large volumes of culture could be time consuming and costly flocculation is the process where solute particle in solution forms an aggregate called floc flocculation occurs when the solute particles collide and adhere to each other chemicals called flocculants are usually added to induce flocculation most microalgal cells have size range between and microalgal cells can form stable suspensions with chemically reactive cellular surface that has net negative surface charge due to the ionization of functional groups the stability of these microalgal suspensions is dependant on the forces that interact between the particles themselves and the particles and water the harvesting of microalgal cells by flocculation is seen to be superior method to conventional harvesting methods such as centrifugation and floatation because it allows the treatment of large quantities of microalgal culture as well as being able to be applied to wide range of species although flocculation has proven to be successful for concentrating microalgae the method alone may not be sufficient moraine et al indicated that microalgal flocs have specific gravity close to and even below that of water when exposed to light releasing photosynthetic oxygen this means that sedimentation of microalgal flocs may not be possible and methods combining flocculation with other techniques such as flocculation flotation and flocculation centrifugation may need to be looked into there are two main types of flocculants inorganic flocculants and organic polymer polyelectrolyte flocculants many different chemicals have been tested for microalgal flocculation and the most effective method was found to be aluminum sulfate and certain cationic polymers such as praestol cationic polyacrlyamides zetag and zetag and cationic polyamines there have also been studies on the use of microbial flocculants oh et al looked at the use of microbial flocculant am for harvesting mass cultured chlorella vulgaris this flocculant was able to obtain flocculation efficiency which can be defined as the recovery of algal biomass of in the ph range of which is considerably higher than that of aluminum sulfate and cationic polymer polyacrylamide polyelectrolyte polyelectrolyte flocculants are described as polymeric flocculants that include ionic and non ionic species natural and synthetic polymers the mechanism of microalgal flocculation by polymer flocculants can be explained by combination of charge neutralization and particle bridging the extent of each depending on the charge density and chain length of the polymer this involves the attachment of the polymer molecule on the microalgal surface by electrostatic or chemical forces the polymer is able to adsorb onto the surface of the microalgae due to one or combination of coulombic charge charge interactions dipole dipole interactions hydrogen bonding or van der waals interactions the polymer can stick to certain points on the microalgal surface but have its tail trail out into the solvent this results in polymer segments attached to the microalgal surface as trains separated from one another by loops that extend into the solution and end in tail it is possible for the loops and tails of the polymer to attach to similar parts of polymers and form bridges resulting in three dimensional matrix the extent of microalgal flocculation is determined by the degree of coverage of the microalgal surface by the polymer if less than the optimum amount is covered by the polymer it will result in inadequate bridging which may not be able to withstand shear forces due to any agitation if there is too much coverage by the polymer it can cause electrostatic or static hindering of bridging polymeric flocculants can either be cationic anionic or nonionic in shelef et al conducted review on microalgae harvesting and processing techniques polymeric flocculants reviewed by shelef et al are listed in table with optimal dose and ph values the review outlined number of factors that could affect polymeric flocculation it was found that increasing the molecular weight of the polymeric flocculant would lead to lower optimal dose required the concentration of hydrogen ions ph and the medium electrolyte concentration can affect the degree of ionization charge density and the extension of the polymer the surface charge density of the microalgal surface and even the whole flocculation process the effect of ph was also demonstrated in study by tenney et al who found that the most effective flocculation with cationic polyelectrolytes was achieved at low ph levels this is because at low ph levels there is reduced electrostatic repulsion between colloids and this leads to greater chance of polymer bridging due to the expansion of the polymer chains the concentration of microalgae can vary the microalgal surface area which will determine the dose of polymeric flocculant required the chemical composition of the microalgal suspension can also affect the flocculation process the presence of certain chemicals can affect the dose of flocculant required and also the optimum ph another influential factor is the size of the flocs formed during flocculation as the density of microalgae is close to that of water flocculation can lead to the formation of flocs with low densities especially when the concentration of the flocculant is low therefore to achieve effective sedimentation floc sizes in excess of are required the addition of high molecular weight bridging polymers can further increase floc size and lead to an improvement in microalgal settling since charge neutralization is the basis for microalgal flocculation the charge of the polyelectrolytes is very important factor that affects the microalgae flocculation due to the negatively charged microalgae surface anionic polyelectrolytes do not exert much influence if used as the sole flocculant early studies conducted on anionic and nonionic polyelectrolytes did not achieve successful microalgal flocculation the inability of flocculation with anionic polyelectrolytes can be explained by repulsion between like charges or by polymer segments being unable to bridge between particles due to insufficient length the lower the molecular weight the more difficult it is for polyelectrolytes to be adsorbed this means that larger amounts of polyelectrolytes are required even though no flocculation was observed with the anionic flocculant it was confirmed that the anionic polymer did attach to the microalgal surface due to particle particle bridging mechanism or an increase in negative microelectrophoretic mobility research has found that cationic polyelectrolytes are the most effective flocculants for microalgae recovery tenney et al looked into the flocculation of fresh water microalgae using synthetic organic polyelectrolytes using the standard jar test the extent of microalgal flocculation was determined by measuring the turbidity of the suspension after of settling cationic polyelectrolyte polyamine was found to flocculate the algae successfully at an optimum dose of mg the dosage of positively charged flocculant is dependent on the amount of negative charge in the dispersed system the surface charge density the total cell surface area the cell counts per volume and the charge density of the cationic flocculant bernhardt et al stated that functional groups on microalgal cell walls are important because they induce the formation of negative charge centers on the cell surfaces the functional groups are mostly carboxyl groups and these influence the isoelectric point of the microalgae cells in the aqueous medium the concentration and reactivity of these functional groups can vary with growth phase and metabolic conditions of the microalgae this variation directly affects the negative charge density of the microalgae and therefore influences the adsorption of organic polyelectrolytes or inorganic iron and aluminum hydroxo complex flocculants early studies on algal flocculation have shown that microalgae can be successfully flocculated when their surface charges are neutralized charge neutralization refers to state where the net electrical charge of the microalgal particle has been cancelled due to adsorption of an equal amount of the opposite charge the mechanism of microalgal flocculation with inorganic flocculants is charge neutralization provided the microalgae are small and approximately spherical in order for microalgae to be flocculated by inorganic flocculants the ph needs to be low enough to form cationic hydrolysis products shelef et al conducted detailed review on inorganic flocculants the optimal dose and ph of certain inorganic flocculants can be viewed in table inorganic flocculants are able to form polyhydroxy complexes at an appropriate ph the inorganic flocculants reviewed by shelef et al were alum al so o ferric sulfate and lime the sources of data were from flocculation experiments using jar tests batch flocculation experiments or using pilot scale apparatus it was found that alum displayed superior flocculating ability compared to ferric sulfate in terms of the optimal dose of flocculant ph and quality of water slurry obtained lime was found to have good flocculation ability but the flocculant could only be used for microalgal cultures that had magnesium concentrations above mg the sludge formed from the flocculation process also contained greater amount of lime than microalgae study by ayoub et al also observed that lime treatment used to induce flocculation in microalgal suspensions was more effective if the original suspension already contained magnesium or calcium ions ph induced microalgal flocculation was studied with the addition of sea water into the medium and results showed that the presence of sea water significantly increased microalgal cell removal it is believed that the calcium carbonate flocs have negative charge while the magnesium hydroxide flocs have positive charge since microalgal cells have negative charge the magnesium hydroxide flocs are responsible for the majority of cell removal due to charge destabilization in the water treatment industry alkalizing agents such as lime or sodium hydroxide have been used to raise the ph levels required to embark on chemical flocculation in microalgae studies have found that the use of alkalizing agents successfully results in microalgae flocculation due to the precipitation of calcium and magnesium hydroxides the combined flocculation process is multistep flocculation process using more than one type of flocculant the combined flocculation process was studied by sukenik et al two approaches were studied the use of both organic polymer and inorganic flocculants and the treatment of microalgal cultures with oxidants preceding the flocculation process the sequential addition of chitosan polymeric and alum or ferric chloride inorganic flocculants showed to improve the overall degree of flocculation as well as reduce the dosage of inorganic flocculant required although at high ionic strengths chitosan was found to be unable to bridge between microalgal particles it is assumed to adsorb to the microalgal cell surface and reduce the charge predisposing the microalgal cells to flocculation by the inorganic flocculant thus reducing the dose autoflocculation is the spontaneous floc formation and settling of microalgae this type of flocculation is associated with an increase in ph due to photosynthetic carbon dioxide consumption and the precipitation of inorganic precipitates it is proposed that aside the precipitation of inorganics the formation of microalgal aggregates can be explained by excreted organic macromolecules inhibited release of microalgae daughter cells and aggregation between microalgae and bacteria sukenik and shelef investigated autoflocculation in outdoor ponds and also in the laboratory in the outdoor pond experiments the microalgal species sc dimorphus was grown autotrophically for days at constant ph of by the addition of carbon dioxide on the eighth day the pond agitation and carbon dioxide supply were stopped autoflocculation proceeded with an increase in ph due to continued carbon dioxide consumption by the photosynthetic activity of the culture it was observed that the microalgae aggregated into flocs and settled at the bottom of the pond the laboratory experiments also found that autoflocculation could be simulated by changing the alkaline conditions to that required for autoflocculation the mechanism for autoflocculation is the supersaturation state of the culture medium with respect to calcium and phosphate ions due to the increase in ph this supersaturation causes initial nucleation of calcium phosphate precipitation that is promoted by the microalgal cells acting as the solid surface the calcium phosphate precipitate is positively charged in the presence of excess calcium ions and so is adsorbed and reacts with the negatively charged microalgal cells resulting in agglomeration the majority of work done on microalgae flocculation has been on freshwater species microalgae growth in high ionic strength marine environment has been studied over the years the effect of ionic strength on the flocculation using cationic polymers has been studied in general and also for use in microalgae bilanovic and shelef found that the high salinity of the marine environment inhibited flocculation with polyelectrolytes effective flocculation was attained at salinity levels lower than l the reduced effectiveness of cationic polymers to induce microalgae flocculation in sea and brackish waters is primarily attributed to the effect of medium ionic strength on the configuration and dimension of the polymer as indicated by changes in the intrinsic viscosity at high ionic strength the polymer shrinks to its smallest dimensions and fails to bridge between algal cells the possibility of flocculating marine microalgae species using inorganic flocculants ferric chloride and alum was studied by sukenik et al the optimal dosage required to flocculate marine microalgae was found to be of the order of five to ten times higher than that for freshwater microalgae the optimal dose for the two inorganic flocculants was also seen to increase significantly with an increase in the ionic strength of the media it is proposed that the high salinity of the marine microalgae species interferes with the flocculation process by reducing the chemical activity of the flocculant and masking functionally actives sites of the flocculants this method of separation utilizes permeable medium through which suspension is passed the permeable medium retains the solids and allows the liquid to pass through screening involves passing the suspension through screen with specific pore size the solid particles that are larger than the screen pore size are retained while the liquid phase passes through the screen microstrainers and vibrating screen filters are the two main types of screens used for microalgae harvesting microstrainers can be described as rotating filters with fine mesh screens and continual backwash the flow through rate of the filter determines how much culture medium is processed per microstrainer unit and is the key factor that determines the overall cost the flow through rate and cost of the unit is determined by the size of the screen openings the size of the screen opening will be dependent on the species of microalgae larger microalgal species will require larger openings resulting in faster flow rates and lower cost the concentration of microalgae is another factor that influences the efficiency of the process high microalgal concentration can result in blocking of the screen while low microalgal concentration can result in inefficient capture limitations with the use of microstrainers include incomplete solids removal and difficulty in handling solids fluctuations which may be overcome by varying the rotation speed filtration requires pressure drop to be applied across the system in order to force the fluid through the filter the extent of pressure required for the medium determines which type of driving force is used gravity vacuum pressure or centrifugal there are two main types of filtration surface filters where the solids are deposited on the filter medium in thin film or cake and depth filters deep bed filters where the solids are deposited within the filter medium one of the major problems associated with filtration is that media that are fine enough to retain the microalgae tend to bind and therefore require regular backwashes this results in decrease in the amount of microalgal concentrate grima et al conducted review on process options available for the recovery of microalgal biomass they found that filtration methods that operate under pressure or vacuum are suitable for recovering microalgal species with large cell size but inadequate to recover microalgal species with sizes approaching bacterial dimensions in the range of micrometers diatomaceous earth has been found to be an effective filtration medium for the recovery of small size species study was conducted on small celled microalgal species dunaliella using filtration through sand filters and cellulose fibers this method proved unsatisfactory and impractical with an exception to filtration through diatomaceous earth it was found that the microalgal species when grown in salt ponds could be recovered adequately by passing the culture medium through diatomaceous earth the microalgal biomass can then be recovered by scraping off thin layer of biomass from the filter aid tangential flow filtration or cross flow filtration is filtration system that has the potential to be very promising for the recovery of large volumes of microalgal culture in tangential flow filtration the medium flows tangentially across membrane the retentate is recirculated across the membrane keeping the cells in suspension and minimizing fouling particles with sizes smaller than the pores of the membrane are able to pass through while those larger in size are retained the type of membrane used in this process may be an ultrafiltration membrane or microporous membrane both available in wide range of pore sizes or molecular weight cutoffs as grima et al reported microfiltration and ultrafiltration are possible alternatives that could be used to recover microalgae the advantage of tangential flow filtration over other recovery techniques such as conventional filtration centrifugation flocculation and sedimentation is that better filtration rates can be achieved to completely remove debris and microalgal cells petrusevski et al conducted study on the suitability of tangential flow filtration for the recovery of microalgae the tangential flow filtration system included membrane with pore size of it was found that the system could successfully recover large volumes of microalgal culture with the overall microalgal biomass recovery being it was also found that the system was able to preserve the structure and properties such as motility and negative surface charge of the microalgal biomass tangential flow filtration can also be used for shear sensitive suspensions and is considered relatively cheap separation or concentration method when compared to the other recovery techniques the costs involved in this technique are related with pumping and membrane replacements large scale recovery of microalgae using this technique can be restricted due to continuous fouling and subsequent replacement of the membranes study conducted by rossignol et al looked at the use of polymer membranes for the continuous recovery of the marine microalgal species haslea ostrearia and skeletonema costatum it was found that these membranes had potential for use in microalgal recovery however the performance of these membranes depended on the hydrodynamic conditions concentration and properties of the microalgal culture these membranes can generally have relatively long operating life in appropriate conditions e low imposed transmembrane pressure and low cross flow velocity microfiltration membranes gave higher initial fluxes than the ultrafiltration membranes but they were inclined to clog more easily figure shows schematic diagram of tangential flow filtration system gravity gravity sedimentation is technique that separates feed suspension into concentrated slurry and clear liquid harvesting by sedimentation at natural gravity can be accomplished via lamella separators and sedimentation tanks lamella separators can offer an increased settling area compared to conventional thickeners due to the orientation of the plates the microalgal suspension is pumped continuously while the slurry is removed discontinuously the main form of energy required is that needed to pump the slurry flocculants can be added in order to increase the microalgal separation and the rate of sedimentation sedimentation tanks are not used widely in the industry but are reliable method to concentrate microalgal suspensions to tss the separation of microalgae by sedimentation tanks is an inexpensive process however without the addition of flocculants the reliability is low the density of microalgal particles play an important role in the success of solids removal by gravity settling calculations performed by edzwald show that microalgae particles with low density do not settle well and are poorly removed by settling flotation as method of removal of microalgae from aqueous solutions can be considered more advantageous and effective than sedimentation flotation can be described as physiochemical type of gravity separation in which air or gas is bubbled through solid liquid suspension and the gaseous molecules are attached to the solid particles these particles are carried to the surface of the liquid and accumulate as float which can be removed flotation is dependent on the instability of the suspended particle lower instability will correspond to higher air particle contact the size of the particles is important in flotation the smaller the particle size the more likely the particle can be levitated by the bubbles particle diameter of less than can be used for flotation another important parameter is the particle capture by the bubble the capturing process can be described as the product of two probabilities the probability of the collision between bubble and particle and the probability of adhesion of the bubble and the particle after collision has occurred it has been shown that there is decrease in the probability of collision with decreasing particle size there are three main flotation techniques that entail bubble generation these are dispersed air flotation dissolved air flotation and electrolytic flotation the first two are discussed in the following sections while the review of electrolytic flotation can be found under sec iii in electrophoresis techniques dissolved air flotation is the most widely used flotation technique applied in industrial effluent treatment the process of dissolved air flotation involves the reduction in pressure of water stream that is presaturated with air at pressures higher than atmospheric the liquid containing the dissolved air is then injected at atmospheric pressure into flotation tank through nozzles or needle valves this generates bubbles that rise through the liquid and carry the suspended solids to the surface which can then be skimmed off portion of the clarified liquid is separated and saturated with air to be recycled back into the flotation tank conventional dissolved air flotation unit is shown in fig the size of bubbles produced can range from to with mean of about the concentration of air and the diameter of the bubbles can affect the design and operation of the dissolved air flotation process the air supply can be controlled by changing the saturator pressure or the recycle ratio the size of the bubbles can be controlled by the saturator to achieve small bubble size the saturator pressure needs to operate above atmospheric pressure the injection flow rate also influences the size of the bubbles the injection flow rate must be large enough to provide pressure drop but also prevent backflow and bubble growth on the surface of the pipes increasing the pressure will lead to smaller bubble size the degree of microalgae removal e the effluent clarification is dependent on factors such as the recycle rate air tank pressure hydraulic retention time and particle floating rate the concentration of the slurry formed depends on the velocity of the skimmer and its height above the surface of the water microalgae separation by dissolved air flotation has often been combined with chemical flocculation and it is possible to obtain microalgal slurries of up to autoflotation of microalgae by photosynthetically produced dissolved oxygen was studied after flocculation with alum or polymer microalgal removal of was achieved with the microalgal float concentrations reaching values greater than however this method was limited to oxygen concentrations above mg a study carried out by edzwald looked into the removal of microalgae using dissolved air flotation compared to settling the results also showed that microalgae removal by dissolved air flotation required pretreatment by flocculation dissolved air flotation and settling experiments were conducted at identical conditions it was found that dissolved air flotation was more successful for microalgae removal the efficiency of each technique was evaluated from the turbidity of the sample the experiments showed that dissolved air flotation produced lower turbidities compared to settling fig dispersed air flotation involves the formation of bubbles by high speed mechanical agitator and an air injection system gas introduced at the top is mixed with liquid and allowed to pass through disperser which creates bubbles ranging from to in diameter dispersed air flotation study was performed by chen et al three types of surfactant were used as the collectors for microalgae removal nonionic cationic cetyl n trimethylammonium bromide and anionic sodium dodecylsulfate surfactants or collectors are used to prepare the surface of the algae particles for flotation by air bubbles or to encourage microalgae agglomeration they do this by changing the hydrophobicity of the particle which will affect the likelihood of microalgae bubble attachment experiments were conducted on the microalgal species scenedesmus quadricauda the results of the study showed that dispersed air flotation was successful for the removal of scenedesmus quadricauda from water the most effective collector was the cationic ctab the optimum ph range was it was proposed that the role of the collector ions is to increase the resistance of bubble rupture they may also migrate to the solid surface and increase the hydrophobicity of the solid particle which may lead to electrical interactions between the solid particles and the gas bubbles electrostatic interactions are thought to play crucial role in the efficiency of the collectors one of the major disadvantages of using chemicals such as flocculants to aid microalgae recovery is that it involves the addition of chemicals into the system which results in an increase in total dissolved solids there is also risk of potential contamination of the medium which is usually recycled to the bioreactor potential solution to this problem is to use electrolytic methods this is because microalgae are able to behave as colloid particles and can be separated from water based medium solutions by movement in an electric field the advantages of using electrochemical processes include environmental compatibility versatility energy efficiency safety selectivity and cost effectiveness three common electrophoresis techniques are reviewed including electrolytic coagulation electrolytic flotation and electrolytic flocculation electrolytic electrocoagulation involves the use of both chemical and physical mechanisms to separate microalgal mass from water based medium solutions reactive electrodes such as iron or aluminum are used these electrodes produce metal ions that induce coagulation of the microalgal mass and result in the removal of suspended solids the amount of metal dissolved to form ions is dependent on the amount of electricity that passes through the electrolytic solution this can be described by the following equation itmnf where is the amount of the electrode metal that is dissolved gram of cm is the current density cm is the time m is the relative molar mass of the metal electrode is the number of electrons in the oxidation reduction reaction and is the faraday constant mol if the potential applied is from an external power source the cathode material will undergo reduction and the anode oxidation the reactions occurring at the electrodes are as follows refers to the metal of the electrode at the anode s aq ne o h aq g at the cathode aq ne s o e g oh the process consists of three stages formation of coagulants due to the dissolution of the reactive anode electrode in the case of iron or aluminum the ions immediately hydrolyze to form polymeric iron or aluminum hydroxide destabilization of the particulate colloid suspension aggregation of the destabilized suspension and the formation of microalgal flocs this is achieved when the metal cations combine with the negatively charged microalgal cells that are carried toward the anode by electrophoretic motion aragon et al conducted study that compared the conventional microalgal recovery technique flocculation with electrolytic techniques the chemical flocculant used for the conventional tests was aluminum sulfate the experiment conducted was the typical jar test for the electrolytic experiments the electrodes used were made of aluminum with total active surface area of cm at periodic time intervals samples were taken from the bottom of the experimental vessel and the absorbance measured in order to determine the microalgal concentration the experiment was performed at various current intensities and potential differences the results showed that electrolysis was superior to flocculation this decision was based on the fact that electrolysis had lower cost the cost of energy was lower than the cost of flocculants shorter time for separation to occur and lower probability that the microalgal aggregate will be contaminated with metallic hydroxides also only small current strengths were needed which correspond to very low current densities it was also found that there was relationship between the potential difference applied and the time needed for electrolysis to occur in order to achieve certain level of microalgal separation azarian et al studied the effect of continuous flow electrocoagulation in the application of microalgae removal from industrial wastewater the experiments consisted of five aluminum electrodes in the shape of flat plates three anodes and two cathodes the choice of material was based on the fact that electrode dissolution would introduce flocculant into the process the results of the experiments conducted showed that the application of higher power inputs led to an increased microalgae removal rate an increase in power also resulted in decrease in the time required to achieve separation as well as an increase in the amount of flocculating agent produced however using higher power also resulted in an increase in temperature which may damage the process the change in ph was insignificant electrolytic electroflotation is similar to electrocoagulation where active metal anodes are used as flocculating agents however in electroflotation the cathode is made from an inactive metal electrochemically nondepositing that generates hydrogen bubbles from water electrolysis eq these bubbles adhere to the microalgal flocs and carry them to the surface alfafara et al investigated the electrolytic removal of microalgae in batch and continuous reactors by flotation the electrodes used in the experiments were polyvalent aluminum anode and titanium alloy cathode the results for the batch system showed that increasing the electrical power increased the rate of chlorophyll removal and decreased the electrolysis time the concentration of microalgae removed from electrolysis was directly proportional to the amount of chlorophyll measured limitation of using high electrical power was the increase in temperature observed although this temperature increase was not significant at lower electrical power values slight ph increase was also observed it was also found that the introduction of mixing into the system decreased the chlorophyll removal efficiency without mixing the generation of gas bubbles is enough to create turbulence at higher shear forces the gas bubbles that may be trapped in the microalgal flocs can disperse leading to the destruction of microalgal flocs it was observed that the intensity of natural mixing increased with power which can be explained by the increase in gas evolution due to the increase in power in the continuous system the experiments were conducted at different flow rates and electrical currents the concentration of chlorophyll in the influent and effluent were measured at steady state in comparison with the batch system the temperature and ph of the continuous system reached the steady state values it was found that the dilution effect of the water during the electrolysis process was good buffer against problems such as increases in temperature and ph the same relationships between electrical power time flocculant production and microalgal removal in the batch system were also found in the continuous system the disadvantages of electroflotation include scaling of the cathode and the high cost of power rectifiers sandbank and shelef conducted study on different microalgal recovery techniques such as flocculation dissolved air flotation flotation and electroflotation electroflotation was performed with stainless steel titanium dioxide electrodes which were orientated to cover the bottom of the unit it was found that electroflotation was not the best choice for microalgal recovery but it may be preferred for marine microalgal species electrolytic electrolytic flocculation does not involve the use of sacrificial electrodes hence no flocculants are required the principle of electrolytic flocculation is based on the movement of negatively charged microalgae toward the anode upon reaching the anode the microalgal particles lose their charge and are able to form aggregates this can be seen in fig which shows schematic diagram of an electrolytic flocculation unit electrolysis of water produces bubbles that can aid the microalgal flocs to rise to the surface study conducted by poleman et al investigated electrolytic flocculation of microalgae the experiments were carried out in l vessel with electrodes arranged vertically different setups were tested with varying distance between cathode and anode voltages and current densities the results showed that electrolytic flocculation was successful in removing microalgae from dilute suspensions having removed of microalgae in min decreasing the voltage led to slower microalgae removal rate but it had the advantage of consuming less energy decreasing the total surface area of the electrodes and increasing the distance between electrodes also consumed less energy the main advantages of this process are that there is no need for flocculants and that minimum energy is consumed by using the optimum potential difference electrode surface area and distance between electrodes disadvantage of this process is that the cathodes are prone to fouling fig large amount of studies has been completed on the harvesting and recovery techniques of microalgal cells in dilute suspensions due to the differences in the biology of microalgal species it is difficult to name one method as superior the choice of which harvesting technique to use depends on the species of microalgae and the final product desired desired microalgal properties that simplify harvesting are large cell size high specific gravity compared to the medium and reliable autoflocculation in addition to these the optimum harvesting method chosen for particular microalgal species should have minimum energy requirements and should be as economical as possible the main harvesting techniques are summarized in table ii centrifugation is seen as the most efficient recovery technique yet the energy and capital costs associated are unappealing flocculation is also very efficient technique that is currently applied in industries freshwater microalgae flocculation has been immensely studied throughout the years however there is dearth of information and comparative studies for marine microalgae with growing concern about freshwater resources in many parts of the world further research on the processing of marine microalgae would be very beneficial  graphene sheets that are now routinely obtained by the exfoliation reduction of graphite oxide exhibit raman spectra unlike traditional graphene systems the general attributes of the raman spectra of these wrinkled graphene are first reaffirmed by evaluating the spectra of samples prepared by seven different exfoliation reduction methods these graphene sheets exhibit highly broadened and raman bands and in addition have modulated bump in place of the conventional g band it is shown that the high wavenumber bump can be resolved into the conventional band and several defect activated peaks such as d and the broad band could also be deconvoluted into the actual band and the band thereby attributing the broadening in the band to the presence of this defect activated band two additional modes named as at cm and at cm could be identified these peculiar features in the raman spectrum of graphene are attributed to the highly disordered and wrinkled defective morphology of the sheets the affect of defects are further augmented due to the finite crystallite size of these graphene sheets the dispersion in the band positions and peak intensities with respect to the laser energy are also demonstrated the term graphene was coined by boehm et al in and was first used by mouras and co workers in to describe single layer in graphite intercalation compounds currently it is used to describe an isolated monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb like pattern though there were several attempts to grow graphene isolated single layer graphene slg could be extracted only in this discovery is credited to novoselov et al who showed that defect free graphene monolayer could be extracted albeit in small quantities by mechanical exfoliation of highly oriented graphite using scotch tape several unique phenomena such as quantum spin hall effect ballistic transport suppression of the weak localization deviation from the adiabatic born oppenheimer approximation and high charge carrier mobility have been observed some of the other strategies currently being used are chemical vapor deposition cvd or epitaxial growth of graphene on desired substrates or post synthesis transfer onto them intercalation exfoliation of graphite liquid phase exfoliation or direct conversion of graphite by different routes such as ultrasonication in various solvents etc have also been developed in seminal paper in schneipp et al showed that few layer graphene sheets can be obtained by thermal splitting of graphite oxide go the basic principle involved in this method is to increase the interlayer spacing of graphite by introducing functional groups and then removing these groups by providing rapid thermal gradient the thermal treatment liberates gases from go if the rate of evolution of gases is greater than that of diffusion of gases the pressure developed exfoliates and reduces the sheets to graphene else only reduction occurs these graphene sheets are wrinkled have high surface area and are electrically conducting subsequently several exfoliation reduction procedures have been developed for the synthesis of graphene from go these procedures can be classified as gasothermal solvothermal and photothermal methods based on the exfoliation reduction conditions the precursor go can be in solid powder form or dispersed in solvents the graphene products obtained from these procedures are wrinkled disordered to varying extents and have different oxygen contents these aspects affect their electronic properties significantly consequently these structures are not suitable for electronic applications but are suited for multitude of other applications several different nomenclatures exist for these structures in literature such as functionalized graphene sheets reduced graphene wrinkled graphene exfoliated graphene etc following the works of reich and thomson dresselhaus and group ferrari et al and many others the raman spectrum of graphite and slg is fairly well understood both theoretically and experimentally the spectra consist of three prominent characteristic peaks namely the band the band and the or band few less intense peaks called the d d g d etc are observed in some cases the presence or absence of these bands their relative shapes positions and intensity ratios provide distinguishable information regarding the sample being studied and therefore are fundamental in characterizing graphene however the raman spectra of the relatively newer systems such as wrinkled graphene reduced graphene etc have not been adequately addressed consequently there is lot of discrepancy in the literature over the raman spectra of graphenes obtained from go some reports show equally intense and bands with no band or highly broadened and low intense band in certain other reports the band is similar to that of turbostratic graphite in many reports the band is neither mentioned nor discussed overall the raman spectra of these graphene structures are significantly different from that of the traditional slg or even the perfectly stacked few layer graphene in the light of these observations systematic evaluation of the raman spectra of graphenes obtained from go is necessary hence in this article the general pattern of the raman spectra of graphene synthesized from go is first established for this purpose graphene sheets are synthesized by seven different existing techniques and their raman spectra are analyzed in detail subsequently the appearance of multiple defect activated bands their superposition the dispersion in band positions and intensities etc have been demonstrated in these systems for the first time the variations in the raman spectra with incident laser energy power and exposure time have also been discussed purified natural graphite sp purity was purchased from bay carbon usa this graphite was used for raman studies as well as for the synthesis of graphene all other reagents and chemicals were procured from sigma aldrich or alfa aesar usa graphite oxide go was prepared by hummers method as given in our earlier report briefly of graphite was added to ml of conc so under stirring in an ice bath nano and kmno were added slowly one after the other after the suspension reached room temperature ml of water was added this mixture was diluted to ml using warm water o was added until the solution turned bright yellow this suspension was filtered and the filter cake was washed with warm water repeatedly the residue was diluted using water and the resulting suspension was centrifuged the final product was dried under vacuum few layer graphene were synthesized by exfoliating go under different conditions thermal exfoliation was done by inserting quartz boat containing go into preheated furnace with ar atmosphere for the sample is named teg vacuum exfoliation was carried out by placing go in vacuum oven mbar and heating it to this sample is called veg hydrogen exfoliation was carried out by rapidly heating go to in the presence of hydrogen to give heg for chemical exfoliation ceg go was dispersed in water and vol hydrazine hydrate was added the solution was refluxed at

microwave oven laser exfoliated graphene leg was synthesized by exposing go to intense laser in the raman spectrometer itself nm nd yag sun exfoliation was done as reported in brief go powders were spread in petri dish and covered with watch glass using magnifying lens sunlight was concentrated on go powders this resulted in exfoliation at the spot the focused spot was then moved over the entire sample to exfoliate the entire sample this sample is named as seg freshly prepared day old samples were used for the synthesis of all the above types of graphene for comparison graphene like materials

fitting profiles were used lorentz function and pseudo voigt function in general fitting was better with lorentz function rather than pseudo voigt function graphite graphite can be broken down to graphene by several approaches the ideal slg can be obtained by micromechanical cleavage of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite structures intermediate to graphite and slgs can be obtained by different methods as outlined in the previous section the differences in the synthesis procedures can result in varied morphologies fig presents the morphology of different structures derived from graphite graphite has highly ordered and layered structure as shown in fig fig shows the morphology of ball milled graphite or nano graphite it consists of highly defective spherical particles which is direct consequence of ball milling the sample shown in fig has large ordered crystallites as well as smaller disordered materials such structures have been named as graphene nanoplatelets or multi layer graphene in literature on the other hand graphene sheets obtained from go by most of the methods have wrinkled fluffy and disordered morphology in the powder form fig shows the morphology of typical graphene obtained from go images of other graphene obtained can be seen in our earlier work these wrinkled graphenes are of main interest in the present work for completeness the raman spectrum of graphite is discussed first which can be understood in terms of the raman spectrum of slg brief overview of the raman spectrum of slg is presented in electronic supplementary information as the number of layers tends from slg towards that of crystalline graphite via ab bernal stacking the and bands evolve significantly numerous reports show that as the number of layers increase the intensity of the band increases significantly while that of the band decreases in addition the shape of the band has two peak profile rather than single lorentzian as in slg to reconfirm these aspects the raman spectrum of graphite was recorded at different laser energies as shown in fig the band is located at cm and is clearly more intense than the band in addition the band has two peak profile the intense band and low energy shoulder called the band fig left inset this splitting is understood to be due to the splitting of electron dispersion energies caused by the interaction between the neighbouring graphitic planes further the band position is supposed to be dispersive due to its double resonant origin however in the present work we found that the band is dispersive with variation of about cm ev but not the entire band the band position on the other hand varies from spot to spot depending on the number of layers and axis stacking order of the underlying sample the band has fwhm of cm and peak intensity ratio d ig the band appears as in slg only in defective disordered samples or at the edges any physical or chemical treatments which cause defects in pristine graphite will result in the appearance of the band in the present graphite sample the band intensity is negligibly small nevertheless the band shows dispersive behaviour at the rate of cm ev which is half of that of band the dispersive nature of and band can be inferred from right inset in fig it is important to note the band position depends on the number of layers and stacking order of the graphitic sample any modification of the graphitic surface is clearly identifiable via the band entire band in some cases in perfectly b stacked few layer graphene by about layers the peak starts exhibiting two peak profile from top down point of view this indicates that the band in graphite maintains two peak profile down to or layers however in samples with high axis disorder the two peak profile of graphite is not maintained cancado et al have shown that as disorder increases the shoulder shift upwards and finally merges into the band as result the band exhibits single peak profile this does not indicate the formation of two dimensional graphene but rather the onset of turbostraticity and the loss of three dimensional ordering for the sample to be identified as slg along with the single peak nature of band its intensity must be higher than that of the band wrinkled as discussed earlier common route for the synthesis of graphene from graphite is based on exfoliation reduction of go in this work seven different established exfoliation reduction techniques have been adopted the graphene structures obtained by these methods are collectively named as few layer wrinkled graphene flwg for further discussions the flwgs have been characterized by different techniques the details are given in the electronic supplementary information figs and show the morphology of two flwgs as observed using tem the sheet like nature of flwgs is clearly visible from the tem images however the graphene sheets are highly disordered and contain large amount of corrugations or wrinkles on their surface these wrinkles are not point defects but are extended surface defects formed due to the folding or twisting of the few layer graphene sheets these wrinkles can cause deviation from the sp planar character expected for graphene furthermore since these wrinkles are randomly distributed on the surface the inter defect ld distance is not constant in these samples in comparison in the fesem images shown in fig figs and the graphene sheets appear to be arranged in random and disordered three dimensional porous architecture this difference of appearance in the powder form fesem and dispersed form tem is fundamental to graphene sheets synthesized from go this behavior is unique only to wrinkled graphene and no other carbon nanostructure the tem morphology nevertheless confirms that these materials are graphene like materials and not amorphous carbons the raman spectra elaser nm of go and the seven different flwgs are presented in fig it is to be noted that these raman spectra are for the poweder samples go has intense and bands and flat region the band is more intense than the band id ig the flwgs obtained by the exfoliation reduction of go consist of partially healed carbon basal planes due to the removal of functional groups hence their raman spectra is different from that of go the raman spectra of the flwgs have similar pattern but are unlike those of the traditional graphene systems the flwgs exhibit an intense band at cm and an equally intense band at cm in addition these bands are highly broadened with average fwhm of cm and cm respectively resulting in their overlap while the broadening in band can be due to the disorder defects in the samples the broadening in the band is unusual furthermore at the far wave number side represented as the or region to cm only modulated bump can be seen this is sharp contrast to the bands in traditional graphene and even graphite the traditional slg exhibits narrow single peak whereas graphite has broader two peak profile based on the earlier discussions on the band single low intense peak is expected in flwgs since they have layers and are also highly disordered along the axis but only bump like region is seen in the high wavenumber region further the shape of the modulated bump seems to vary between graphene samples some samples show broad single peak while others show distinguishable peaks this variation could be due to variation in amount of remnant functional groups or due to defects though interesting the minor variations seen in the shape of the band due to different synthesis conditions is not the scope of the work rather it is the general shape of the band itself that is focus of the work as can be seen from fig the band of flwgs is different from the conventional band of slg also the and bands are highly broadened and equally intense which is not seen in slg these aspects are explored in detail in this work effects of physical and chemical induced the unusual powder raman spectra of flwgs is probably direct consequence of its disordered and wrinkled defective morphology recently ferreira et al have shown that at high point defect densities in slg or few layer graphene introduced by ar bombardment at ar cm the band reduces in intensity considerably and at defect densities ar cm the band is replaced by modulated bump this behavior has been attributed to two competing mechanisms wherein the increase of defect first increases the intensity of the defect activated bands at high defect concentration the hexagonal network of graphene is disturbed which causes the suppression of the band on similar lines we found that defects can have significant impact on the shape of the band of graphite fig shows the raman spectra of nano graphite ngr which is obtained by ball milling of large graphite flakes for different durations the ball milling procedure breaks the large crystallites into smaller particles and also introduces significant amount of defects as can be seen from fig the band changes from two peak profile to single peak after ball milling for after the band is suppressed and bump like region emerges similar to that observed in flwgs since no chemical treatments were given the peculiar band shape cannot be due to functional groups and must be due to defects this shows that physical defects can cause the emergence of the bump even in graphite hence it can be said that the modulated band in flwgs is mainly due to defects chemically induced defects can also affect the band for instance go which is chemically converted form of graphite shows no peaks in the region at all fig since it is and highly defective structure consisting of functional groups intercalated between the graphitic layers when go is exfoliated or reduced to flwgs the region appears as shown in fig however if flwgs are treated with concentrated acid the band gets suppressed as seen be seen in fig this treatment causes severe defects to the graphene sheets thereby increasing the defects the damaged morphology of these two samples can be seen in fesem figures in the supplementary file as consequence of the increase in defects the band intensity also increases id ig for heg and for go in another set of experiments the amount of defects in graphene sheets is controlled by varying the reduction time in chemical exfoliation method fig shows the raman spectra of ceg synthesized by varying the reduction time ceg and ceg the parent go has flat region as seen in fig upon exfoliation and reduction the region appears with increase in reduction time the band intensity increases and the region is further suppressed these two examples show that the increase of chemically induced defects beyond particular amount can also suppress the band it is important to record the raman spectra of go at very low laser intensity at high laser intensities local in situ exfoliation reduction can occur causing the raman spectra of go to be similar to that of flwgs the raman spectrum of leg is shown in fig to assert this fact this may lead to wrong interpretation of raman spectra of go based on the above discussions it can be argued that the surface defects in the form of wrinkles in as synthesized flwgs can cause the suppression of the band the large amount of defects and disorder can also cause the emergence of many defect activated bands these band may merge due to broadening effectively giving bump like shape for the band defect in order to finally prove the influence of defects the presence of the defect activated peaks in the raman spectra of flwgs must be established hence attempts were made to deconvolute the region into its possible constituent peaks fig shows multiple lorentzians peak fit for the region in veg typical flwg four lorentzians could be fit successfully the peak positions are and cm based on the literature on the raman spectra of slgs the first two signals at cm and cm can be assigned to and g raman modes respectively without any ambiguity the band at cm has been assigned to d mode in some articles whereas some other reports assign this peak to the g mode similarly the peak at cm has been assigned to and d irrespective of the nomenclature all these bands broaden to large extent in flwgs effectively resulting in the bump like region d and g are both defect activated and hence will be present only in samples with sufficient defects is not defect activated because of momentum conservation restrictions the band is present even in graphite fig but has very low intensity the combination modes described above involve band this band is not generally seen in flwgs which is probably due to the broadening of the band hence deconvolution of the and bands was carried out as shown in fig total of five peaks could be fit as shown the peaks centered at cm and cm corresponds to the conventional and bands the broadening in the band at the higher wavenumber side is due to the presence of the band at cm the occurrence of this peak in flwgs has not been demonstrated earlier however this is not surprising since flwgs are highly defective structures and hence the bands can exist interestingly two additional peaks could be fit at cm and cm these bands are named as and respectively the origin of these bands in flwgs is not clear it should be noted however that these peaks have been found in disordered carbons some reports have attributed the peak to sp rich phase of disordered amorphous carbons the peak can be due to contributions from the phonon density of states in finite size graphitic crystals or due to h vibrations in hydrogenated carbons however ferrari and robertson have argued that these two peaks are the sum and difference of c stretching and ch wagging modes of trans polyacetylene alternating chain of sp carbons with single hydrogen bonded to carbon in nanocrystalline diamond and not due to sp carbons interestingly these two peaks could also be identified in the raman spectrum of nano graphite ngr which was obtained by ball milling of large graphite flakes this suggest that these bands in flwgs may not due to remnant functional groups or sp carbons but rather due to finite size of crystallites and consequent increase in defects further studies are required to ascertain the origin of these peaks the different bands in flwgs exhibit dispersion in their positions e the position varies with laser energy three lasers were used for this study viz nm ev nm ev and nm ev fig presents the dispersion behavior of the various bands in gasothermally exfoliated graphene namely teg heg and veg it was observed that the band position in teg heg and veg shifts towards higher wave numbers at and cm ev respectively the band which is the second order of the band shows blue shift at almost double the rate of the band as expected the dispersion factor for the band in teg heg and veg are and cm ev respectively surprisingly the band shows an unusual dispersion at the rate of and cm ev in teg heg and veg respectively this is unexpected since the band is generally invariant this apparent contradiction can be resolved by attributing the dispersion to the band for g in heg the band positions determined by deconvolution of the and bands are cm cm and cm under and ev laser respectively this gives dispersion factor sd cm ev however the actual band band also shows low dispersion of sg cm ev ni et al have recently shown that the band in twisted bilayer graphene can become double resonant since flwgs contain sheets that are twisted and folded as seen in the fesem micrographs the actual band may become double resonant direct consequence of the double resonance process is dispersion in band positions this can explain the dispersion observed in the actual band further theoretical and experimental proof is required to validate this and is beyond the scope of this work as result of the dispersion in the and bands the resultant peak also shows dispersion the dispersion in band can be obtained by linear combination of the dispersions in the constituent bands e sg sd sg if we use and an sg of cm ev is obtained which matches with the observed value the dispersion for the combination mode at cm was found to be d cm ev which is nearly equal to sd the d or g mode in heg exhibits dispersion of cm ev however this cannot be expressed as the sum of the dispersion in the constituent peaks since for this peak there is no backscattering restriction the peak intensities of the different bands in flwgs also show dispersion behaviour fig shows the raman spectra of heg under three different laser energies clearly the band increases in intensity with respect to the band with increasing wavelength or decreasing energy of the laser similarly the band intensity increases with respect to d band upon increase in wavelength the dispersion behaviour has been plotted in fig similar behaviour is observed in teg and veg also by comparing the dispersion relations in band positions and intensity the evolution of shape of the higher wave number bump with energy can be understood with increasing laser energy or decreasing wavelength the d band blue shifts the band blue shifts at almost triple the rate eventually causing the merging of the two peaks the band also decreases in intensity with laser energy thus the modulated bump observed under ev merge into single broad peak under ev laser finally it must be noted that the spectra of flwgs does not vary significantly from spot to spot as long as the reduction exfoliation is complete the time of exposure to laser and its power does not alter their raman spectra within the limit of our measurements at higher powers however damage to the sample could be observed under the microscope and in the spectra as well also the number of layers in flwgs samples may affect their raman spectra in the present work since the number of layers in flwgs is or more the layer number may not have significant effect on the band further work is necessary to evaluate the effect of layers the complexity of the raman spectra of wrinkled graphene sheets obtained by reduction exfoliation of go has been demonstrated the presence of wrinkles or surface defects results in the activation of multiple defect activated peaks these peaks broaden and merge due to the large amount of defects thereby giving rise to the modulated band in wrinkled graphene the large amount of defects also cause the emergence of new modes and which cause the broadening of and bands the dispersion in band position and intensity ratio has also been demonstrated in the case of wrinkled graphene  separation of colorectal cancer cells from other biological materials is important for stool based diagnosis of colorectal cancer in this paper we use conventional dielectrophoresis in microfluidic chip to manipulate and isolate hct colorectal cancer cells it is noticed that at particular alternating current frequency band the hct cells are clearly deflected to side channel from the main channel after the electric activation of an electrode pair this motion caused by negative dielectrophoresis can be used to simply and rapidly separate cancer cells from other cells in this manuscript we report the chip design flow conditions dielectrophoretic spectrum of the cancer cells and the enrichment factor of the colorectal cancer cells from other cells in the united states colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death with approximately new cases and deaths year often if the preinvasive form of the disease can be detected early it can be cured and cancer spread can be prevented separation of colorectal cancer cells from other biological materials is very important to improving the accuracy and cost effectiveness of cancer diagnosis although there are some cell separation methods microfluidic based cell separation could be new alternative to efficiently isolate colorectal cancer cells with high specificity at low cost compact microfluidic systems that can be used to manipulate and separate biological particles are of wide interest in biodefense and clinical diagnostic applications and have attracted much attention recently it is critical component in biochemistry molecular biology and synthesis protocols microfluidic systems are expected to have major impacts on biomedical research clinical diagnosis point of care food pathogen screening environmental testing and other endeavors by providing automated portable solutions to wide range of fluid based problems there are several methods to manipulate biological and nonbiological particles in microfluidic platform these include for instance optophoresis magnetic acoustics and dielectrophoresis dep among them dep has emerged as promising method for variety of engineering applications involving manipulation of micro and nanoparticles the advantages it can offer include label free detection easy operation and high specificity dep has been used for the separation of prepared mixtures of micro organisms mammalian cells and natural biological samples compared to devices that use other electrokinetic approaches to move particles such as electrophoresis or electro osmosis dep systems operate using low alternating current ac voltage instead of high direct current dc voltage and can easily be combined with electronic detection technologies g resistive and or capacitive sensing to generate fully electronic laboratory on chip dep is phenomenon in which force is exerted on dielectric particle when it is subjected to nonuniform ac electric field dep force does not require the particle to be charged this is due to the fact that when an electric field is applied to systems consisting of particles suspended in liquid dipole moment is induced on the particles due to the electrical polarizations at the interface between the particle and the suspending liquid if the field is nonuniform the particles experience translational force dep force of magnitude and polarity depending not only on the electrical properties of the particles and the medium but also on the magnitude and frequency of the applied electric field the polarizability of living cells depends strongly on their composition morphology and phenotype and is also highly dependent on the frequency of the applied electrical field this means that for given particle type and suspending medium the particle can experience at certain ac frequency applied to the electrodes translational force directed toward regions of high electric field strength this phenomenon is called positive dep e pdep alternatively by simply changing the frequency they may experience force that will direct the particle away from the high electric field strength regions this phenomenon is called negative dep e ndep dep has been demonstrated for manipulation of biological particles such as cells bacteria viruses yeast cerevisiae and even breast cancer cells the applicability of this technology to colorectal cancer cell separation has to our knowledge never been reported in this paper we report dep based cell sorter capable of continuous cancer cell isolation from other cells the present device is developed in microfluidic based format which would facilitate ease of integration with current and next generation laboratory on chip system and biodetection platforms figure gives schematic representation of dep forces acting on two different kinds of particles in nonuniform electric field the red particle is more polarizable than the surrounding medium and is attracted toward the strong field at the center of the electrode while the blue particle of low polarizability on the right is directed away from the strong field region charges in the particle itself are not necessary for the effect of dep to occur this is due to the fact that when an electric field is applied to system consisting of particles suspended in liquid dipole moment is induced due to the electrical polarizations at the interface between the particle and the suspending liquid for homogeneous sphere of radius the time averaged dep force in an ac electric field can be expressed as dep m re e rms where is the surrounding media dielectric constant and is the clausius mossotti factor rms is the root mean square value of the electric field the clausius mossotti factor can be expressed in terms of complex permittivities p p j where is the dielectric constant denotes the electrical conductivity is the field frequency and is the imaginary number the subscript refers to the particles suspended in medium and represents the medium indicated by these equations the dep force mainly depends on sphere radius its complex dielectric constant surrounding medium dielectric constant and the electric field rms based on this we could predict when we apply constant electric field constant rms on constant media with constant that the particles with different or in this medium will experience different dep forces at the same time consequently selective separation can be achieved by applying an additional force such as gravity or hydrodynamic force by fluid flow based on the aforementioned concept we have designed dep colorectal cancer cell separation system as shown in fig in this design there are two electrodes at the bottom surfaces of the microchannel the electrode pair is in parallel and has angle to the streamwise direction in the main channel ac electric signals are applied to the two electrodes having phase shift of at one side of the main channel near the electrode gap side channel is placed for carrying the migratory target particles that experience larger dep force for separation from the other particles in the main channel the operational principle is as follows as the target particles approach the gap between the electrode pair they experience strong negative dep which repels them against the hydrodynamic force in the direction to the flow direction in the main channel the hydrodynamic force is obtained from the stokes equation as h a the net force of dep fdep and hydrodynamic force fh push the target particles e colorectal cells to the side channel while other particles e bioparticles and here will keep their motion to the end of the main channel by the hydrodynamic force fh and fh brief structure description of the microfluidic dep sorter is shown in fig the separation chip was made using plastic lamination based microfabrication the benefits of using lamination techniques to build complex three dimensional devices include the use of variety of inexpensive high quality and biocompatible materials that easily accommodate the incorporation of other planar structures two transparent acrylic plastic substrates of mm were used as top cap and bottom layers respectively one inlet and two outlet wells one for the main channel and the other for the side channel are drilled on the top layer the diameter of all the wells is in main and side channels are formed on middle layer with the same height of but different widths of mm and respectively pair of indium tin oxide ito thin film electrodes is placed at the bottom of the channel with gap of the transparent ito is in thickness and consists of indium iii oxide in tin iv oxide sno typically in and sno by weight we use pressure sensitive adhesive to bind these layers together the chip is optically transparent to ensure the visualization of the cell motion figure shows the actual microfluidic dep sorter we have fabricated the sorter lies beside standard aa battery on the test bed of microscope tubings are used to connect the inlet of the chip to syringe pump and the other two outlets to reservoirs respectively two cuprum electrodes have been used to connect the ito electrodes inside the dep sorter for applying electric signal on both of them the human colorectal cancer cell line htc was used for the experiments for the clinical application usually it is more challenging to separate the colon cancer cells from normal epithelial cells it is also important to be able to separate cancer cells from bacteria to purify the target sample furthermore dep force depends on particle size and its dielectric property and separation of the same size but different dielectric properties could often be more challenging for these reasons we tested our system by mixing htc colon cancer cells with human embryonic kidney cells hek and escherichia coli coli bacterium both hct cells and hek cells have almost the same diameter of about it is difficult to discriminate between the hct cells and hek cells under microscope to be able to distinguish cells with visualization under the microscope we labeled the kidney cells with dye hoechst the coli cells are typically rod shaped and are about long and in diameter and are much smaller than hct cells then these three kinds of cells were mixed in phosphate buffered saline pbs buffer pbs solution teknova inc and the medium conductivity was cm schematic of the setup used for the dep separation is shown in fig the microchip was placed on the test bed of an inverted epifluorescent microscope olympus ix function generator tektronix model afg was used to supply ac electrical signal to these two ito electrodes objective lens numerical aperture of was used for the imaging the light was captured by high resolution charge coupled device ccd camera sensicam qe cooke corp with adapter harvard phd syringe pump was used to deliver the sample to the chip as shown in fig there are two ito electrodes at the bottom of the microchannel the two electrodes are parallel and the angle between the flow direction in the main channel horizontal line and the electrode is the electric signals applied to the electrodes have phase shift of side channel is placed near the electrode gap for separating and isolating the cancer cells that experience larger ndep force the main and side channels of the chip are designed to have flow rate ratio of this ensures that most cells will flow through the main channel and only target cells hct will be mostly isolated and collected into the side channel through dep force the separation process is described as below as cancer cells flow along the main channel and approach the gap between the electrodes pair they experience strong negative dep force on the one hand the hydrodynamic force drives the cells in the flow direction of the main channel on the other hand the ndep force repels the cell in the direction perpendicular to the electrodes in the gap the effective net force of the ndep and hydrodynamic force pushes the responsive cancer cells to the side channel without electrode activation of the cancer cells move downstream of the main channel and the other flow through the side channel due to hydrodynamic splitting similarly without electrode activation of normal hek cells move downstream of the main channel and the other flow through the side channel however when the electrodes are electrically activated the cancer cells will be pushed only to the side channel whereas the other cells keep their motion in the main channel thus isolation of the cancer cells from other cells can be realized dep before the isolation of the cancer cells from others in the dep sorter we need to know whether the colorectal cancer cell has negative dep to answer this question we first measured the dep spectrum using wedge microfluidic chip as shown in fig since dep spectrum is independent of the geometry of the electrodes and flow condition wedge chip was designed to measure the spectrum of the hct cells the wedge was formed by two gold electrodes with thickness of the distance between their edges is with the sharp edges of the two gold electrodes we can achieve nonuniform electric field required for the dep the hct cell solution will first be loaded into the wedge chip the solution should be exactly the same as the one that will be used in the dep sorter for cell separation since the solution in this chip is almost at rest the effect of hydrodynamic force on the cells due to the pressure driven flow is neglected hence dep force could become the major force on these cells and could be easily observed and characterized if it exists for ndep the cells will move away from the tips whereas for the pdep the cells will move toward the tips the faster the motion the stronger the dep force with this wedge dep test microfluidic chip very small amount of sample about is sufficient for measuring the dep spectrum figure shows the actual motion of the cells under the ndep force in the wedge microfluidic chip after electric activation of the electrodes the time interval between consequence images the ac frequency and voltage are khz and vp respectively it shows clearly that when two sinusoidal electric signals with phase shift of are applied to the electrodes the cells begin moving away from the two sharp tips where the electric field intensity is the strongest this means that these cells experience negative dep force which leads them moving from the high electric field area to the low electric field region the faster the motion the stronger the ndep force thus the dep force can be estimated by measuring the cell flow velocity and the dep spectrum can be obtained by measuring the velocity of the cell motion in the initial stage after the electric activation at various frequencies figure shows that cells were moving for relatively long distance in short period e in this case in the light of the measured dep spectrum we could select the frequency to achieve either the ndep or pdep force conveniently for the cell separation experiment the hct cells dep spectrum is displayed in fig for the given medium figure shows that in the frequency band of hz mhz and mhz respectively the cancer cells experience ndep force whereas in the frequency range of mhz the cells display pdep force the motion of the cancer cells is sensitive to the ac frequency the cancer cells experience the approximately maximum ndep at the frequency of khz which was then selected for the dep sorter to isolate the cancer cell visualization of the dep figure shows visualization of the separation of hct from the hek and coli cells due to dep force in the microfluidic chip with and without the electrical activation the fluid flows from the inlet at the left side to the outlet at the right side in the main channel in fig the flow rate is min in fig approximately of the colorectal cells flow through the gap between the two electrodes in the main channel without ac electrode activation however with the electric activation of the electrodes at voltage of vp and frequency of khz almost all colorectal cells migrate to the side channel under the ndep force as shown in fig whereas the hek cells and coli remain in the same motion through the gap as if there was no ac activation figure demonstrates that dep has high specificity for cell separation and the hct cancer cells can be separated from the hek and coli cells thus dep can provide an opportunity for cancer cell isolation from other cells due to their extremely small size compared to hct cells and hek cells the coli cells cannot be seen in fig therefore high magnification lens are needed to make the observation of the coli cell behavior in the separation process unambiguous the coli cells can be observed under magnification as shown in fig where the exposure time is and the time step between the two sequences is as shown in fig the small coli cells flow along with the labeled hek cells after the electric activation the bacteria keep moving along the flow direction in the main channel with hek cells this indicates that there is either no ndep force or the dep force is too small to deflect the coli to the side channel this result matches our prediction that coli has negligible dep force compared to cancer cells for separation that is based on cell size since according to eq dep force is proportional to cube of the particle radius and coli is much smaller than the cancer cell this result also shows that with large differentiation in particle or cell radius size based dep separation could also be leveraged for separation this is one of the traditional methods for dep selectivity flow to quantify the presented dep sorter performance for the cancer cell separation we measured the cell enrichment factor which is defined as b b where is the total cells blocked right before the electrode gap by dep force denotes the total collected cells that flow into the side channel and is the total cells flowed through the gap in the main channel the enrichment factor is calculated based on movie obtained from the visualization the measured enrichment factor as function of the sample flow rate at constant voltage of vp is shown in fig it is noted that the enrichment factor decreases with the flow rate since the hydrodynamic force experienced by the cancer cells increases with the increased flow rate the total force that the cells experience is the sum of the vector forces of dep and hydrodynamics the hydrodynamic force mainly pushes the cells to flow along the main channel at high flow rate due to the large hydrodynamic force it is very difficult to deflect the cells to the side channel thus hydrodynamic and dep forces are competitive the higher the flow rate the lower the enrichment factor when the flow rate is less than min the enrichment factor is indicating that the dep force is much larger than the hydrodynamic forces however when the flow rate increases to min the hydrodynamic force overwhelms dep with resultant minimal deflection of cancer cells the effect of applied voltage on the dep separation is shown in fig which indicates that the enrichment factor increases with increased electric field or equivalently voltage the flow rate in fig was maintained constant at min as we can see from eq dep force increases with the increased gradient of the square of the electric field or equivalently voltage consequently enrichment factor is rapidly increased with the increase in the voltage within the test range of the voltage figure indicates that increasing the voltage could be an easy way to enhance the dep enrichment factor one of the objectives of the dep separation is to purify the cancer cells for sample preparation in clinical diagnostics to quantify the dep purification of the colon cancer cells we estimated the concentration of the colon cancer cell on the side channel with and without the electrical activation to simplify the calculation we only focus on the hct and hek cells since coli is too small to see clearly the result is given in fig where the concentration of the hct cells is before the electric activation however with the electric activation on the dep sorter the concentration of hct cell was increased to in the side channel another way to quantify the purification is the ratio of cell number of hct cell to that of hek cell as shown in fig the ratios in the side channel with and without the electric activation are and respectively e approximately increase in folds with such simple device fig demonstrates the capability of the dep sorter to separate and purify the cancer cells in this work dep principle is applied to the isolate the hct colorectal cancer cell from hek kidney cell and coli bacteria based on cell dielectric property g permittivity conductivity and size given cell may have specific dielectric property that is different from that of other cells such difference may be leveraged for dep separation since the structure is very simple it should be easy to be integrated and applied to other system as well as long as the electrodes can be built in the channel however in clinical application the separation of the colorectal cancer cells from other cancer cells or epithelial cells could be required and could be more difficult as shown in fig the enrichment factor decreases with an increase in flow rate furthermore in practice often high throughput is required which in turn demands high flow rate fortunately as shown in fig the enrichment factor increases rapidly with the voltage therefore both multiple parallel channels and higher voltage could be used in high throughput to ensure high enrichment factor so that sufficient amount of interested cells can be isolated and collected for assays downstream another method is to add another electrode pair on the top side of the channel opposite to the electrode pair on the bottom side in this case the electric field could be higher to increase the enrichment factor we have designed and fabricated microfluidic cell sorter based on conventional dep and successfully applied it to manipulate and isolate the colorectal cancer hct cells from the mixture with human embryonic kidney hek and coli cells the sorter is microfabricated using plastic lamination technology dep spectrum of the colorectal cancer cell has been measured the effect of parameters such as flow rate and applied voltage has been investigated as well the present work indicates that colorectal cancer cells can be separated and isolated from other cells by dep therefore dep could provide new opportunity for clinical cancer diagnosis  we show that for metal graphene dielectric sandwich structures charge doping in graphene depends on both the work functions of the metal and the dielectric using s core level photoemission spectroscopy we determine the charge doping in graphene for one sided metal contacts as well as for sandwich structures that are commonly used in graphene devices the measured fermi level shifts are in good agreement with model that predicts that the difference in charge doping for graphene on metal compared to graphene sandwiched between metal and dielectric is given by ef metal dielectric the contact resistance between metal and graphene affects device performances that use graphene as the conducting channel for example in field effect transistors fets one reason for high contact resistances is the fermi level shift in graphene at metal contacts due to interface charge doping effects this causes band bending in the graphene at the edge of the metal contact and consequently resulting in charge injection barrier on the other hand this band bending may be exploited for separation of photo excited charges to generate photocurrent thus it is critical to understand the metal induced charge doping and the associated shift of the fermi level at the graphene metal interface here we show that the fermi level position can be determined from regular ray photoemission spectroscopy xps and importantly while our experiments show that the pure metal graphene interface is well described by previous density functional theory dft computation the technologically more important case of metal contact on supported graphene may be significantly modified by the support consequently the choice of the support material is equally important as the metal in tuning the contact resistance low electron density of states close to the dirac point of graphene cause significant shift of the fermi level even for small charge transfers to graphene this property is also known as the variable work function of graphene because shifts of the fermi level by several tenths of an ev relative to the dirac point due to charge doping changes the energy separation between the fermi level and the vacuum level work function by the same amount the variable work function behavior of graphene has been exploited in potential new electronic devices such as the recently demonstrated barristor device however it is not just the work function that is changed due to shift of the fermi level but all other electronic energy levels that are referenced to the fermi level are shifting likewise this basic relationship between the shift in the fermi level and the s core level is illustrated in fig the relative shifts of the energy levels have implications for interpretation of spectroscopic measurements on graphene and importantly may also be exploited for measuring the charge doping level in graphene the relationship between fermi level shift and the s core level shifts due to rigid bandshift has also been demonstrated for graphite intercalation compounds by comparing s peak shifts with computed fermi level shifts for graphene metal interfaces we show that s peak shifts can be related to metal contact induced charge doping of graphene subsequently we utilize this relationship between s shifts and fermi level position in graphene to determine charge doping effects at complex metal graphene dielectric sandwich structures the doping of graphene by metallic contacts is well established in first approximation this can be described by charge transfer between the metal and graphene due to differences in work functions more detailed dft simulations suggest that the dipole formed due to charge redistribution at the interface between the metal and graphene shifts the charge neutrality point e the metal work function for which no charges are transferred to graphene to metal work function that is ev higher than that of graphene the charge doping of graphene on metal surfaces and the accompanying fermi level shift relative to the dirac point has been confirmed for some metals by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy arpes of the graphene band at the brillouin zone point of particular interest to this paper shift of the dirac point of ev for pt ev for ir and ev for cu was reported although arpes is the most direct measurement of the fermi level position relative to the dirac point the special sample conditions that need to be met limit this technique to fundamental surface science investigations in general for arpes measurements graphene single crystals are needed and the graphene should be close to the surface e buried interfaces are difficult to study by arpes it was also suggested that peak shifts in raman scattering can be used to extract doping levels in graphene however convolution of peak shifts due to doping with contributions from lattice strain may make raman spectroscopy challenging for measuring doping levels reliably on the other hand measuring the s peak position in xps is straightforward with an accurate calibration of the electron energy analyzer for example by using highly oriented pyrolytic graphite hopg as reference sample small shifts in the s positions can be detected in xps the s peak position is referenced to the fermi level consequently shift in the fermi level that changes the graphene work function also shifts the s core level by the same amount as is schematically illustrated in fig xps is however not without limitations strongly interacting metals would cause chemical shifts that may dominate the s peak position therefore in this paper we only consider weakly interacting metals e cu pt al and ir that maintain the dirac cone of graphene in most realistic device structures graphene would be supported on an insulating substrate and metals are deposited to make electrical contacts therefore it is very important to know how the charge doping of graphene is affected by dielectric or semiconducting substrate in order to prepare an as clean as possible interface we avoid mechanical and or solution transfers of graphene onto dielectric semiconducting substrates instead we inverse the dielectric graphene metal structure by using graphene directly grown by cvd on weakly interacting metals e cu pt and ir and deposit metal oxide on top graphene on pt and ir are grown in ultra high vacuum uhv by exposure to ethylene at and respectively graphene on copper is grown on polycrystalline copper foils in tube furnace using methane hydrogen mixture the inert nature of graphene enables us to transport the graphene covered surface through air brief uhv annealing is sufficient to desorb any contamination from the surface the direct cvd growth is limited to late transition metals for characterizing the al graphene interface which is of interest because of the low work function of al we resorted to the approach of intercalating al after graphene has been grown on ni since al alloys very easily with the ni substrate care has to be taken in the intercalation process to not exceed critical temperature we have thoroughly studied this intercalation process and substrate alloying before and details can be found in ref after characterizing the pure metal graphene interface we investigated the metal graphene oxide sandwich structure by reactive vapor deposition of al or metal in torr atmosphere in uhv tio was grown by pulsed laser deposition in torr oxygen atmosphere the pld chamber is connected by an in situ vacuum transfer system to the xps chamber the xps data were acquired with channel hemispherical analyzer non monochromatized dual anode ray source was used the s shifts reported here are relative to the s position of hopg reference sample first let us demonstrate the use of s spectra for determining the fermi level position for example figure in ref shows systematic study of high resolution s xps spectra measured with soft rays at synchrotron radiation source for graphene grown in ultra high vacuum on various metal substrates the s binding energy is shifted for the different investigated metals pt ir rh and ru relative to that of hopg here we argue that the peak positions can be explained by simply accounting for the fermi level shift for the weakly interacting metals pt and ir e metals that form negligible chemical interaction with graphene single peak is observed at ev and ev lower binding energy compared to hopg respectively note that this shift in the core level is very close to the values reported for shifts of the fermi level relative to the dirac point in arpes studies for the strongly interacting metals rh and ru one would not necessarily expect relationship between the core level position e fermi level and the metal work function however due to lattice mismatch between graphene and metals graphene forms moir superstructures on metal substrates in this moir structure regions in which carbon atoms are in the right position for forming covalent bonds to the metal substrates and regions where the carbon atoms cannot form chemical bonds to the substrate exist consequently the s spectra exhibit two components one component where the s peak position is dominated by chemical shifts due to chemical bond formation and second s component for regions where graphene does not make chemical bonds with the substrate somewhat surprisingly even for these strongly interacting metals this second component exhibits binding energies that can be explained by fermi level shift due to the work function difference between the metal and graphene for ru and rh shift of the second s component of ev and ev to higher binding energy compared to hopg is observed respectively in addition to these literature data xps data for graphene on cu pt and al ni are shown in fig for the clean graphene metal samples we measure c peak shift for al cu ir pt and of ev respectively the pt peak shift corresponds well to the previously reported data shown in fig the ir peak is in less good agreement most likely because of an overlap of the s peak with the ir peak and related challenges in de convoluting these peaks with the poorer resolution of our spectrometer the s peak for cu and al was not reported in the above cited publication because of the more difficult non uhv sample preparation procedures the increased s binding energy for these metals indicates an type doping as is expected for low work function metals the s peak shifts are in good agreement with the reported fermi level shifts measured by arpes thus suggesting rigid bandshift as indicated in fig in fig we plot our data together with previously reported peak shifts relative to hopg versus literature values of the metal work function in this plot the peak shift varies monotonically with the metal work function furthermore we compare the core level shifts with calculated fermi level shifts using the computed work functions for the different metals the agreement between the core level shifts and the anticipated fermi level shift is good however small general shift of the charge doping to lower metal work function is observed for the experiments compared to the computed values in particular the metal work function at which no charge doping of graphene occurs is extrapolated from the measurements to ev taking the commonly cited neutral work function of graphene as ev an interface dipole between metals and graphene of ev is obtained e little smaller than the ev derived in the dft simulations to investigate the role of dielectric substrate in the charge doping of graphene we choose o al and tio as dielectric materials these materials were chosen because they span wide range of different work functions furthermore the chosen oxides also have technological relevance al has been widely discussed as dielectric material for graphene titania is sometimes used as seed layer to improve the wetting of graphene and finally yttria exhibits excellent wetting behavior on graphene the measurement of the s peak position after growth of nm of these materials shows significant shifts compared to the clean metal graphene interface as is illustrated in figs and for cu and pt substrates respectively this indicates that the charge doping of graphene may be strongly influenced by the wide bandgap material the strongest change has been observed for graphene pt where the fermi level shifts from ev below the dirac point type doped to ev above the dirac point type doped after growth of yttria smaller but still significant variation of the doping level is observed for alumina and titania layers on graphene pt we also performed measurements for yttria alumina and titantia on graphene cu as well as for yttria on graphene ir the measured graphene s core levels are summarized in fig and in table table also lists literature values for the work functions of the materials how can the change in the fermi level for metal graphene dielectric sandwich be explained generally aligning the vacuum level at an insulator semiconductor metal contact is described by schottky contact model this simple model neglects chemical bonding and interface states which may be fulfilled in the case of an inert graphene interface layer that separates the oxide from the metal in schottky contact space charge region in the bandgap material is formed whose charges are counterbalanced by charges in the metal these charges are located as close as possible to the interface to minimize electrostatic energy because of the high density of states in metals no measurable change of the fermi energy in the metal is usually observed however in the interfaces studied here the metal is replaced by graphene metal heterostructure and thus charges in the schottky contact will be located on the graphene this charge accumulation on graphene causes shift of the fermi level and consequently the s core level in order to estimate the fermi level shift as function of work function difference between the metal and the oxide we model the interface as plate capacitor in this model the contact potential is equal to the potential on capacitor metal oxide d where are the charges per graphene unit cell is the separation between graphene and the oxide we set as the equilibrium separation between graphene and weakly interacting surfaces and a ev with the graphene unit cell area in order to estimate the fermi level shift we relate to the density of states for graphene for electron energies close to the dirac point the density of states is linear and can be expressed as e e where e ev per unit cell thus integration of the density of states with limits equal to the shift of the fermi level yields the charge per graphene unit cell of d ef from this analysis we predict fermi level shift of ef fig compares this predication with our measurements the total shift of the fermi level ef e the position on the metal minus the position after oxide deposition is plotted versus the square root of the absolute value of the work function difference between metal and oxide reasonably linear function can be fitted with slope of which compares favorably to the slope of expected from the simple capacitor model however there is fairly large scatter of the data points which is likely the consequence of the uncertainty in the values for the oxide work functions it should be mentioned that in the plot in fig the contact potential has been determined using the actual metal work function and not the effective work function of the graphene modified metal the latter is reduced by ev according to our estimate due to charge redistribution induced interface dipole using this reduced work function results in worse fit this suggests that the metal graphene interface dipole is partially compensated for by similar dipole at the graphene oxide interface the existence of dipole at the graphene oxide interface is substantiated by our studies on graphene srtio which exhibits dipole of ev in conclusion the fermi level position in graphene underneath of metal contacts may be very different for metals on free standing graphene compared to supported graphene on supported graphene it is the work function difference between the metal and the support material that determines the charge transfer to graphene the effects of the substrate may not just be important for metal contacts but also if graphene is to be purposely doped by charge transfer  a high temperature seebeck coefficient measurement apparatus with various features to minimize typical sources of error is designed and built common sources of temperature and voltage measurement error are described and principles to overcome these are proposed with these guiding principles high temperature seebeck measurement apparatus with uniaxial point contact geometry is designed to operate from room temperature to over this instrument design is simple to operate and suitable for bulk samples with broad range of physical types and shapes the seebeck coefficient is an intrinsic material property which describes the voltage that develops from given temperature difference in material v the seebeck coefficient is affected by the transport properties of charge carriers and is thus sensitive to impurities defects and phase transformations in materials as such it is studied in fields of research including superconductors solid state fuel cell electrolytes and thermoelectrics in thermoelectric devices the seebeck coefficient is an integral part the heat to electricity conversion and the figure of merit of thermoelectric material is given by zt t where is the seebeck coefficient is the electrical conductivity is the thermal conductivity and is the temperature seebeck coefficient measurements above room temperature are critical for the development and testing of high temperature thermoelectric generators thermoelectric power generation has traditionally been used as power source in remote locations more recent interest is the utilization of thermoelectric devices for wasted heat recovery making accurate measurement of the seebeck coefficient particularly critical for renewable energy applications the measurement of the seebeck coefficient at high temperatures presents many challenges and the associated history and developments on this topic has recently been reviewed high temperature seebeck measurements are often subject to irreproducibility and inconsistency in results due to lack of standardized guidelines for the measurement procedure for example errors in temperature measurement occur in the high temperature range due to poor thermal contact between the thermocouple and the sample surface leading to considerable variation of results between laboratories in this paper we describe the most commonly used seebeck coefficient measurement techniques and the associated potential drawbacks between methods additionally principles to aid the development of improved apparatuses are proposed and the construction of specific device is described seebeck measurement in principle the measurement of the seebeck coefficient in bulk materials is relatively simple it is only necessary to know the temperature difference between two locations on sample and the voltage across the two points figure shows the ideal measurement geometry where two probes make point contact with the material the probes dually serve as the thermocouples and the voltage leads across which the temperature difference and associated voltage is measured the implicit assumptions in such measurement include the system is in steady state during the measurement of the temperature and voltage and that both measurements occur simultaneously the voltage response to the temperature gradient is linear and the measurement of the temperature and voltage occurs at the same point on the sample in real instrument however non negligible errors are often present due to the inability to achieve the assumed conditions for assumption temperature and voltage measurements occur at different times in practice and the need for simultaneous measurement is well described in the review by martin the assumption can fail in practice due to insufficient signal or non zero voltage at during high temperature measurements there is often noticeable voltage offset which can ranges from few due to the electronics to almost mv which can sometimes be observed at high temperatures the origin of the large offset and its effect on the accuracy of the measured seebeck coefficient is unknown the last assumption in is never entirely accurate as there is always definite distance between the temperature and voltage measurement locations due to the finite size of the temperature sensor the smallest point source temperature sensor used in seebeck measurements is thermocouple in thermocouple junction the temperature where the wires meet is not necessarily the same as the sample temperature associated with the voltage measurement typical measurement while all instrument setups deviate from the ideal measurement conditions certain designs are less susceptible to error than others currently there are two dominant measurement geometries as shown in figs and in the first geometry in fig a bulk sample is placed between two metal blocks which act as heat source and sink in this setup the thermocouples are embedded in the metal blocks rather than directly contacting the sample this setup gives the advantage of avoiding chemical reactions between the sample and the thermocouple materials which will be discussed later and has few sample geometry restrictions however this system inherently has thermal and electrical contact resistance in these metal blocks themselves as well as across the interfaces between the sample and the metal blocks in particular the thermal contact resistances may lead to offsets in the temperature measurement in the second case shown in fig a long bar shaped sample is placed between the heat source and sink the improvement of the fig geometry over fig can be understood by analogy to and point electrical resistance measurements when measuring materials with low electrical impedance point measurements are necessary to eliminate the contact resistance errors likewise point thermal design reduces the effect of thermal contact resistance such design is shown in fig where the key difference from fig is the placement of the thermocouples along the side of the sample while this important modification eliminates the thermal contact resistance between the sample and the heat source sink several issues remain the first issue is at high temperatures where the thermal conductance of the thermocouples can draw heat away from the sample known as the cold finger effect leading to temperature difference across the thermocouple bead this effect will result in the voltage and temperature measurements being made at locations with different temperatures fig second lateral spring loading is required to ensure good thermal contact between the thermocouples and the sample surface at high temperatures plastic deformation often occurs in soft samples and can lead to poor contacts in brittle samples side loading can lead to sample fracture or breakage in an attempt to accommodate the side loading issues low spring forces are used however this can lead to high contact resistance between the thermocouple and the sample third issue is the uncertainty in the temperature reading as the thermocouple junction is contacting sample surface with an ill defined temperature because it is in temperature gradient the geometry in fig uses an elongated geometry in an effort to reduce dt dz across the thermocouple sample junctions shaping the sample into an elongated geometry may be challenging since good thermoelectric materials are often brittle and can be easily damaged during cutting further this geometry is unsuitable for flash diffusivity measurements often leading to the use of more than one sample to acquire the properties of interest for full characterization proposed instrument geometry and measurement schematic of the proposed instrument geometry that solves some of common problems described in sec b is shown in fig the uniaxial point seebeck system concept originates from nasa jpl in the during the development of an apparatus using light pipe to supply dynamic the system described below in detail encompasses several differences from the light pipe system but the geometry is generally the same the main advantages of this geometry are the thermocouples make direct contact to the sample surface the thermocouple junctions contact an isothermal temperature surface and the uniaxial design allows thermocouples to exert larger forces onto the sample surface contributing to the minimization of the thermal and electrical contact resistance in the current design the cylindrical heater element made from machinable boron nitride has through hole at the center in which the thermocouple goes through the thermocouple as will be discussed in detail later is made from bore ceramic tube and has slightly smaller diameter compared to the diameter of the hole in the heater element this design allows the thermocouple to contact directly with the sample surface independently of the heater cylinder which heats the sample surface by conduction in this design the thermocouple ceramic tube is heat sunk to the heaters thereby reducing cold finger effects this configuration is in contrast to the off axis design fig where the cold finger effect is exacerbated by the low thermocouple sample contact resistance and the temperature difference between the sample and ambient temperature the second advantage illustrated in fig is the thermocouple contact to constant temperature region on the sample surface created by the intimate contact between the heater and the sample in each of the geometries shown in fig the heaters establish temperature gradient along the principle axis the finite size of the thermocouple bead in the off axis geometry fig is only able to contact the sample surface across the temperature gradient that exists at the contact area only the proposed design in fig allows the thermocouple junction to make contact with an isothermal surface additionally the proposed arrangement of the heaters and thermocouples like the arrangement in fig allows for wide range of sample shapes and sizes to be measured typical sample fabrication methods such as hot pressing or solidification result in cylindrical samples that can be easily cut into disk shaped sample having the seebeck measurement system capable of measuring disk shaped samples is beneficial as the geometry is suitable for resistivity hall effect using van der pauw geometry and thermal diffusivity measurements further the uniaxial point geometry measures the full across the sample providing maximized voltage signals for measurement of thinner samples the third advantage of the proposed design is the application of the compressive forces by springs along single principle axis uniaxial design ensuring good thermo mechanical contacts the springs attached to the heater assembly are designed to exert uniform force onto the sample for good contact between the heaters and the sample surfaces the compression springs on the thermocouples which are independent from the heater springs provide pressure to the thermocouple junction at the sample surface it is noted that heaters and thermocouples exerting forces onto the sample surfaces by independent compression is one of the major differences from the light pipe design the uniaxial design is attractive for both brittle and soft materials as there are no tensile stresses present to promote crack propagation thermocouple in concert with system level design advancements there are specific thermocouple designs that can improve temperature and voltage measurements typical temperature measurements in high temperature environment use thermocouple types which contain platinum wires such as type or in our embodiment homemade thermocouple type composed of niobium and chromel wires is used and can sustain up to there are multiple reasons to use this non standard thermocouple type for seebeck measurements first as briefly mentioned in sec b chemical reaction between the thermocouple and the sample frequently occurs at the contact point between the two and leads to errors in the measured seebeck slope and voltage offset in order to minimize this effect thermocouples with minimal reactivity with the sample should be chosen platinum thermocouples while resistant to oxidation are rather reactive to heavy metals such as pb te ag bi and sb which are common in thermoelectric materials even traditionally nonreactive nickel has some reactivity with certain thermoelectric elements at high temperatures therefore thermocouple wires that are inert to heavy metals are desired traditional seebeck systems use one of the thermocouple wires for the voltage measurement if there is temperature difference between the point of the voltage and temperature measurements typically at least across the diameter of the wire used for voltage measurement voltage error will arise the error induced by this factor is very apparent when measuring low seebeck coefficient materials with high thermal conductivity g tungsten to reduce this effect near zero seebeck coefficient metal such as copper or niobium should be used for the voltage probe closest to the sample in combination with high seebeck material for making the thermocouple while the resulting thermocouple supplies only half the voltage of traditional thermocouples measurement of this reduced signal is well within the capabilities of modern electronics for high temperatures tungsten and niobium have been found to be preferable due to their low reactivity in our current setup the combination of the niobium and chromel is used minor drawbacks for these elements are that they must be used in an oxygen free environment and are poor thermocouples for near room temperature operation it is noted that other combinations of thermocouples are possible niobium tungsten up to above niobium tungsten rhenium copper constantan type and gold iron chromel in order to provide an additional barrier against chemical reaction thin and flexible grafoil sheets polycrystalline graphite foil for example from graftech international inc ohio are frequently used between the interface of the sample and thermocouple with high thermal conductivity mk at room temperature and low electrical resistivity m at room temperature these sheets additionally provide good thermal contact between the sample and the heating blocks while not interfering with the voltage measurements large thermocouple junctions risk reduced accuracy in the surface temperature measurement because of the temperature differences between the points of voltage and temperature measurement figure shows schematic of large beaded junction is often used in many instruments in this case the seebeck voltage measurement between and does not necessary occur where temperatures and are measured it is advised that having low pressurized inert gas such as argon or helium gas may aid the heat transfer by convection one drawback of having small beaded junction is that it suffers from poor mechanical strength forming the bead frequently embrittles the junction making the wires more difficult to handle and easier to break or otherwise damage we have found that having crossed wire junction instead of bead welded junction provides less of this mechanical problem this design is advantageous as it avoids the alloying and embrittlement associated with welding beads we currently utilize wires with diameter of inches or but other sizes have been used successfully if thin soft wire such as copper is mated with hard wire the soft wire may eventually break after many uses figure shows the cross geometry where wires threaded down bore ceramic tube are made to cross here the contact between the wires is mechanical and governed by the geometry of the crossed wires to further ensure that the junction is near isothermal the ceramic tubing used to house the wires is made of low thermal conductivity mullite inch in diameter while such thin mullite tube is delicate the force loading is strictly compressive and along the length of the tube the ability to simply and rapidly develop new thermocouple material combinations is final advantage delivered by this geometry measurement beyond fundamental changes in geometry other design features are implemented to improve accuracy in steady state measurements of the seebeck coefficient as discussed in sec a steady state measurements ideally have all measurements occur simultaneously in practice measurements of temperature and voltage are often conducted sequentially first order correction to thermal drift is to use the delta method where measurements are symmetric with time for example measurements taken in the order tc th th tc at equally spaced intervals in time account for linear drift when tc tc tc and th th th the absolute seebeck coefficient is corrected from the contribution of the voltage contact wires by subtracting off the seebeck voltage that these wires produce typically cu nb pt or the absolute seebeck coefficient for cu pt and are given by roberts and the seebeck of nb is reported by burkov the thermoelectric voltages of common thermocouple wires relative to pt were measured by nist and reported in nist monograph the seebeck coefficient can be found from the slope of the vs as discussed in sec and the multiple gradient method is implemented here in this method the sample temperatures are controlled so that values across the sample can be adjusted continuously from positive to negative the corresponding values are measured and plotted which allows any offset voltage to be eliminated in our setup the temperatures of the top heater and the bottom heater are controlled so that th and tc values oscillate around one value of the temperature which we use for the average temperature of the sample in this oscillation mode the maximum peak to peak of usually about are applied it is noted that non linear fitting of the vs plot can be indicative of poor signal to noise ratio requiring larger a of of the absolute sample temperature is often appropriate the seebeck coefficient should be measured during both the heating and the cooling cycle this ensures both repeatability and confirms the sample has not changed during the heating in the measurement environment reliability of the data is confirmed by overlapping the seebeck coefficient data taken during both heating and cooling usually the deviation between data sets is within k accuracy accounting for systematic errors are difficult to estimate and will depend on the sample type and shape typically we estimate accuracy to be for reproducible seebeck data figure shows the instrument design utilized in our laboratory for visual simplicity the front leg at the bottom of the fixture shown in fig is not shown in fig this uniaxial point geometry employs horizontal mirror plane through the center of the sample the sample is in contact with two boron nitride cylinders which have ring of six embedded cartridge heaters installed parallel to the sidewall of the cylinder this annular symmetric heater cartridge placement around the contact area allows uniform distribution of heat to the sample boron nitride satisfies the need for an insulating chemically inert contact and additionally provides high thermal conductivity thin walled inconel special metals corporation inc new york tubes are threaded into the heater assembly and connected to base plates via collar clamps this adjustable three legged geometry ensures good mating between the upper and lower heater assemblies the upper and lower base plates are aligned through the use of framework rod at each corner compressive force is exerted on the base plates and thus sample from springs controlled by wing nuts attached to the threaded framework rods together assembly f immobilizes the sample but is adjustable to accommodate slightly non parallel sample surfaces and thus achieves good thermal contact between the heaters and the sample for the measurement of the seebeck coefficient long cm crossed wire thermocouples travel down the axis of the instrument the thermocouple wires are contained within four bore mullite tube inch in diameter mullite is chosen because it has lower thermal conductivity compared to alumina which is typical material for thermocouples from the sample the thermocouple passes through the boron nitride bn heater the base plate and into the thermocouple compression assembly tca the goal of the tca is to provide low thermal contact resistance between the sample and the thermocouple attached to the thermocouple is collar clamp which provides face for spring to contact adjustment of plate in the center of the tca sets the compression on this spring the uppermost assembly in the tca provides structural support to the thermocouple in case of shearing force from the operator when changing samples the spring within the tca exerts force on the collar clamp and drives the thermocouple tip past the heater surface such motion exposes the thermocouple tip which is mechanically weak and readily fractures to avoid this motion the lowest plate on the tca is used to compress spring during sample exchange the upper assembly shows this plate engaged while the lower assembly shows the plate when the collar clamp is free to move the measurement assembly is supported on three legs which are sufficiently long to provide access to the lower tca the heaters are surrounded by reflective heat shielding to prevent radiative losses during sample exchange the heat shielding drops onto the lower triangular base plate for proportional integral differential temperature control the boron nitride cylinders have embedded thermocouples these thermocouples are not involved in the measurement of the seebeck coefficient and are only used for temperature control of heaters the resulting temperature oscillations in high temperature run are shown in fig the temperatures shown in panels and are from the seebeck measurement thermocouples for measurements at each temperature the temperature gradient is oscillated about fixed average temperature as shown in fig the resulting voltage response to the temperature gradient is shown in fig and reveals linear relationship with the slope yielding the seebeck coefficient representative seebeck data can be found in number of our publications compared to other methods several benefits are worth noting for this particular system design the fixture above the horizontal mirror plane through the center of the sample including the tca is assembled in one piece and can be manually moved vertically when mounting sample the vertical range of movement is guided by framework rods that go through the three holes located at each corner of the triangular base plate since these holes are intentionally made much larger than the diameter of the framework rods there is room for the top heater surface to be placed on sample surface with some angle this design flexibility allows better contact between the sample and the heaters when the sample surfaces are not exactly parallel additionally all springs are located far away from the sample heater area so that they do not lose elastic compression upon heating this uniaxial design allows clearance around the sample heater area and cylindrical heat shield or clam shell furnace can be located around the sample heater area the heat shield ensures uniform heating near the sample area in summary we have reviewed the traditional designs for seebeck coefficient measurement systems and identify measurement issues that can lead to systematic errors to overcome these issues uniaxial point method and other considerations such as thermocouple design are implemented in custom built measurement system the facile and flexible design also maximizes the measurement accuracy and has enabled rapid and reproducible data collection  polydimethylsiloxane pdms is nearly ubiquitous in microfluidic devices being easy to work with economical and transparent detailed protocol is provided here for using pdms in the fabrication of microfluidic devices to aid those interested in using the material in their work with information on the many potential ways the material may be used for novel devices polydimethylsiloxane pdms has come to be the most widely used material in microfluidic device fabrication due to its many advantages in fabrication ease physical properties and economy using the material to create even complex structures is simple affair although achieving good results requires experience with reliable technique the purpose of this brief article is not to review the many uses of pdms in its application to microfluidics this was provided by the group of whitesides some time ago not to mention the incredible variety of articles that apply the material in specific devices nor is it to review the many ways pdms may be used in the larger field of micro to nanofabrication certainly well covered by past researchers recognizing that entry into microfluidics is predicated upon having fabrication experience and that many lack it simple protocol for fabricating microfluidic device with pdms is provided although there are many methods for fabricating structures in pdms we focus on the most common approach here and encourage the reader to refer to other works for special needs the process outlined here and in fig presumes the work is being conducted in clean environment the use of clean room is not absolutely necessary except for the most demanding fabrication requirements however avoiding surface contamination is essential pirahna etch with subsequent rinse using de ionized water is ideal for cleaning tools and substrates the classic choice of pdms for microfluidics is dow and corning sylgard two part system with mix ratio of cross linker curing agent siloxane increasing the cross linker ratio in the mix is known to increase the rigidity of the pdms produced and some changes to the cure cycle can be performed to alter the pdms mechanical properties further mixing in other materials can alter the mechanical properties of the pdms ref or offer novel features not possible with standard pdms coating with other media gives similarly broad possibilities upon mixing the pdms must be degassed in vacuum chamber for best results and an erlenmeyer flask or large beaker with cover is recommended to avoid mess from the typically violent boiling off of the gas from the pdms the pdms may be worked with for around after mixing although its viscosity will gradually increase over this time pdms as an elastomer is known for its mold release properties and ability to replicate features down to the nanoscale with low shrinkage during cure around and excellent elastic properties myriad structures may be fabricated casting the pdms into preformed molds the construction of which is an important first step in the process using photolithography to form mold for casting the pdms structure requires mask and light source to pattern photosensitive resist polymer to match the features of the mask depending on resolution needs the mask may be simply laser printed overhead transparency dpi or resolution high resolution print on thin polymer transparency film dpi or laser quartz photomask print in chromium deposited on the quartz dpi nm the highest resolution masks are several orders of magnitude more expensive and restrict the size of the overall microfluidic device to around mm on side typically the mold is negative mold with the pdms poured into it and filling the regions left open by the mold this limits the potential configuration of the cast structure in some specific ways the cast pdms must be contiguous if the mold is to be reused if the mold is to be used and then sacrificed dissolved away topologies with multiple holes and three dimensional structures may be cast the size of feature cast must accommodate the resolution limits of the mask and illumination system feature height to width aspect ratios of are straightforward while higher aspect ratios may be achieved either through multiple spin coat exposure cycles before final development of the mold or very expensive lithographie galvanoformung abformung liga features with lower aspect ratios than about are difficult due to sagging of the pdms in use unless the pdms is made more rigid it is likely that the feature will not appear properly the mold for casting the pdms may be made of wide variety of materials even for photolithography with many different photoresists available but we will choose su su microchem newton ma usa note that even in selecting su there are many formulations suitable for forming different layer thicknesses the su is the most common molding media used for pdms based microfluidic structure fabrication using su with single spin coat limits our maximum mold thickness to around here we will aim for thickness of the process is as follows spin coat su polymer photoresist as poured onto wafer substrate si is ideal for this purpose spin curves available from the vendor are useful for estimating the appropriate spin rate to obtain the desired thickness of here we ramp up to rpm spin rate and hold for to flatten the resist followed by s spin at rpm which gives us final film thickness of the spin acceleration is rpm throughout any bubbles seen in the photoresist must be removed preferably by degassing the photoresist prior to use heating the resist to will help prebake soft bake the su to evaporate its solvent in preparation for exposure here we prebake the su coated wafer at on polished al hot plate for min we ramp up the temperature to this temperature at min to give improved film adhesion generally the thicker the film the longer it takes to complete evaporation of the solvent this represents one limit in the maximum thickness of the spun on film mount su covered wafer with mask atop it and expose it with uv radiation with wavelength of nm the vendor should provide an exposure energy estimate versus film thickness graph but it will be at best an estimate and requires some trial and error to obtain good results our approach uses mj cm of exposure energy on standard mask aligner ma uv suss microtec garching germany with nm uv light source making thicker structures can be accomplished by repeating steps to and then continuing onward postexposure baking aids in cross linking the exposed portions of the su in preparation for its development this step will also require some trial and error we ramp up to bake of min at at min and ramp down after this time at the same rate care in ramping the temperature up and down in baking will reduce the appearance of cracks and bowing from internal stresses development using microchem su developer is straightforward requiring about min for immersion development leaving the finished mold for use in casting casting curing and releasing pdms with the appropriate pdms on hand the casting process is as simple as placing the mold in heat tolerant plastic tray or al boat and pouring pdms onto the mold control of the thickness may be made by using spacers of the appropriate thickness or the su itself to come into contact with glass or si overlay placed atop the freshly poured pdms with weight placed on top of the stack to squeeze out excess pdms placing the result in an oven at for cures the pdms which may then be peeled away from the mold and cut as desired silanization of the mold may be needed in some cases where the pdms sticks to the su or si for example exposure to the vapor of dimethyloctadecylchlorosilane in desiccator for min the pdms as cast will not stick to any other structures and it will be strongly hydrophobic there are methods for treating the pdms to reduce its hydrophobicity in addition to other characteristics such as gas permeability but to aid bonding the most common approach is to expose the surface to be bonded to oxygen plasma for about min the pdms may then be placed as soon as possible and in less than minute against similarly cleaned si glass or another pdms layer to form permanent bond to aid in alignment small amount of methanol can be used to keep the surfaces separate for short time selective exposure to liquid silanes can make it possible to have effective pdms release in specific regions e for valves naturally the structure will require inlet and outlet connections many researchers pierce especially large open regions within the bonded pdms structure using needles for temporary applications but more permanent applications require hose bibs or grommets cocured into the pdms structure an interesting alternative is the use of vacuum to draw the pdms against plate with prealigned inlet and outlet ports such bond is strong yet easily released integrating microheaters sensors electro osmotic fluid pumps and many other devices may be accomplished with few additional steps to provide inexpensive and complete microfluidic devices with remarkable capabilities  in the perspective of the laser lightning rod the ability of femtosecond filaments to trigger and to guide large scale discharges has been studied for several years the present paper reports recent experimental results showing for the first time that filaments are able not only to trigger and guide but also to divert an electric discharge from its normal path laser filaments are also able to divert the spark without contact between laser and electrodes at large distance from the laser comparison between negative and positive discharge polarities also reveals important discrepancies in the guiding mechanism if lightning is one of the most fascinating phenomena occurring in the atmosphere it is also one of the most dangerous this spark discharge of several kilometers can cause severe damages to ground infrastructures during history several techniques have been developed for lightning protection such as benjamin franklin famous lightning rod or the rocket triggering device the laser lightning rod would be valuable alternative to lightning rockets this concept relies on the generation by powerful lasers of long plasma column acting like an extension of the classical rod toward thunder clouds and would be able to significantly empty electrically charged clouds preventing lightning stroke to hit sensitive building or facilities imagined in the early the concept of laser triggered discharges was first investigated with high energy co and yag lasers despite the first real scale demonstration of triggering in this path was progressively abandoned because of the discontinuous profile of the plasma generated with such long pulses through avalanche breakdown following the development of femtosecond cpa chirped pulse amplification laser systems the study of ultrashort filaments in air and their ability to generate thin uniform plasma channel over very long distances opened new perspectives in the field laser filamentation is nonlinear propagation regime affecting femtosecond laser beams provided their peak power exceeds critical value gw at nm in air dynamical competition between kerr effect which tends to self focus the beam diffraction and multiphoton ionization which defocus the beam leads to the formation of self guided light pulses called filaments maintaining high peak intensity over long distances these self guided pulses leave in their wake uniform weakly ionized plasma column laboratory scale experiments of large discharges guiding by filamentation in plane rod geometry have demonstrated the ability of filaments to decrease the breakdown threshold by and to guide the spark over to meters for positive upward leader and for negative upward leader in this manuscript we study the guiding efficiency of filaments with positive and negative voltage in plane rod electrode rod geometry we also report the first demonstration of the possibility to deviate long spark discharge from its natural point of attachment finally the guiding of discharge without contact between laser and electrodes is investigated experiments were performed at the dgata center in toulouse in the high voltage facility foudre the first experimental setup is presented in figure large planar electrode connected to high voltage marx generator was placed above spherical one cm of diameter connected to the ground the high voltage generator could deliver up to mv in both polarities the voltage applied consisted in standard voltage waveform modeling fast lightning process to produce the plasma filament the laser enstamobile built by amplitude technologies was used this laser is mobile ti sa cpa laser chain delivering pulses of up to mj energy with duration of fs tw at repetition rate of hz to postpone the onset of filamentation and transport the beam without damaging the optics linear chirp of about fs was impressed to the pulse the laser beam of mm diameter was weakly focused in order to create the plasma filaments tangentially to one side of the sphere electrode the plasma column was composed of bundle of filaments starting at distance of after the lens and continuing over distance of in the gap separating the two electrodes the multiple filaments formed quasi homogeneous circular plasma column several mm in diameter the current circulating through the electrode was measured with rogowski coil while the voltage on the planar electrode was measured through resistive probe figure shows still image of an unguided discharge obtained in the absence of laser with voltage mv applied to the plane electrode the corresponding temporal evolution of the voltage on the charged electrode and the current circulating in the spherical electrode is presented in figure figures and show the same measurement when plasma filament is formed between the electrodes at time s during the voltage rising front in this case the discharge path is perfectly straight and follows the filament axis showing that the guiding is achieved over the full length of the discharge it has been shown that the plasma column formed by laser filaments can lower the breakdown field by to here we investigate the evolution of this effect as function of the delay between the beginning of the voltage front and the laser filament formation the average peak electric field between the electrodes is defined as the maximum applied voltage divided by the separation gap the value of this average field is plotted in figure as function of for positive figure and negative applied voltage figure the natural breakdown field in absence of laser filament is measured for both polarities and indicated in the graphs by the dashed orange line it is equal to kv cm for positive voltage polarity and to kv cm for negative voltage polarity which are close to the stability field amplitudes for streamer reported by gallimberti et al as shown by the blue stars in figure when the discharge is guided over the full length by the filament the breakdown field can be decreased to kv cm for positive voltage and to kv cm for negative voltage this corresponds to decrease of the breakdown field of and respectively the smaller decrease with the negative voltage might be due to the fact that negative leader propagate slowly compared to positive leader see also discussion later partially guided discharges are also presented in figure as green dots such discharges were only observed with negative voltage polarity most of them were obtained when the laser pulse arrived after the voltage was applied while fully guided discharges occurred when concerning the establishment of the guided discharge with negative applied voltage the mean delay between the laser and the guided discharged was with high fluctuation around by contrast fully guided discharges obtained with positive voltage occurred always with short delay between the onset of the voltage and the laser arrival in average in this case the delay between the laser and the discharge was very reproducible with standard deviation of as shown in figure because of the size and shape of the hv electrodes the electric field in the gap is strongly asymmetric and the breakdown is initiated by ascending streamers leaders from the sphere electrode discharge obtained with positive polarity on the hv electrode corresponds to the propagation of an ascending negative leader and vice versa as consequence of the differences between negative and positive leader characteristics and propagation speed results obtained with positive and negative polarities are quite different estimation of the negative discharge velocity based on the delay between the laser and the spark gives x s in good agreement with previously reported values for laser guided negative leader velocities for comparison similar estimation for the positive discharge gives x s deviation of discharge second experiment was performed to demonstrate the possibility to deviate discharge from its natural impact point the setup was the same as previously but second electrode connected to the ground named in figure was placed besides the spherical electrode named to represent critical site electrode was sharp tip placed cm closer to the planar electrode than electrode tip and sphere electrodes represent respectively natural geometrical reinforcement of structure to protect and sacrificial lightning diverter consequently without the application of the laser the natural discharge always occurred on electrode in this configuration when the laser synchronization was adjusted according to the values determined previously the discharge was always triggered and guided on the diverted path starting with electrode see figure the process is efficient in both voltage polarities and its reproducibility has been checked over shots striking feature is the fact that guided and diverted discharges were obtained even if spontaneous discharge starting from the tip electrode had already been initiated as shown in figure in figure it is clearly seen that slowly rising current corresponding to the natural discharge is first detected on the tip but it drops quickly to zero with the abrupt rise of the current measured along the guided discharge laser guided discharge second test campaign has been also performed at dgata center during october the purpose was to demonstrate that guiding of discharges was possible at long distances from the laser and with higher discharge current laser triggering of high power discharges with long duration has been reported in ref with centimeter scale gaps at distance of from the laser in this experiment we intended to guide discharge currents close to typical values in negative lightning stroke with relatively large gap lengths at larger distances from the laser the experimental set up is shown in figure to achieve large distance between the laser source and the discharge area we have used mobile hv generator producing voltage waveforms having fast rise and long decrease ms with maximum voltage of kv corresponding to discharge current of ka the ground electrode consisted in short metallic cylinder with an inner diameter of mm through which the laser was propagating the hv electrode was metallic sphere set typically cm from the ground electrode the laser beam was expanded and focused by telescope to produce continuous ionized channel between the electrodes the voltage on the second electrode was measured with resistive probe while the discharge current flowing from the grounded electrode was monitored through rogowski coil triggered and guided discharges were obtained reliably at distance of from the laser the maximum possible distance inside the building containing both the laser and the hv generator examples of guided and unguided discharges and the corresponding current and voltage signals are shown in figure guided discharges with current exceeding ka were obtained with good reliability at the same applied voltage level an increase of the discharge current of was observed when the discharge was guided by the laser in this configuration the field induced between the electrodes is almost symmetric due to electrodes geometry for this reason discharge inception happens simultaneously on both electrodes resulting on poor dependence of the applied voltage polarity we measured breakdown field of kv cm for negative polarity and kv cm for positive polarity as shown in figure natural discharges often present double arc structure in the presence of laser filament decreases of the breakdown voltage of and were obtained with negative and positive polarity respectively the only noticeable difference between the voltage polarities concerns the optimal delay between the laser and the voltage front laser guided discharge without contact between laser and the purpose was to assess the sensitivity of triggering and guiding to alignment conditions especially unfavorable electric field configurations where the laser path was not in contact with the hv electrode and the laser was not parallel to the electric field in previous experimental study fuji et al reported guiding of discharge without contact between the first electrode and the filament they also observed the appearance of slow discharge mode when the distance electrode filament exceeds cm the set up was the same as in figure except that misalignment of the electrodes with respect to the laser path was deliberately introduced as shown in figure result of guided and unguided discharge for displacement of the second electrode cm is shown in figure in the absence of filament the discharge follows quasi direct trajectory given by the field lines inside the gap when the filament is formed in the gap it is able to deviate the discharge path increasing the discharge length by similar results were obtained with negative polarity the maximum separation allowing laser guiding was cm for and cm for see illustration on figure when both electrodes were displaced the guiding was maintained up to cm cm figure again we observed that this guiding was very robust as long as the delay between laser and voltage pulse was maintained at an optimal value for all results presented in figures and the plasma filament was placed in the plane defined by the two electrodes which contains the lines of maximum electric field we also tested scheme in which the filament was laterally displaced with respect to electrode gap see figure in this case the discharge deviation by the laser was not as systematic as in the previous case but several shots were positive in order to discuss the results it is useful to recall the mechanism by which the laser filament initiates an electric discharge the femtosecond pulse creates plasma column of quasi constant initial electron density extending between both electrodes this plasma column disappears by two processes the electrons can recombine directly to the parent ions or they can be captured by oxygen molecules recombination on parent ions occurs within ns whereas the recombination by attachment follows an exponential law of ns decay time after the attachment process these negative oxygen ions have long lifetime up to tens of millisecond limited by diffusion of molecule ions out of the filament region and therefore they keep for long time memory of the filament geometry the static external field accelerates free electrons which release their kinetic energy by joule heating leading to the formation of hot air column the heated air column then expands radially leading to the delayed appearance of depressurized channel at the center of the filament path the resulting low density column offers privileged path for discharge in parallel electrons loosely bound on neutral oxygen molecules can be easily released by current heating leading to decrease of the critical temperature for leader development this explains why fully guided discharges can develop even if the laser pulse is applied well before the voltage pulse as seen in figure we now discuss the effect of voltage polarity observed in part ii following models described in the literature for long air gap discharges due to the electrodes geometry the field induced between the electrodes is strongly non uniform and its amplitude is much larger near the sphere than near the planar electrode as shown in figure for this reason the discharge is expected to start always from the sphere electrode as indeed observed in the experiments for negative polarity applied to the planar electrode positive upward leader is developing from the top of the spherical electrode this leader develops as follows when the high voltage waveform is applied the free electrons present in the air near the spherical electrode are accelerated and produce other free electrons by avalanche effect these electrons are moving toward the direction of an increase of the field and regroup near the electrode corona discharge thus appears with the development of streamer bundle within the risetime of the voltage pulse these positive streamers can attain typical length of in with an appropriate local external field these streamers regroup at the stem of the corona in hot plasma k column which progresses toward the high voltage source the leader the positive leader propagation is sustained by the corona discharge at its tip which provides the current necessary to heat the leader when the leader propagates it increases locally the electric field at its extremity leading to further enhancement of the corona discharge consequently the leader development process is coupled phenomenon between hot plasma column the leader and the local discharge which sustains it the tip corona when the positively charged leader reaches the negative high voltage electrode the return stroke induces the spark discharge as noted above the main role of the laser filament is to offer preferential path for the streamers and the leader in the case of positive upward leader the transition from streamer inception to leader is very fast especially when the voltage rise time is as short as in our case for this reason it is difficult for the filament to guide the discharge once the streamers have started to develop we further elaborate on this point electrostatic calculations show that the electric field on the top of the sphere is about three times higher than the field at the point of contact with filaments on the edge of the spherical electrode this means that the field at the top of the electrode will reach the value of kv cm necessary for streamer inception at the edge of the rising voltage front when the rising voltage reaches the value of kv see figure this value is in good agreement with measurements from the literature and corresponds to an averaged field of kv cm therefore in order to prevent the development of spontaneous streamers nascent at the top of the spherical electrode it is necessary to offer preferential path though filamentation before this critical field is reached we note that all fully guided discharges obtained with negative applied polarity appear indeed when the laser arrives before the voltage has reached this value see figure by contrast all partially guided discharges appear when the voltage at the time of laser arrival is higher than the inception voltage furthermore the unguided part of the discharges always starts at the top of the spherical electrode at positive polarity on the planar electrode electrons appear close to the spherical electrode at the same inception voltage but streamers development is much slower since electrons move toward decrease of the field which inhibits their multiplication for this reason the required average field for the development of leader is two time larger as consequence there is larger time interval during which hydrodynamic expansion of the filament heated air column can develop in the absence of perturbing streamers defining better preferential path for the discharge in this case the decrease of breakdown voltage and the delay between filament arrival and the onset of guided discharge is mainly ruled by the hydrodynamics of the hot air column this explains the more pronounced decrease of external voltage required for discharge guiding and the short and reproducible time interval between arrival of the filament and the initiation of the discharge seen in the measurements in some cases long negative discharges can develop by discrete steps with the formation of space charge leaders inside the gap the diagnostics used in our measurement did not allow us to show evidence of these phenomena which generally appears in larger gaps implications for laser lightning the obtained results are very encouraging in several aspects for the triggering and the guiding of lightning towards safe sacrificial site first the presence of filament obviously decreases the voltage required to obtain discharge this effect can occur at long distances from the laser we remind that ionization induced by filamentation has been measured recently up to km distance from the laser the decrease of dielectric breakdown can reach factor two for positive discharges which would correspond to situations where the bottom of cloud is positively charged furthermore the initiation of the triggering of an electric discharge is flexible in terms of alignment it is not necessary to have the filament propagating perpendicular to the electric field lines for negative discharges the diversion of the discharge from preferential natural path can occur even if the natural discharge has already started the preferential path defined by the filament track is somewhat analogous to the conditions of dart leader in lightning when plasma channel from the first leader is present one should also note that the voltage waveforms used in our measurements present much shorter risetime than the one observed in real lightning storm the sensitivity of the guiding effect on the time delay between laser and voltage front should be much smaller in real condition where the on ground potential grows on millisecond timescale we have demonstrated the ability of the filament to deviate long air gap spark discharge from their natural point of attachment when the delay between the laser and the voltage pulse are cleverly optimized the deviation is efficient for both voltage polarities we also observed very important reduction in the threshold voltage especially for positive polarity with laser filament filament induced triggering and guiding has been observed at distance of from the laser distance limited by the available space we have also observed filament guided discharges even when natural discharge had already started from rival tip electrode all these results are encouraging for the realization of laser lightning rod  the properties of complex oxide films depend sensitively on epitaxial strain this strain affects bond lengths and angles and defect types and densities thus impacting physical properties in this work we perform detailed characterization of depth dependent strain in epitaxial la sr coo lsco films on srtio srtio and laalo substrates combining high resolution ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy in addition to geometric phase analysis we elucidate fundamental link between strain state and vacancy ordering in lsco films where lattice mismatch and crystallographic orientation can be used to manipulate the modulation vector of the long range vacancy order thus providing new approach to tailor the properties of such films physical phenomena such as magnetic phase separation spin state crossovers and mixed ionic conduction make perovskite cobaltite films of great interest both for basic science and for applications in solid oxide fuel cells gas separation membranes etc high quality epilayers on single crystal substrates are favored for fundamental studies and for proof of principle device work g with oxygen hole transport in fuel cell cathodes in such structures the epitaxial strain due to the lattice mismatch with the substrate provides means to controllably modify structure thus manipulating properties lacoo provides good example as it adopts low spin non magnetic ground state in bulk but exhibits strain stabilized ferromagnetism in films in the doped case g in bulk la xsrxcoo lsco substitution of sr for la changes the co valence inducing metallic ferromagnetism but also vacancies without the use of high pressures these vacancies form in high concentrations for eventually forming ordered superstructures as exemplified by brownmillerite srcoo sco in tensile strained thin film lsco on srtio sto recent work has highlighted the complex interplay between strain and these vacancies for example interfacial magnetic phase separation occurs in sto lsco driven by accumulation of vacancies near the substrate these vacancies undergo long range ordering somehow related to epitaxial strain recently observed consequences of this vacancy ordering interfacial accumulation include spin state superlattice formation induced cation order and giant coercivity enhancement comparisons can be drawn with similar systems such as rare earth cuprates where interfacial oxygen disorder effects impact critical current density the goal of the current work is to more fully elucidate the interplay between strain state and vacancy formation ordering in lsco films we studied the effects of epitaxial strain on lsco films grown on and oriented sto and on oriented laalo lao e sto lsco sto lsco and lao lsco respectively the nominal lattice mismatch between film and substrate is for sto and for lao table films were grown by reactive sputtering at with of dc power in and ar pressures of and mtorr and with post deposition cooling in torr of high resolution cu x ray diffraction xrd was performed in wide angle xrd waxrd rocking curve rc and reciprocal space mapping rsm modes rsms were acquired with bounce ge monochromator on the primary beam but no secondary beam monochromation resulting in slightly reduced resolution and increased fluorescence background but improved signal to noise ratio scanning transmission electron microscopy stem employed nion ultrastem operated at kv with nion aberration corrector high resolution contrast images were processed using the software geometrical phase analysis gpa in the digital micrograph gatan environment specimens for stem were prepared by conventional methods grinding dimpling and ar ion milling samples were tilted to pseudocubic zone axis for stem global picture of the thickness dependent strain relaxation from waxrd is shown in fig which plots the strain relaxation percentage srp t astrained arelaxed astrained where is the out of plane lattice parameter and arelaxed and astrained are its fully relaxed bulk value and fully strained pseudomorphic value respectively note that the arelaxed used here is that of stoichiometric undistorted cubic lsco table the films are strained srp at all but exhibit very different dependence on the three substrates in sto lsco we find critical thickness for strain relaxation tcrit around above this value the srp increases only slowly reaching approximately at on lao substrates tcrit is lower the srp reaching larger values of at remarkably and despite the identical mismatch to sto in sto lsco the srp increases almost immediately from suggesting tcrit lies below if in fact it exists at all as discussed previously strain relaxation in lsco is also reflected in rcs through broad and narrow peak components high and low mosaicity associated with relaxed and fully strained regions the dependence is shown in fig which plots ibroad ibroad inarrow where ibroad and inarrow are the intensities of the broad and narrow gaussian components the trends are similar to fig the most noteworthy conclusion again being the efficient strain relaxation on sto compared to sto to probe the strain state in more detail rsms figs c were acquired around asymmetric reflections at for sto lsco and lao lsco the reflection was chosen for sto lsco the fourfold in plane symmetry is broken and we chose the and reflections to probe two orthogonal high symmetry in plane directions and in all cases white crosses mark the positions of the fully strained pseudomorphic and fully relaxed bulk lsco reflections for sto lsco fig consistent with fig we find negligible strain relaxation the situation is similar for lao lsco fig but with minor relaxation this is in stark contrast to sto however fig where we find substantial strain relaxation in both in plane directions simple estimates give relaxations at this consistent with fig the origin of the unusually efficient strain relaxation on sto and indeed the entire strain state vacancy interplay is elucidated by stem figures f show annular dark field contrast stem images from the interface regions these images confirm cube on cube epitaxy with the expected epitaxial relationships in addition to coherent interface they also reveal an obvious superstructure contrast modulation occurring on every other co plane see yellow lines this contrast is well known to be due to the structural relaxations that result from the ordering of vacancies in this system vacancy ordering occurs in the related bulk sco and high lsco compounds and similar superstructures have been found in epitaxial lsco these superstructures are indicators of vacancy ordering in the present set of sto lsco samples we have previously reported direct observation of content modulation by atomic resolution electron energy loss spectroscopic imaging note that in contrast images the dark bright pattern of co planes arises due to modulation in cation spacing resulting from the content modulation or to displaced co ions it does not arise from the variation in content directly three additional findings suggest that this vacancy superstructure provides the primary mechanism of lattice mismatch accommodation and strain relief first while in bulk such vacancy ordering is well known in high lsco and sco it has not been reported in bulk compounds to the best of our knowledge and does not occur in our own bulk samples there is thus some mechanism promoting vacancy order in epitaxial films strain being likely candidate second we find remarkable scarcity of misfit dislocations strongly suggestive of an alternative strain relaxation mechanism involving vacancy order superstructure related strain relief mechanism has in fact recently been advanced for undoped epitaxial lacoo although the origin of the superstructure is still under debate in that case finally as can be seen from figs f the modulation vector of the vacancy superstructure responds to both strain types tensile vs compressive and crystallographic orientation vs pointing to fundamental link between strain state and vacancy order likely candidate for the superstructure in figs f is the orthorhombic brownmillerite structure of bulk sco this phase has stoichiometry srcoo with lines of oxygen vacancies along the direction in alternate co planes quadrupling the unit cell along the axis see table in sto lsco fig we propose that the tensile strain is relieved by the formation of brownmillerite like superstructure with vacancy planes perpendicular to the interface e superlattice modulation vector parallel to the interface the measured la sr interplanar spacings alternate between and errors are half widths of spacing distributions giving an in plane lattice parameter of very close to twice the srtio lattice parameter see table in essence the mismatch with the substrate is accommodated by formation at low energy cost and ordering of vacancies thus generating fundamental link between strain vacancy density and order in the case of compressive strain on lao fig the vacancy planes stack parallel to the interface with out of plane to enable out of plane expansion and thus in plane compression simple analytical model supports this strain relief scenario the vector can also be controlled by crystallographic orientation as expected in brownmillerite type structure in the orientation the vacancy planes make an angle close to with the interface yellow lines in fig lower magnification images of thick films are shown in figs c illustrating domain structure in fig for example variants with vacancy planes running both perpendicular and parallel to the interface are seen close to the interface the perpendicular variant dominates transition to multi domain state occurring from the interface consistent with tcrit fourier analysis of these images was performed with gpa to obtain spatially resolved information on the local lattice relaxation in this technique strain or deformation is measured with respect to some reference area in our case the substrates the extracted strain values are thus referred to the substrate as opposed to bulk lsco such that fully pseudomorphic growth leads to zero strain circular masks with radii producing lateral resolution nm in the gpa images were defined around the reflections for sto lsco and lao lsco and the reflections for sto lsco the extracted in plane xx and out of plane yy strains again with respect to the substrate are shown in figs f and in figs i respectively positive and negative values refer to compressive and tensile strains respectively in fig lateral averages of these strains are plotted vs distance from the interface overlaid on sections of the maps from fig to scale considering sto lsco first figs and and fig top panel the first observation is that the domain structure seen in fig is clearly reflected in the strain maps figs and the strain state being remarkably inhomogeneous as expected xx and yy are anti correlated figs and near the interface xx e pseudomorphic growth and yy an out of plane lattice parameter smaller than the substrate in agreement with xrd as can be seen in the top panel of fig xx remains small out to from the interface in reasonable agreement with tcrit from xrd above this thickness xx increases in magnitude reaching at the surface where the parallel variant of the vacancy superstructure dominates correspondingly yy is relatively constant out to from the interface beyond which it relaxes gradually reaching at the surface this corresponds to an out of plane lattice parameter of and strain relaxation percentage of in good agreement with xrd fig in lao lsco figs and and fig bottom panel with compressive strain and smaller mismatch we find more uniform strain state although anti phase boundaries occur spaced by about nm this is smaller than the coherence length in our xrd several hundred nm in the growth direction several microns laterally explaining the absence of superlattice peaks as anticipated xx near the interface e pseudomorphic growth increasing away from the interface the data suggest local tcrit of about roughly consistent with xrd fig in the out of plane direction fig we find yy larger out of plane lattice spacing than the substrate with laterally averaged magnitude of at the surface such large strains are consistent with the expected from the mismatch between lao and brownmillerite like lsco in this orientation table although they exceed xrd values this discrepancy may result from differences between the local and average structures in this case importantly sto lsco is significantly different from sto first the strain state is relatively uniform in comparison to sto compare figs and and figs and we again find xx near the interface but with remarkable depth dependence fig middle panel consistent with spatially averaged results from xrd we find essentially no evidence for any well defined tcrit strain relaxation initiates immediately at the interface in sharp contrast to sto compare fig top and middle panels consistent with this the extent of strain relaxation at the film surface is substantially larger for sto than sto we propose that the surprisingly different strain relaxation behavior in vs oriented films originates from the differing orientations specifically in the case all variants can contribute to strain relaxation due to the angles with the growth direction e fig which results in finite value of n this is in contrast to the case g fig where for some variants n the vacancy superstructure strain relief mechanism thus renders crystallographic orientation very useful for controlling strain relaxation in summary by combining high resolution ray diffraction with geometrical phase analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy images we have studied the local and global strain relaxation process in la sr coo films grown on various substrates the lattice mismatch accommodation strain relief mechanism is shown to be driven by formation and ordering of oxygen vacancies we demonstrate that this defect ordering can be manipulated by lattice mismatch and crystallographic orientation opening up the possibility of controlling interfacial physical properties via engineering of ordered oxygen defect structures  we demonstrate that surface acoustic waves saws nanometer amplitude rayleigh waves driven at megahertz order frequencies propagating on the surface of piezoelectric substrate offer powerful method for driving host of extremely fast microfluidic actuation and micro bioparticle manipulation schemes we show that sessile drops can be translated rapidly on planar substrates or fluid can be pumped through microchannels at cm velocities which are typically one to two orders quicker than that afforded by current microfluidic technologies through symmetry breaking azimuthal recirculation can be induced within the drop to drive strong inertial microcentrifugation for micromixing and particle concentration or separation similar micromixing strategies can be induced in the same microchannel in which fluid is pumped with the saw by merely changing the saw frequency to rapidly switch the uniform through flow into chaotic oscillatory flow by exploiting superpositioning of the irradiated sound waves from the sidewalls of the microchannel if the flow is sufficiently quiescent the nodes of the transverse standing wave that arises across the microchannel also allow for particle aggregation and hence sorting on nodal lines in addition the saw also facilitates other microfluidic capabilities for example capillary waves excited at the free surface of sessile drop by the saw underneath it can be exploited for micro nanoparticle collection and sorting at nodal points or lines at low powers at higher powers the large accelerations off the substrate surface as the saw propagates across drives rapid destabilization of the drop free surface giving rise to inertial liquid jets that persist over cm in length or atomization of the entire drop to produce monodispersed aerosol droplets which can be exploited for ink jet printing mass spectrometry interfacing or pulmonary drug delivery the atomization of polymer protein solutions can also be used for the rapid synthesis of nm polymer protein particles or biodegradable polymeric shells in which proteins peptides and other therapeutic molecules are encapsulated within for controlled release drug delivery the atomization of thin films behind translating drop containing polymer solutions also gives rise to long range spatial ordering of regular polymer spots whose size and spacing are dependent on the saw frequency thus offering simple and powerful method for polymer patterning without requiring surface treatment or physical chemical templating since the inception of the lab on chip concept considerable effort has been made to develop strategies for reliable and efficient microfluidic actuation and manipulation the challenge is of course to overcome the large surface and viscous forces that resist fluid motion at very small scales wherein inertia and other driving forces tend to be negligible in most microfluidic systems we mention most here because as we shall discuss subsequently it is indeed possible that inertia can arise in microfluidic flows variety of overarching mechanisms have been proposed for driving microscale fluid motion as well as particle or biomolecule manipulation these can be generally classified by the nature of the external force employed to drive the fluid motion pressure gradient capillary electric magnetic and acoustic curiously acoustically driven microfluidic actuation mechanisms often considered subset of acoustofluidics wherein the application of an acoustic force on fluid gives rise to an acoustic radiation force as well as acoustic streaming time averaged bulk viscous fluid motion have to date received little attention compared to the other mechanisms in particular electrokinetically driven mechanisms this is somewhat surprising given that as one prominent review article on microfluidics puts it acoustic streaming represents one of the very few inertial phenomena that may actually play significant role in microfluidic devices in contrast the reynolds number re associated with other microfluidic actuation mechanisms is considerably lower in the range re wherein viscous dominance render fluid inertia and its associated nonlinearities irrelevant such low reynolds number hydrodynamics essentially pose significant challenges in microfluidics not least the low actuation speeds for micropumping and the difficulty in generating turbulent vortices for micromixing admittedly conventional acoustically driven microfluidic mechanisms particularly that driven by ultrasonic bulk waves at lower kilohertz khz order frequencies suffer from certain limitations that render them less attractive when compared alongside electrokinetic devices primarily at the low frequencies associated with typical ultrasonic mechanisms the millimeter order wavelengths are typically incompatible with microfluidic devices which have characteristic length scales that are at least one order of magnitude smaller and with biomolecules which have sizes that are several orders smaller in addition there is common perception that the bulk motion of mechanical parts such as vibrating flexural plates at these scales are less reliable and more prone to wear and tear cost is also factor and often acoustic microdevices are severely restricted owing to the choice of piezoelectric materials it is also questionable whether the fluid structural interactions are adequately energy efficient to render acoustically driven mechanisms sufficiently attractive relative to other actuation mechanisms furthermore most traditional forms of acoustic excitation employ bulk waves that require careful design in mounting and application to prevent their loss or conversion especially at the small scales pertinent to microfluidic applications moreover at low khz order frequencies cells are susceptible to denaturing due to the large shear forces induced along the cellular membrane in fact sonoporation which employs acoustically induced microbubble pulsation is common technique for cell membrane poration as procedural step for biomolecular transfection and intracellular loading this risk of cell lysis also renders cavitation streaming unsuitable for biological microfluidics less conventional method for acoustic driving of microfluidic flows however has demonstrated exceptional promise surface acoustic wave saw microfluidic actuation retains the benefits of using acoustic fields for driving fluid motion namely the large actuation speeds and the associated flow nonlinearities rendered by the inertial forcing while addressing the limitations discussed above that plague conventional ultrasonic methods surface acoustic waves are nanometer order amplitude electroelastic waves that propagate along the surface of piezoelectric substrate most importantly the megahertz mhz order saw vibrations facilitate fluid and particle manipulation at much finer scale that is commensurate with microfluidic devices in sec ii we shall also show that the high frequencies employed have time scales that are too short to generate shear gradients that could cause cell membrane lysis or trigger apoptotic pathways as shown in fig the saw here in the form of rayleigh wave in which the axial displacement of the solid elements are polarized normally to the surface is isolated within wavelengths typically of the substrate surface the dispersion associated with the localization of energy along very narrow surface region is thus far less than bulk waves less power is therefore necessary to drive fluid flow due to the ability to concentrate the energy into the fluid without requiring the use of acoustic focusing lenses rendering the mechanism more energy efficient than prior approaches this is particularly important in microfluidic devices where true miniaturization involves not just scale down of the fluid housing g microchannels and components g micropumps microreactors microseparators etc but also the characterization and detection methods g sensing devices and power supplies figures and show the typical size of the saw substrate and power supply used to drive microfluidics in our laboratory thus demonstrating fully portable scale device in fact saws have been commonly used for decades although not for microfluidic actuation soon after convenient method for generating them was discovered saws have since been employed in the telecommunications industry for signal processing and bandpass filtering there is on average four saw devices in every mobile phone other applications for saws are found in automotive windscreen raindrop sensors touch sensitive screens and chemical biological sensors the wide range of saw applications show at least the commercial viability of these devices with advances in nanofabrication technology saw devices can be mass produced at relatively low cost moreover the development of saw devices in these applications has advanced to state where these devices are extremely reliable the saw devices employed in our discussion here consist of double port interdigitated transducer idt with number around of nm thick straight aluminum electrode pairs sputter deposited onto single crystal yx cut lithium niobate linbo piezoelectric crystal substrate as shown in figs and the idts are fabricated using standard ultraviolet photolithography and wet etch techniques to generate the saw an oscillating electrical signal matching the operating frequency is applied to the idt using radio frequency rf signal generator and power amplifier the saw which propagates across the substrate as rayleigh wave then has wavelength which is set by the idt finger width and spacing both of which are this determines the saw resonant frequency and hence the operating frequency cs where cs s is the speed of the saw in the substrate in place of traveling saw standing saw can also be generated by incorporating reflector idt at the opposite end as shown in fig saw driven the ability for the saw to drive microfluidics arises due to the fluid structural coupling to illustrate this consider liquid drop placed on the substrate in between the idts such that it is within the propagation pathway of the saw as depicted in fig when the saw comes into contact with the edge of the drop the acoustic energy diffracts into the drop due to the mismatch between the sound velocity in the substrate cs and that in the liquid cl s for water as shown in fig in fact the angle at which the saw diffracts into the drop is specified by the ratio between the sound velocities and is referred to as the rayleigh angle sin cl cs fig known as leaky saw this energy transfer into the drop gives rise to longitudinal pressure wave front that drives bulk liquid recirculation within the drop or acoustic streaming in addition the horizontal component of the energy transfer into the drop at the rayleigh angle gives rise to body force on the entire drop in the direction of propagation of the saw this can be seen by the deformation of the drop into an asymmetrical conical structure which leans over at the rayleigh angle as shown in fig figure shows the different responses of the liquid drop to the substrate vibration in the order of increasing rf power applied to the idts at low powers the drop deforms into the axisymmetrical conical shape and leans at the rayleigh angle as discussed previously nevertheless even at these low powers the capillary vibration at the drop free surface has implications for particle assembly and sorting as will be discussed subsequently in sec ii as the power is increased sufficient body forces on the drop then build up and cause the drop to translate such motion can be exploited for moving and manipulating drops in open microfluidic circuits as will be discussed in sec ii if the drop was constrained for example by patterning circular section of hydrophobic substance g teflon af onto the substrate the concentration of energy along the substrate at the base of the drop and subsequently its leakage into the drop will result in peculiar jetting phenomenon sec ii or at the high end of the power spectrum atomization of the entire drop sec ii in what follows we will discuss each of these microfluidic schemes as well as other derivatives and their potential for application in practical microfluidic systems the overarching theme of these different manipulations is the simplicity of the device for generating the desired inertia dominant fluid particle motion as well as the sheer speeds by which these can be carried out in comparison with the most advanced microfluidic capabilities available at present drop if the drop was to comprise of colloidal suspension of nanoparticles the low power vibration of the drop induced by the saw causes unique particle assembly phenomenon figure shows delineation of the interesting particle assembly patterns that arise on the free surface of the drop with given diameter initially the colloidal particles assemble into linear concentric rings as shown by the fingerprint like patterns in regime curiously the separation between the rings is roughly corresponding to half the saw wavelength e frequency scan using laser doppler vibrometry ldv indicates that the drop free surface is vibrating at the same frequency mhz as the saw vibration induced on the surface of the substrate beneath it albeit at lower amplitudes it is thus conceivable that the linear colloidal ringlike assemblies coincide with the nodal lines of these low amplitude mhz standing wave vibrations induced along the drop interface possible mechanism by which the particles drift to form these patterns is due to the capillary force acting on the particles in concert with the surface acceleration of the standing wave vibration first proposed by falkovich et al to elucidate the well known observation that hydrophillic particles assemble onto the nodal lines of standing wave induced along liquid free surface whereas hydrophobic particles assemble onto the antinodal lines the inverse of the time taken for the particles to assemble into the ringlike assemblies is observed to scale linearly with the square of the vibration amplitude consistent with that observed in falkovich et al thus inspiring confidence that the particle drifting mechanism is indeed plausible mechanism to explain how the particles assemble onto the nodal lines upon increasing the input power and hence traversing into regime the colloidal particles in the linear ringlike assemblies are observed to cluster to form pointwise colloidal islands as illustrated in fig we note that this regime is associated with an increase in the magnitude of the interfacial vibration repeat of the ldv frequency sweeps revealed that in addition to the small amplitude mhz standing wave vibrations at the drop interface large amplitude khz order vibrations were also significant in this regime these large amplitude low frequency vibrations are associated with the capillary viscous resonance of the drop the colloidal islands therefore appear to form at the intersection between the nodal lines of the low amplitude mhz standing wave vibration and the circular nodal ring of the large amplitude khz vibration associated with the capillary viscous resonance of the drop as in regime the inverse of the time it takes for the particles to cluster into these pointwise assemblies again scales with the square of the amplitude of the vibration therefore suggesting the same particle drift mechanism as before the number and position of the colloidal island assemblies depends on the size of the drop if the input power is kept constant and the drop is allowed to evaporate the number of islands decreases successively as seen in fig this peculiar phenomenon can be explained with reference to the rayleigh lamb dispersion relationship as the drop evaporates and hence its size decreases the capillary viscous resonant frequency at which the drop vibrates increases resulting in decrease in the corresponding wavelength consequently the size of the circular nodal ring shrinks if the wavelength of the low amplitude mhz interfacial vibration and hence the separation between the linear nodal lines is assumed constant then an intersection point and hence colloidal island is sequentially lost as the nodal ring decreases in size further increases in the input power into regime leads to the onset of significant fluid streaming within the drop such azimuthal fluid recirculation in the drop will be further discussed in sec ii briefly however when streaming commences the particles are dispersed and hence the colloidal island assemblies are destroyed fig however after short transient the streaming ceases and the colloidal islands are observed to reform until the streaming recommences and erases them again as depicted in fig this cyclic phenomenon occurs aperiodically and the direction of the streaming clockwise anticlockwise is noted to be reasonably random suggesting that this regime is transient metastable state and that the commencement and cessation of the streaming is triggered by peculiar instability arising from the highly nonlinear coupling between the acoustic hydrodynamic and capillary forces as the input power is increased regime however the streaming becomes stronger and more consistent leading to permanent dispersion of the particles fig as will be discussed in sec ii once this occurs the interfacial colloidal patterns are no longer evident drop as described in sec ii drops can be translated on the saw substrate due to the body force generated on the drop as consequence of the radiation leakage into the drop at the rayleigh angle the drop translation speeds are extremely fast around cm refs and and one to two magnitudes larger than the speeds that can be achieved through other microfluidic actuation mechanisms for example electrowetting such ability to move drops on planar substrates is especially useful in open microfluidic systems in which discrete drops are transported and manipulated as opposed to closed microfluidic systems in which the liquid is housed in microchannels although not particularly suited for continuous flow analysis and particularly when larger liquid volumes are involved open systems offer the possibility of scaleability and reconfiguration such that analyses can be carried out in similar fashion to traditional benchtop protocols besides drops are often useful as carriers for biological entities and hence different biological agents can be transported separately in different drops without coming into contact with the other another advantage of open microfluidic systems is the ability to minimize the amount of liquid required as well as the contact between the liquid and solid surface especially crucial in applications that involve biomolecules in which surface adsorption is undesirable protein adsorption is commonly due to electrostatic interactions and the degree to which it occurs is dependent on the charge polarity on the protein as well as the applied voltage the open system also eliminates the attenuation of detection signals through channel walls although it is prone to contamination and evaporation possible way to circumvent this problem is to confine the system within an oil medium which has also been found to suppress adsorption indeed saw driven drop translation has been employed for various biological applications tan et al demonstrated that this mechanism allows for rapid and efficient uptake of microparticles on substrate for example in biosensors for environmental air monitoring which requires the collection and concentration of airborne particulates into carrier for subsequent detection fig as the drop translates across surface dusted with these microparticles the acoustic streaming within the drop aids in sweeping up the particles from underneath the drop into its bulk another application for the saw driven drop translation is in the fast and effective seeding of cells into porous bioscaffolds for tissue bone regeneration static seeding methods which rely on gravity driven perfusion are extremely slow typically hours to weeks given the large capillary resistances imposed by the small order pore sizes whereas bulk seeding methods which employ bioreactors that work on the principle of agitation vacuum suction or sedimentation for example lack the ability for fine control that microfluidic systems offer by rapidly moving drop containing suspension of cells to be seeded towards scaffold placed in its path we have found that the seeding process can be significantly accelerated as well as improved cells are seeded into the scaffold in under moreover saw cell seeding also offers greater penetration depth into the scaffold as well as more uniform seeding in contrast to the static method which is often plagued by insufficient and superficial cells seeded along scaffold periphery instead of deep within penetration as shown by the results in fig moreover the rapid speed of the seeding with the saw allows multiple drops to be sequentially driven into the scaffold with every successive drop containing the cell suspension that is driven into the scaffold we observe an additional mm of seeding penetration the scanning electron microscopy sem imaging of seeded yeast cells in fig show that the cell size and morphology are preserved no cell denaturing or fragmentation due to the saw radiation is evident preliminary tests using flow cytometry to sort the live and dead yeast as well as primary murine osteoblast cells together with absorbance spectra from standard colorimetric assays mtt or fluorescence assays from the uptake of alamar blue both indicators of chemical reduction in the growth medium and hence the proliferation ability of the post saw seeded cells indicate little effect of the saw irradiation on cell viability and growth figs d similar saw driven drop actuation mechanisms have also been used for open microfluidic systems for dna amplification via polymerase chain reaction pcr and hybridization drops carrying the pcr reagents are transported on hydrophobically coated surface similar to that used in the particle collection concentration and cell seeding applications described above merged at an intersection and then subsequently moved to position above an on chip resistive heater to initiate the pcr reaction for subsequent hybridization the drop containing the pcr product is translated using the saw to another position on the chip above second heater where matched and mismatched oligonucleotides are spotted besides drop translation the saw can also be used to induce mixing to enhance the pcr reaction we will discuss saw driven mixing strategies in subsequent sections pumping and mixing instead of free drop actuation in open microfluidic systems the saw can also be used to pump liquid through microchannels in ref poly dimethylsiloxane pdms microchannel was mounted onto the saw substrate as shown in fig whereas in refs and microchannel was laser ablated into the substrate as shown in fig as with the saw driven drop transport the micropumping velocities achieved are extremely high on the order cm which is one to two decades larger than that possible with electrokinetic micropumps moreover peculiar attribute of the acoustic propagation in the fluid contained in the microchannel facilitates the ability to switch between uniform through flow for fluid delivery and vortex laden flows figure shows uniform fluid flow through m microchannel however when the channel width was increased while holding the input power and the saw frequency constant the flow becomes progressively irregular as shown in figs d more specifically we observe uniform fluid flow when f where is the sound wavelength at the excitation frequency of the saw in the fluid as increases beyond vortices with characteristic length scales between and develop with an increasingly oscillatory flow structure the vortices arise as consequence of the sound waves irradiated from the sidewalls since the transverse motions of the solid elements along the sidewalls are completely out of phase the standing wave arising as consequence of the superpositioning of the irradiated sound waves from the sidewalls of the microchannel can only occur if f and n where given the transition from uniform through flow in fig to the oscillatory behavior exhibited in figs d can be attributed to symmetry breaking of the instantaneous transverse velocity field it then becomes clear why the transition is observed when f in any case the ability to rapidly switch between uniform through flow and oscillatory vortical flows demonstrate the possibility for interchanging between pumping and mixing in the same microchannel simply by altering the saw frequency thus eliminating the elaborate architectures or separate components to induce mixing that are typically required in conventional microfluidic systems interestingly if the fluid consisted of suspension of colloidal particles particle assembly also takes place in the regions where the fluid is quiescent for example near the bottom of the microchannel as shown in fig linear particle arrangements assemble at the nodes of the pressure field corresponding with the first order fluid motion arising due to the compressibility of the sound waves that are radiated into the fluid note the correspondence between the number of nodal lines and the number of aligned particle assemblies specifically the number of particle collection lines is the integer number of nodal lines with separation that fit within the given channel width this then offers specific tunability of the number of particle assemblies either through the selection of the channel dimension the fluid or the saw excitation frequency which has important implications for particle sorting in microfluidic channels particular scheme for microchannel particle focusing using this principle is offered by shi et al an area that has received little attention so far within microfluidics has been microcentrifugation understandably this is due to the difficulty in generating sufficient centrifugal forces at small scales to overcome the fluid resistance as consequence of the dominance of surface forces that overwhelm body forces due to the inverse length scaling of the surface area to volume ratio strategies to drive effective recirculatory or centrifugal flows in microdevices are therefore required in an initial conception small scale centrifugation was driven through coriolis forces by rotating an entire disk similar in size to compact disk cd on which fluidic channels and components were fabricated this has recently been exploited for separating plasma from whole blood while quite effective for its desired purpose such bulk rotation of the entire cd structure which in itself is relatively large can however be cumbersome expensive and unreliable quite the antithesis of microfluidic philosophy moreover the rotation of the entire structure is also nonspecific e all components on the cd are rotated this is severe limitation as there are components upstream or downstream of the reactor or separator for example the dispensation and detection components in which rotation may produce undesirable effects while it may be possible to isolate merely the reactor and separator to the rotated disk integration of the rotated structure with the other stationary structures together with fluid connections can be extremely difficult which is again quite contrary to microfluidic philosophy in which integration of all fluid processing components onto single chip based device is an end goal this first concept of microcentrifuge without requiring the bulk rotation of the entire fluidic chamber or any other mechanically moving parts employed ionic wind generated through the application of large electric field to sharp electrode tip held above circular microfluidic chamber to drive bulk air flow which then resulted in fluid recirculation on the surface and consequently beneath the surface in the bulk of the liquid within the chamber through interfacial shear this mechanism was demonstrated as an effective micromixer as well as mechanism to separate or concentrate particles for example the separation of red blood cells from blood plasma the use of high voltage electric fields and air flows are however impractical for large number of microfluidic systems similar microcentrifugatory flow can be generated using saws through symmetry breaking of the acoustic wave propagation across the substrate this can be achieved through various means as shown in fig thus giving rise to azimuthal acoustic streaming within the fluid drop on the substrate to intensify the azimuthal recirculation it is possible to employ electric width controlled single phase unidirectional transducer spudt electrodes in place of the conventional idt design unlike the conventional idt designs which are bidirectional e saws are produced both to the front and rear of the idts internally tuned reflectors within the idt fingers in the spudt electrode design generates unidirectional saw that propagates from only one side of the idt furthermore the saw intensity can be increased by focusing the spudt using curved electrodes as shown in fig the corresponding saw pattern visualized through laser doppler vibrometry or simply through smoke particle patterns generated by the saw on the substrate can be seen in figs and respectively whichever idt is used the strong azimuthal streaming within the drop at typical linear velocities of around mm with the conventional idts and as high as mm with the focusing spudts can be exploited to drive intense micromixing or rapid particle separation concentration shilton et al has shown that the chaoticlike inertial flow induced by the saw provides means for driving effective turbulent like mixing with an enhancement ratio deff that scales roughly as where deff is the effective diffusivity is the diffusivity in the absence of flow and is the power in ref small amount of food dye is shown to be completely mixed in glycerine water drop in under if the drop is suspended with micro nanoparticles instead particle concentration or separation can be effected in related manner as shown in fig in which the particles are continuously drawn into closed azimuthal streamlines and recirculate within the streamline until critical closed packing fraction is reached beyond which shear gradients induce cross streamline transport causing the particles to migrate towards the center of the vortex structure unlike the ionic wind driven microcentrifugation which requires several minutes for example for the blood cells to concentrate and hence the plasma layer to be separated the saw driven inertial microcentrifugatory flow occurs in under besides blood plasma separation as requisite precursor stage for blood diagnostics on microfluidic platform the mechanism also constitutes rapid preconcentration step for example to facilitate easier and faster pathogen detection in microfluidic biosensors another salient attribute of the azimuthal flow permits further microfluidic manipulation li et al report an optimum rf power input for concentration beyond which the increasingly intense acoustic streaming drives strong inertial convection which then overwhelms shear diffusion such that the particles redisperse this therefore offers the capability of controlled particle concentration and dispersion at will recently discovered saw jetting phenomenon offers further exciting possibilities for wider range of microfluidic applications this was demonstrated by tan et al who used two elliptical focusing spudts at two opposite ends of the substrate to drive the convergence of two saws at point above which liquid drop is placed the transmission of radiation at the rayleigh angle into the liquid from both the front and rear sides of the drop causes it to deform into coherent elongated liquid column as observed in fig such jetting phenomena without requiring fluid confinement mechanisms such as nozzles or orifices to accelerate the fluid to adequately sufficient velocities requisite to produce elongated jets demonstrates the ability for the saw to drive strong inertial forcing on liquid that is unique in microfluid flows in any case the jets observed here present opportunities for ink jet or soft biological printing and fiber synthesis among other applications in the latter the inability of the saw to denature biomolecules represent an advantage over other techniques that involve high shear or large electrical currents the rich dynamics of the saw jetting phenomenon is captured in fig in which we observe the jet length and the ability to initiate single droplet or even multiple droplet ejection the former due to tip pinch off and the latter as consequence of the axisymmetric breakup of the cylindrical jet column associated with the classical rayleigh plateau instability to depend on the jet weber number defined as wej uj rj where is the fluid density uj is the jet velocity rj is the jet radius and is the interfacial tension at high powers the displacement velocity of the substrate as the saw passes along its surface is typically s irrespective of the excitation frequency given the nm order amplitude of the saw the surface acceleration is therefore extremely large on the order of s these huge accelerations in turn induce strong capillary waves at the free surface of the drop which when sufficiently strong to overcome the capillary stress destabilizes the interface and leads to atomization of the drop the atomized droplets are highly monodisperse and around in size roughly insensitive to the saw frequency due to the viscous damping of the drop in which case the capillary waves at the free surface of the drop vibrate at frequency associated with viscous capillary resonance if the drop prior to atomization were to however spread into film that is thinner than the thickness of the compressional boundary layer adjacent to the substrate approximately for water where inertial effects are dominant due to the extremely large surface acceleration off the substrate the free surface of the film undulates at frequency associated with inertial capillary resonance in which case the atomized droplets may be below this inertial film destabilization can be exploited for producing regular spatially homogeneous polymer spot patterns as will be discussed subsequently whichever the case saw atomization presents rapid and simple technique for the generation of micron and submicron aerosol droplets for wide range of industrial processes such as ink jet printing agricultural spraying fuel injection pulmonary drug delivery and dna microarray printing we note that the monodispersed micron order droplets are particularly well suited for pulmonary drug delivery in which order aerosol drops are typically prescribed for optimum dose efficiency in order to deliver the maximum amount of drug to the lower respiratory airways for direct local administration to target organs the power required for atomization around is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that of ultrasonic atomizers that employ langevin transducers and single lead zirconium titanate element thickness mode piston atomizers which operate in the khz mhz frequency range another advantage of the saw atomization technique as with the jetting phenomena discussed above is the ability to do away with nozzles and orifices thus simplifying considerably the device and hence reducing its costs and increasing its reliability the technique can also be used as straightforward method for generating biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles simply by atomizing solvent drop in which the polymeric excipient is dissolved the subsequent in flight evaporation of the atomized solvent droplets then leaves behind solidified polymeric particles which are relatively monodispersed due to the rapid temperature quenching that arises as consequence of the high drop ejection velocities the nonuniform surface evaporation that occurs results in spatial inhomogeneities in the polymer solvent concentration and ultimately the production of nm spherical clusters comprising sub nm particulates these clusters resemble grape bunches as illustrated in the schematic in fig in any case the one step process for synthesizing these nanoparticles constitutes an attractive alternative to the slow and cumbersome multistep conventional methods g spray drying nanoprecipitation emulsion photocross linking etc alvarez et al also demonstrated the saw atomization process to be useful for generating nm order protein insulin nanoparticles as well as aerosol droplets for inhalation therapy furthermore it is possible to load the protein and other therapeutic molecules into the biodegradable polymer nanoparticle shells as vehicle for controlled release drug delivery the encapsulation of the drug within the biodegradable polymer essentially shields the drug from rapid hydrolysis and degradation allowing sustained release over time thus prolonging the effect of the drug over longer periods whilst preventing dangerous dose spikes encapsulation is typically delicate procedure that can damage the protein during the process through denaturization or aggregation nevertheless preliminary tests have indicated the viability of the protein after saw atomization especially at the high frequencies employed in the same way that saw irradiation does not affect the viability and proliferation of stem cells as discussed previously in sec ii in addition the saw atomization offers the potential for the controlled production of regular long range spatially ordered polymer spot patterns without requiring physical chemical substrate templating or other surface treatment procedures the self organization of these polymer patterns involves two step procedure as shown in figs and the translation of drop containing the polymer solution leaves behind thin trailing film which simultaneously destabilizes consequently the violent free surface vibrations causes thinning at the antinodes of the standing saw vibration on and transverse to the substrate resulting in the depletion of the film at these positions this is compounded by the evaporation of the solvent the rate of which is locally enhanced where there is significant film thinning the breakup of the film across the entire substrate surface at the antinodal positions both axially and transversely and the subsequent solvent evaporation then produces evenly spaced solidified polymer droplets as shown in figs and we note the dependence of the pattern periodicity as well as the polymer spot size on lone parameter namely the saw frequency or wavelength as observed in fig therefore endowing the process with the ability for controllability and fine tuning which is key advantage over other conventional patterning methods the wide and varied range of fluid actuation and particle manipulation capabilities discussed above reveal the enormous potential for the use of saws in micro nanofluidics although there are many advantages with the use of saws including its low cost ease of fabrication scaleability simplicity and efficiency its biggest assets are its ability to drive extremely fast motion one to two orders of magnitude faster than that currently capable with other microfluidic actuation mechanisms and strong inertial motion which is not possible in most microfluidic devices given the infancy of saw microfluidics we expect significant growth in interest as well as research in this area in the coming decade in similar way to which electrokinetics has progressed to date we note in particular that saw sensors and to lesser extent saw biosensors are already at mature development stage see for example ballantine et al and nge et al which is reason why we have deliberately refrained from discussion on these in this article such technology therefore offers tremendous opportunities for the integration of saw microfluidic and saw sensor platforms for miniature chemical and biological sensing we expect that this will constitute significant body of research effort in the near future once the saw microfluidic technology progressively matures in the meantime however much is left to be done both in terms of acquiring deeper fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that govern the saw driven fluid and particle interaction as well as developing robust integrated microfluidic platform for specific lab on chip applications in the former new fluid phenomena continue to be discovered which require further rigorous investigation to elucidate the complex nonlinear fluid structural interactions and physicochemical hydrodynamics underlying the processes observed for example there is yet to be an extensive understanding of the complicated three dimensional flow behavior associated with acoustic streaming in sessile drop let alone the added complexity of acoustic radiation and hydrodynamic effects on particles suspended within the drop how drops translate under the saw forcing and in particular the dynamics in the advancing and receding contact line region are also not well understood moreover thorough comprehension of the free surface behavior of the drop or film excited by the saw underneath it remains elusive although progress has been made to understand the mechanisms governing the vibrations occurring at the free surface see for example qi et al detailed theoretical model that captures the capillary wave excitation and destabilization leading towards droplet pinch off and jetting is urgently needed significant challenges arise however posed by the large length and time scale separation between the saw wavelength and frequency with the characteristic length and period associated with the hydrodynamics thus rendering the numerics associated with the problem extremely stiff on the development aspect the requirement of the piezoelectric substrate presents significant limitation to the material in which the device can be fabricated from fortunately recent results have hinted at the possibility with the aid of fluid layer atop the piezoelectric substrate of coupling the saw radiation through superstrate while retaining the possibility for driving similar fluidic actuation and particle manipulation albeit in drop placed on the superstrate the superstrate itself could consist of typical materials from which microfluidic chips are fabricated for example silicon or pdms thus decoupling the saw driving circuit from the microfluidic device this is an exciting possibility since the more expensive saw device could be reused whereas the cheaper microfluidic circuits which eventually become contaminated with for example biological samples can be disposed of after use the acoustic radiation as it evolves through the fluid coupling layer the superstrate and the fluid atop the superstrate however needs to be further characterized  a method to reconstruct full three dimensional photofragment distributions from their two dimensional projection onto detection plane is presented for processes in which the expanding newton sphere has cylindrical symmetry around an axis parallel to the projection plane the method is based on onion peeling in polar coordinates zhao et al rev sci instrum in which the contribution to the projection from events outside the plane bisecting the newton sphere are subtracted in polar coordinates at incrementally decreasing radii and ideas borrowed from the basis set expansion pbasex method in polar coordinates garcia et al rev sci instrum which we use to generate projections at each incremental radius for the subtraction our method is as good as the pbasex method in terms of accuracy is devoid of centerline noise common to reconstruction methods employing cartesian coordinates and it is computationally cheap allowing images to be reconstructed as they are being acquired in typical imaging experiment photofragment imaging has become one of the most important experimental techniques in the study of gas phase molecular dynamics as it provides simple method to determine the velocity vector of photofragments be it ions neutrals or electrons experimentally the expanding newton sphere impinges onto position sensitive detector typically achieved by accelerating the output from pair of multichannel plates onto phosphor screen and using charge coupled device ccd to capture the image produced for products that appear with cylindrical symmetry which is the case with the majority of photodissociation photoionization and reactive scattering experiments placement of the detector parallel to this symmetry plane ensures that only this symmetry is collapsed in the subsequent projection the use of charged particle imaging in particular has become wide spread with the advent of velocity map imaging vmi in which the velocity components are focused onto specific point on the detector regardless of the initial position in space in this scheme gridless wiley mclaren type electrode arrangement produces an electrostatic lens which can be constructed to provide focal plane at the detector vmi is an indispensable experimental tool and has been used in wide variety of applications in addition to the measurement of both speed and angular distributions of photofragments major advantage of charged particle imaging is its steradian collection of charged particles and the overall detection efficiency is only limited by the efficiency of the detector however under low signal level conditions the effective efficiency in terms of obtaining speed or angular distribution is much less this loss arises from the reduction in dimensionality in the projection of the three dimensional expanding newton sphere onto two dimensional detector in order to reconstruct the distribution either mathematical reconstruction or the use of elegant slice imaging techniques is required in the latter only the center slice through the expanding distribution is detected however such experiments are generally more involved and very challenging for light particles such as photoelectrons the loss of efficiency is exasperated for photoelectron spectroscopy where the use of the magnetic bottle allows for near unit efficiency in producing photoelectron spectrum although the loss of angular information and of sensitivity at low speeds make this method restrictive in general the direct provision of the speed distribution through time of flight methods is very attractive as it provides instant feedback during data acquisition daq in contrast the visual inspection of d image during daq often does not provide the user with information on the quality of speed or angular distributions this is in part because at large radii the signal appears weaker while the center of the image typically is very bright additionally the image contains the cylindrically symmetric azimuthal contribution which carries no useful information as result the observation of small signal in congested regions of radial spectrum can be difficult as is the case for example in time resolved photoelectron imaging hence access to the radial spectrum during daq allows user to optimize signals and determine the quality of spectrum without the need for using an off line reconstruction method motivated by this restriction we present an image reconstruction routine based on polar onion peeling pop allowing real time image processing while retaining the accuracy of other reconstruction methods in order to recover the speed and angular distributions from photofragment images range of analytical image reconstruction methods have been developed most of which have been reviewed in ref mathematically the projection of the distribution onto d plane can be done through the abel integral and thus numerical inverse abel methods can be used to reconstruct the distribution from measured image of which the fourier hankel algorithm is most commonly employed however the inverse abel integral is cumbersome and robust method to circumvent its use directly is to employ basis set functions with analytically known inverse abel transforms this basis set expansion basex method is accurate and can handle relatively noisy images and as result has been widely adopted variation in this method pbasex uses polar basis set functions in which the basis sets include the legendre polynomials to which the angular distributions of the photofragments are fitted this has the advantage of producing reconstructed image in which the centerline noise generated in most reconstruction methods is restricted to the center spot of the image additionally reconstructed images are naturally smoothed particularly angularly so that the images are visually very attractive pbasex is computationally fast compared to basex inverse abel methods and the method of vrakking which iteratively calculates the projection based on some initial guess recent method based on cross validation and iterative regularization combines features of both basex and the iterative method another approach to the reconstruction problem is the so called onion peeling method the basic premise is that the intensity of given point on the detector has contribution from the dependence of the original distribution see fig in cartesian coordinates this can be calculated along the decreasing direction and removed as long as there is cylindrical symmetry around additionally the energy of the photoproduct must be much less than the energy gained in the detection so that the contribution along has relatively simple solution although this restriction has been overcome its solution is nontrivial particularly for nonhomogenous electric acceleration fields as is the case in vmi the onion peeling method is appealing because it is intuitively simple and computationally very fast however in cartesian coordinates it suffers from error accumulation because one must start at the outermost point on the detector where the signal is smallest due to the jacobian in going from spherical coordinates the laser matter interaction system to cartesian the detection system this problem can be alleviated by onion peeling in polar coordinates in which the error at large radii is reduced and error accumulation is not major concern additionally it relaxes the need for high kinetic energy at the detector with respect to the initial energy like pbasex and the iterative methods pop reduces the centerline noise to spot at the center of the image however pop as currently developed is slow thus loosing lot of onion peeling appeal additionally pop has not been directly compared to other methods and onion peeling in general is perceived to be inferior to basex and many other methods in terms of accuracy and its handling of noise in this article we overcome the limitations of computational speed of pop by employing the basis set concepts of basex our method is computationally cheap and an intuitively simple reconstruction method for on the fly image reconstruction during daq additionally we show that pop is as accurate as pbasex and has certain important advantages over the latter the next section describes the method along with computational details in sec iii the method is compared with other methods for images with low signal to noise levels and large variations in the intensities of features it is also tested on an experimentally obtained image section iv presents summary with reference fig consider d radial distribution r that is cylindrically symmetric around the axis for photoionization and photodissociation experiments the axis will correspond to the radiation polarization vector in charged particle imaging r is mapped onto the plane parallel to producing the measured distribution r for charged particles emitted with radial speed distribution described by delta function the image r has signal at radii smaller than the radius defined by the velocity of the photoproducts e at r this signal originates from the dependence of the charged particle cloud which may be calculated and subtracted away from r for all r leaving only the radial delta function at r the resultant distribution is equivalent to slice through the distribution r and from this the full distribution can be recovered because of the inherent cylindrical symmetry around the axis of r in the case of broad or congested radial distributions the same strategy holds the projection r can be expressed as the sum of the individual projections r for all components of the full distribution r r rmaxg r dr where r and the semicolon in r is used to indicate that the projections are given at specific radii analogous to the case of the radial delta function r can be recovered by removing the contributions of for r starting at rmax and incrementally decreasing in steps of dr until is reached at each g r is subtracted from r which effectively peels away the contributions at each hence this method has been termed onion peeling and it is particularly intuitive in polar coordinates pop was first introduced by zhao et al who also present thorough discussion of the benefits of onion peeling in polar over cartesian coordinates the method presented here is in essence equivalent however the main restriction of their method has been its computational expense and general applicability the cause of this arises from the need to simulate d distribution at each radial increment the projection of this gfit r is then used in the subtraction our method fundamentally differs from that of zhao et al in how gfit r is generated in order to retain the low computational expense of onion peeling we borrow ideas from the basex methods in which basis sets are used in order to fit the experimental data in similar spirit the pop method described here uses the concept of basis sets to allow for very efficient calculation of gfit r as described in sec ii in practice the original cartesian distribution is converted to polar coordinates by mapping the cartesian grid defined by the ccd onto polar array in order to retain similar amount of information in polar coordinates the polar pixel is chosen to be of similar size as the cartesian pixel see fig as the differential area remains the same the number of polar pixels required to define given will scale as for quadrant of the cartesian image this equates to the integer part of the signal in polar pixel is defined by rotating the polar pixel by about its pivot its fractional overlap with the four surrounding cartesian pixels and their respective signal intensity is then used to calculate the polar pixel intensity the resulting raw polar image r is thus triangular array because the number of angles at which pixels can be defined scales linearly with although not the traditional representation of d image we believe that it provides much more convenient and intuitive display as one can simply read off the radial distribution along the axis and the angular distribution by comparing the signal levels along the angular axis the main source of error in our conversion arises from the assumption that the polar pixel has the same dimensions as the cartesian pixel this becomes less pronounced as increases and because the onion peeling peels from the outer radius inwards the errors are not cumulative and only present problem at small however the noise introduced by the reconstruction method is also greatest at small thus noise accumulation only occurs at small and the noise introduced by the polar conversion is not significant the raw polar image r corresponds to the sum over all components as defined in eq as long as there is no signal at radii larger than the detector the outermost ring contains no contribution from and the substitution r h at r is valid starting at the outermost radius rmax is fitted to the well known angular distribution n n r pn cos where pn cos is the nth order legendre polynomial the fit provides r an intensity factor and r the anisotropy parameters the integer is determined by the physics of the process the fitting can be performed using standard linear least squares methods such as singular value decomposition as used in pbasex in general our concern is primarily with one or two photon processes hence at present our program only fits up to where the fit is performed directly from r and r the distribution gfit rmax may be calculated which is then subtracted from r for all rmaxg g gfit r r is modified image containing r for rmax the process is incrementally repeated for rmax dr until is reached upon completion r represents d image of all the residuals from the subtraction the slice r is constructed by retaining r in eq at each increment note that either the experimental r or the fitted hfit may be used to reconstruct r the choice does not affect the ultimate radial spectrum produced however the latter smoothes angular noise in similar manner as pbasex does and presents visually very attractive images however it also discards real experimental angular noise in the interest of computational expense direct numerical simulation of gfit r is avoided as it is time consuming and is the main limitation to the speed of the routine the approach taken here uses ideas from basex in which basis functions are used in order to fit the experimental data for basis functions pop uses idealized radial distribution functions br produced by angular integration of perfectly isotropic images to retain consistency with the experimental image acquisition the basis functions are generated by simulating images at given onto cartesian grid transforming to polar form using the method described in sec ii and integrating over angle the basis set r is constructed from basis functions generated at all possible and r is consequently d triangular array all basis functions are normalized such that the intensity at r is unity importantly r is generated once using stand alone program and then supplied to the reconstruction routine the overall size of the basis set r is determined by the size of the ccd in terms of pixels as used in the experiment and it can readily be extended to subpixel resolution attainable through centroiding of events during the pop routine the relevant basis function br is retrieved from the r basis set which is called into memory only once at the start of the routine or daq run and remains in memory for the entire duration of the daq an idealized perfectly isotropic polar image gideal r is then constructed from br usinggideal r r br the number of polar pixels at each described in fig along with their associated intensities is reintroduced to gideal r through the factor r numerically r is defined as the ratio of the number of polar pixels at to and accounts for the fact that in the polar image the number of polar pixels changes with respect to i the polar image is d triangular array the idealized image gfit r with experimentally observed anisotropy and intensity is then generated throughgfit r gideal r r n pn rrcos where the parameters r and r have been obtained from the fitting of the outer ring r to eq the factor r accounts for the transformation of coordinate system from and to and as represented in fig the image gfit r generated through eq is identical to that produced via the method implemented by zhao et al but has avoided direct simulation of the image as part of the reconstruction resulting in much more efficient algorithm the basis set used in our pop algorithm depends on the experimental resolution of the image captured for given ccd single r can be generated in contrast the basis functions in basex and pbasex are defined by the width of the gaussian function used which affects the reconstructed distribution and consequently introduces an additional parameter pop subtracts the contribution to each ring successively ultimately leading to the slice r this is valid if the radial width of each increment tends to zero e dr pixilation of the image by the ccd means that at every subtraction some component is not accounted for over the pixel width dr resulting in the retention of slice r similar pixilation effects have been noted in cartesian onion peeling figure explores the general functionality of the missing component images with single pixel width radial feature at various have been simulated using the same number of events reconstructed and the resulting radial spectrum scaled using the usual sin in fig the ratio of the peak intensity at fixed arbitrarily chosen as to the peak intensity at varying is plotted as function of where the different symbols correspond to different anisotropy parameters of the image if the slice r contains no component then the ratio should be unity and independent of with reference to fig the missing component at given is perpendicular to the plane along the direction and its area will depend on to first approximation the component can be described as triangle in the xy plane the area of which is proportional to rdr this scaling is shown in fig with dr as solid line despite the rather rough approximation it appears to capture the behavior very well particularly at large the observed dependence at small originates from the dependence on the omitted volume and can in principle be accounted for however in practice this is cumbersome and ultimately presents only small error and only at small where noise is naturally accumulated using polar reconstruction methods thus in order to reconstruct the full distribution from the r slice r sin scaling is used instead of the usual sin which accurately recovers the full distribution pop of sample our primary motivation for developing pop stems from the desire to observe the radial distribution in conjunction with daq in typical experiment daq does not require the read out of the ccd at every shot specifically most ultrafast pump probe experiments operate at khz which far exceeds the read out rate from most ccds hence often the ccd is exposed for several shots and data transferred at hz or less because this timescale is comparable to that required for pop reconstruction may be done in parallel to daq providing direct feedback on the progress of the experiment we demonstrate the point by simulating radial spectrum in typical time resolved photoelectron imaging experiment typically electron shot is collected at khz for single photon features features and in fig while pump probe signal is often an order of magnitude less probable feature in fig images in the first column of fig are simulated by randomly sampling d distribution of photoproducts with predetermined anisotropy parameters and gaussian radial distributions this is then projected onto cartesian grid representing the ccd the three processes labeled peaks b and in fig correspond to radial distributions centered at and and anisotropy parameters of and respectively also included are electrons shot of random events on the cartesian grid to simulate the effect of white noise the first row in fig shows the simulation after only of daq corresponding to electrons in peaks and the central column represents r following pop and retaining hfit this is displayed in polar coordinates as the triangular array described in sec ii where the diagonal corresponds to the angle for clarity negative values arising from over subtraction have been set to zero in the display despite the low signal level features and can be clearly identified in the final column the corresponding radial spectrum is presented along with three point running average peaks and can be readily identified and hence optimized during daq at hz rate the second row shows the same data but after collection e electrons in and although it is now also clear from the raw cartesian image that there are two distinct rings the radial spectrum shows the additional presence of feature which is not immediately apparent from the raw image at larger radii the effects of the counts of random cartesian noise result in rising baseline and an oscillation near the detection edge these arise as the cartesian noise does not posses contributions as result the first increment over subtracts which is compensated for in the next iteration leading to an oscillation in the fit parameter r after the radial distribution shows clearly all the features present and r provides convenient visual aide to the anisotropy of features and after corresponding to counts in and the effect of smoothing is no longer noticeable figure highlights the benefit of direct access to the radial spectrum as data is collected even small signals may be observed allowing real time optimization of experimental parameters additionally instant information about the quality of the spectrum is provided it can be seen that after of collection the spectrum may be of acceptable quality whereas after it is not and at the improving signal to noise is no longer noticeable in many cases the angular distribution is the observable of interest although r provides visually attractive image and shows the anisotropy clearly it must be remembered that this is fit and provides no information about the quality of that fit during daq pop can provide convenient measure of the confidence in the measured parameters in fig for example the standard deviation in from the fit in eq can be calculated directly at pixel it is and after and respectively hence pop allows the determination of when target confidence level is reached more generally the residuals array r defined in eq can be used to set general predetermined criteria for the quality of an image and its reconstruction in figs and we compare the accuracy of pop against other commonly used methods specifically we have chosen to compare primarily to pbasex as garcia et al provide thorough evaluation of pbasex relative to the commonly used methods of basex and the abel inverse in general pbasex performs better than the abel inverse while it is comparable to basex except for images where the anisotropy parameters possess noneven integer values of for which pbasex outperforms basex figure shows simulated image in which total number of events have been randomly generated based on predefined angular and radial gaussian distributions the angular parameters used for the simulation have been defined in table in addition counts of cartesian noise have also been added the reconstructed slice from pop is shown in fig where the measured r is retained to show the true nature of the measured noise from the raw image this is in contrast to fig and pbasex which only show fit to the data and as result these do not provide any indication of the quality of the angular image because noneven integer values of are used for the anisotropy parameters the angle spanned by the r is now and is shown in fig in fig the recovered radial distribution normalized to the total integrated intensity is shown along with that obtained using pbasex and the expected radial distribution based on the input parameters of the simulation both methods are able to reproduce the radial positions to subpixel resolution similarly the extracted parameters presented in table are accurate to less than one decimal place in both cases the major noticeable difference in the spectra of fig is the peak intensities of the peaks around which is highlighted in the inset pop appears to do better in terms of absolute peak height and width reproducing the expected distribution more closely than pbasex the other noticeable difference is that the baseline noise between features is less for pbasex which is consequence of the radial width of the gaussian function contained in the basis set which essentially smoothes the image in fig an experimentally measured image has been reconstructed using pop and pbasex to provide the radial spectra shown the image measured by the bellm and reid has been produced by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization from the ground state via the vibrational level in the state in para difluorobenzene this particular image was chosen as it was used as direct comparison to time of flight data and was also used by garcia et al in their evaluation of pbasex fig in ref with respect to the abel inverse and basex methods table iii in ref radial spectra obtained using either pop or pbasex produce very similar results both in terms of peak positions and intensities the anisotropy parameters extracted from pop can be compared directly with those presented by garcia et al and bellm and reid and are shown in table ii pop obtains consistent values with other methods including the time of flight measurements of bellm and reid the computational speed of pop scales as for image pop takes on pc with ghz processor the speed of the algorithm can be further improved in number of ways for example the cartesian to polar image conversion producing r can be binned into larger or intervals the binning in larger intervals is particularly useful the effective box car averaging over only has minor effect on the angular fit to eq the anisotropy parameters will be slightly underestimated which can be compensated for particularly when low order anisotropy terms are required the increase in computational speed would scale linearly in this case binning in larger intervals would increase the speed significantly e pixel bin would lead to fold increase in computation speed however this would also lead to loss of radial resolution which may or may not be major concern depending on specific applications generally if pop is used as diagnostic tool during daq rebinning in larger bins is ideal and allows for true real time image processing during daq our code has been developed as drop in subroutine in labview most coding has however been written using language syntax within formula node interface for clarity and versatility to any potential user the labview platform allows for parallelization of the daq and image reconstruction using dual core processor common to most modern pcs the source code is freely available both as drop in sub vi and as c syntax code which can easily be adapted and incorporated in daq systems very attractive feature of the current method is that it is intuitive simple and accessible to experimentalists in summary we have developed method to reconstruct the full distribution from its projection as measured in velocity map imaging experiments it is based on the method of zhao et al which performs an onion peeling of the projection in polar coordinates but has been greatly improved in terms of computational speed by using basis set of radial distribution functions which allow for the efficient calculation of projections required in the onion peeling subtraction as result pop can be used for the reconstruction of the full newton sphere alongside daq in typical experiments providing user with instant on the fly access to the one dimensional radial and angular spectra rather than the convoluted image this is particularly useful in applications where signals are small or obscured by large backgrounds or in applications requiring long daq times both of which are often the case in time resolved experiments despite the improvements in computational speed the quality of the reconstruction is comparable to the widely used pbasex method  by systematically comparing the magnetic properties of the ta cofeb ta and mgo cofeb mgo structures with and without submonolayer of mgo ta nb hf and inserted in the middle of the cofeb layer we have proved that the observed perpendicular magnetic anisotropy pma in ta cofeb mgo sandwiches is solely originated from the cofeb mgo interface with the ta buffer acting to enhance the cofeb mgo interface anisotropy significantly moreover replacing ta with hf causes the cofeb mgo interfacial pma further enhanced by and the cofeb layer with perpendicular magnetization has much larger critical thickness accordingly leaving wider thickness margin for the cofeb mgo based perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction optimization also the sputter deposited thin hf films are amorphous with low surface roughness these results will ensure the hf cofeb mgo more promising material system for pma device development magnetic tunnel junctions mtjs with ferromagnetic electrodes possessing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy pma have attracted great deal of attention in recent years such mtjs combine several important advantages over the mtjs with in plane anisotropy e higher energy barrier against thermal agitation at reduced dimensions due to larger anisotropy energy and smaller critical current density and faster reversal speed for current induced magnetization switching cims due to the absence of the demagnetization term so far most of the available pma materials have been explored as mtj electrodes including the rare earth transition metal alloys ordered co fe pt pd alloys and co pt pd ni multilayers attempts have also been made to search for strong pma in co or cofeb layers sandwiched by pd pt and mgo or other oxides layers however all these material systems suffer from either difficulties in integrating them into mtjs with high magnetoresistance ratio or insufficient chemical thermal stability or large critical current needed for cims due to their large gilbert damping constant real breakthrough is the discovery of appreciable interfacial pma in the widely adopted ta cofeb mgo films for conventional in plane mtjs and by incorporating this interfacial pma high performance perpendicular mtjs have been demonstrated further study showed that electric field can be used to assist magnetization switching by reducing the current density by two orders of magnitude in the perpendicular ta cofeb mgo based mtjs these exciting findings represent the significant steps towards the next generation spintronic devices however for practical device development the interfacial pma in the ta cofeb mgo system is insufficient to some extent it will not only limit the device density scalability but also challenge the layer deposition and mtj fabrication technique considering the ultrathin cofeb layer with very narrow tunable thickness range physically whether the ta cofeb interface contributes to pma in the ta cofeb mgo system is still an open question although the presence of pma at cofeb mgo interface is widely accepted ikeda et al first ascribed the observed pma in ta cofeb mgo to the contribution of the cofeb mgo interface wang et al further claimed that the pma in ta cofeb mgo structure was totally originating from the cofeb mgo interface based on the observation that pma only developed when mgo thickness exceeded nm however worledge et al asserted that the ta cofeb interface also introduces substantial pma judging from the fact that the ta cofeb mgo films have an appreciably larger pma than the ru cofeb mgo films in this paper we demonstrated that the pma in ta cofeb mgo sandwich structure solely comes from the cofeb mgo interface yet the ta buffer essentially enhances cofeb mgo interface anisotropy significantly furthermore replacing the ta buffer by hf can cause an increase in the cofeb mgo interfacial pma by as much as leading to wider cofeb thickness margin for perpendicular mtj optimization in addition similar to the ta buffer the sputter deposited thin hf films also possess amorphous structure with small surface roughness which can be very beneficial for mgo barrier mtjs by eliminating the harmful template effects existed in the pt or pd cofeb mgo based structures films were deposited on the thermally oxidized si wafers at room temperature by magnetron sputtering the base pressure of the sputtering system was better than pa and working argon pressure was pa three sets of samples have been studied these include ta co fe ta with and without nm mgo layer inserted in the middle of cofeb layer mgo co fe mgo ta with and without dusting layer of ta nb hf and and nm in nominal thickness inserted in the middle of cofeb layer ta or hf co fe mgo ta where the numbers in parentheses are the nominal thickness of the individual layers in nanometers the metal and cofeb films were deposited by dc sputtering while the mgo layer was deposited by rf sputtering up to uniform films were prepared in single deposition run samples were subsequently annealed at for hour in vacuum furnace pa magnetic properties were studied using vibrating sample magnetometer vsm the crystalline structure and surface morphologies were checked by ray diffraction xrd and atomic force microscope afm respectively all presented results are obtained from room temperature measurements on the annealed samples unless otherwise specified to clarify the effect of ta on pma in the ta cofeb mgo structure magnetic properties of the ta co fe ta and the mgo co fe mgo multilayers were studied first the annealed ta co fe ta sandwiches are magnetically soft in the film plane with the areal saturation moment varying linearly with the cofeb thickness from which the magnetic dead layer thickness and saturation magnetization ms of the cofeb layers were determined to be nm and emu cm respectively meanwhile the out of plane magnetization saturation field for all the ta co fe ta samples is about koe equals to ms regardless the cofeb layer thickness apparently neither volume nor interfacial pma presents in the annealed ta cofeb ta sandwiches as for the mgo co fe mgo films the saturation magnetization is almost same as that in ta cofeb ta films without the magnetic dead layer formation besides all mgo cofeb mgo samples also exhibit in plane anisotropy but the perpendicular saturation field is smaller than ms especially for the films with thin cofeb layer as an example fig shows the in plane and perpendicular h curves of the mgo cofeb mgo film note that the film normal direction is the magnetic hard axis with perpendicular saturation field of about koe much smaller than the demagnetizing field koe the effective perpendicular anisotropy keff of the mgo cofeb mgo samples is determined and summarized in fig by fitting the tcofeb dependence of the product of keff and tcofeb through the equation documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation rm eff rm rm pi rm k rm t rm cofeb end equation end document eff kv ms ks cofeb the cofeb volume anisotropy kv is found to be negligible and each cofeb mgo interface has an interfacial anisotropy ks of about erg cm indeed interfacial pma is formed at the two mgo cofeb interfaces but apparently this pma is insufficient to overcome the shape anisotropy from the results obtained above the ta co fe mgo films could be naively inferred to possess in plane anisotropy this is in conflict with the well known experimental fact plausible cause is that in the ta co fe mgo films ta may appreciably enhance the cofeb mgo interfacial pma or vice versa instead of uncorrelated with each other to prove this argument submonolayer of ta nm is inserted into the middle of the cofeb layer for the mgo co fe mgo structure remarkably the ta doped films with tcofeb nm exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy figure displays the h curves obtained from mgo cofeb ta cofeb mgo film the film normal direction is the magnetic easy axis with large in plane saturation field of about koe in contrast to the pure mgo cofeb mgo films the measured keff for the ta doped films is also presented in fig showing significantly enhanced keff with positive value at tcofeb nm the slight deviation of the keff tcofeb product from the straight line at small tcofeb might be due to the deterioration of cofeb mgo interface caused by ta diffusion similar data fitting as performed on the pure mgo cofeb mgo films gives negligible kv and doubled ks erg cm since the sputter deposited submonolayer should be discontinuous by nature it is unlikely that appreciable interfacial pma would occur around such dusting ta atoms this speculation is further supported by the same ks enhancement observed in the samples with the mgo cofeb ta cofeb ta cofeb mgo ta structure therefore ta layers even as thin as nm can significantly increase the cofeb mgo interface anisotropy on the other hand when dusting layer of mgo nm is inserted into the middle of the cofeb layer in the ta co fe ta structure both kv and ks are still negligible this means that the mgo layer has much less or little effect on the cofeb ta interfacial anisotropy it thus can be concluded that the widely observed pma in ta cofeb mgo sandwiches is mostly originated from the cofeb mgo interface with the ta buffer acting to enhance the cofeb mgo interface anisotropy significantly in order to further elucidate the origin of the cofeb mgo interfacial pma enhancement through ta layer across thin cofeb film submonolayer nm in thickness of different elements adjacent to ta in the periodic table including nb hf and has also been inserted into the middle of the cofeb layers in the mgo co fe mgo structure the corresponding ks of each cofeb mgo interface is determined to be and erg cm and kv negligible theory proposed by yang et al suggested that the cofeb mgo interfacial pma comes from the overlap between the pz and transition metal dz orbits with larger spin orbit coupling soc induced splitting around the fermi level for the perpendicular magnetization orientation the soc of the cofe layer can be strengthened by the addition of the heavy elements while the hybridization between cofe and which is related with their electronegativity difference may also be reinforced by the insertion atoms with smaller electronegativity therefore heavier element dusting layer has more appreciable effect on ks enhancement e hf ta nb by sequence and the dusting layer of elements on the left side in the periodic table with smaller electronegativity does likewise e hf ta in effect parenthetically the present method of inserting submonolayer of hf ta and into the cofeb films encapsulated by mgo layers with the magnetization switched to the film normal direction has potential application in mgo based double barrier perpendicular mtjs as noted above the hf insertion layer enhanced the cofeb mgo interfacial anisotropy more effectively than any other dusting layer did it would be expected that the cofeb mgo films grown on an hf buffer layer have larger pma and accordingly thicker cofeb layer with perpendicular magnetization as compared with the currently used ta cofeb mgo films figures and show the representative h curves of the hf co fe tcofeb mgo ta films with the magnetic field applied in plane and perpendicular direction respectively the samples with tcofeb nm have perpendicular magnetization easy axis and the effective perpendicular anisotropy field increases as tcofeb decreases figures and plot the representative h curves for the ta co fe tcofeb mgo ta films prepared under the same condition apparently the critical thickness of the cofeb layer to show perpendicular easy axis is only nm it should be stressed that the significant pma in hf cofeb mgo films has different origin in comparison with that observed in the pd or pt cofeb mgo films for the present case the hf cofeb interface itself does not introduce interfacial pma in contrast to the appreciable interfacial anisotropy at pd or pt cofeb interface in fact the hf cofeb hf films with and without nm mgo dusting layer at the cofeb layer center have also been fabricated and magnetically they do not exhibit any pma component the inset of fig shows the cofeb thickness dependences of the saturation magnetic moment per unit area for the hf and ta buffered samples which coincides with each other the saturation magnetization is determined to be emu cm and magnetically dead layer thickness is zero for both of them such large ms value suggests the well crystallization of the cofeb layers with part of boron absorbed by the hf or ta underlayer as demonstrated by hindmarch et al figure compares the dependence of kefftcofeb on tcofeb for the hf and ta buffered samples since there is no interfacial anisotropy between the cofeb layer and the ta or hf buffer the keff for the ta or hf cofeb mgo films should be written as documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation rm eff rm rm pi rm k rm t rm cofeb end equation end document eff kv ms ks cofeb from the data fitting by using this equation the ks for the hf cofeb mgo and ta cofeb mgo structures is determined to be and erg cm respectively while kv is essentially zero for both of them with the ta buffer replaced by an hf underlayer the pma at the cofeb mgo interface is enhanced by it should be pointed out that the ks for the hf or ta buffered samples is larger than that obtained in the mgo cofeb mgo films with nm hf or ta insertion layer one possibility is the insufficient amount of ta or hf atoms involved in the doped mgo cofeb mgo samples in addition the less crystallization of the cofeb layers reflected by the smaller ms value emu cm obtained in mgo cofeb mgo films with or without the inserting layer may also contribute to the smaller ks as suggested by lee et al in fact gan et al have also found that the cofeb encapsulated by mgo is hard to crystallize during annealing finally the crystal structure and surface morphology of the sputter deposited hf films were characterized by ray diffraction xrd and atomic force microscope afm respectively using in plane grazing incidence ip gid geometry xrd spectra of hf films of various thicknesses with nm ta cover were collected and some representative results are displayed in fig while the thick hf films exhibit appreciable hcp and diffraction peaks the thin hf films thf nm does not have any diffraction peak indicating the amorphous structure of the hf film under nm in thickness the amorphous nature of the buffer layer makes the hf cofeb mgo system superior to the pd or pt buffered cofeb mgo films where the template effect of the oriented pd and pt films deteriorates the orientation of cofeb mgo and thus leads to small tunneling magnetoresistanc ratio figures and show the afm surface topography of the hf co fe mgo and ta co fe mgo respectively both samples have root mean square roughness of about nm in scan area of almost equal to that value of the substrate therefore structurally the hf buffer is as good as the widely adopted ta films for the cofeb mgo based mtjs in summary the observed pma in the ta cofeb mgo sandwiches is solely originated from the cofeb mgo interface with the ta buffer significantly enhancing this cofeb mgo interface anisotropy most important by using an hf underlayer much higher increase perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be achieved for cofeb mgo interface in addition the sputter deposited hf films are amorphous at small thickness with atomically smooth surface these characteristics of the hf cofeb mgo structure can lead to the development of more promising high performance pma devices  biodiesel emulsions are considered as the propitious alternative fuels for diesel engines the need of biodiesel emulsion fuels for the diesel engines is to curtail the dependency on the fossil fuels in context to the world energy oil crisis henceforth the present study provides tangible pathway to prepare and to ameliorate the biodiesel emulsion fuel on incorporating potential alumina nanoparticles the biodiesel emulsion fuel is prepared by emulsification technique comprising of of jatropha biodiesel of water and of surfactants span and tween with the aid of mechanical agitator the prepared biodiesel emulsion fuel is mixed with the alumina nanoparticles in the mass fractions of say and ppm with the help of an ultrasonicator the whole investigation is carried out in constant speed diesel engine in three phases using jatropha biodiesel jatropha biodiesel emulsion fuel and alumina nanoparticle blended jatropha biodiesel emulsion fuels the experimental results revealed substantial enhancement in the performance and reduction in harmful emissions for the biodiesel emulsion fuels compared to those of neat biodiesel in addition the incorporation of nanoparticles in the biodiesel emulsion fuel has also revealed an incremental better performance and reduced emissions than that of biodiesel emulsion fuel and biodiesel furthermore the significance of shorten ignition delay effect associated with the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels has been investigated and asserted upon conducting hot plate evaporation study enhanced global concern due to air pollution caused by the diesel engine has shown much interest in the ecological friendly fuels these forecasts have triggered various research works for the search of alternative sources to replace the fossil fuels in diesel engines in this context the nonedible vegetable oils such as jatropha mahua neem and pongamia and their methyl esters biodiesel are considered as alternative fuels however the direct utilization of vegetable oil in diesel engine is often bounded due to several problems such as high viscosity poor atomization and incomplete combustion on the other hand the methyl esters biodiesel derived from the vegetable oils possess high oxygen content in their molecular structure which in turn leads to the formation of nox nitrogen oxides under high temperature furthermore the emissions of nox are causative for global degradation such as precursors of ozone and acid rain in order to reduce nox and particulate matter emissions from diesel engines emulsification techniques are adopted in this technique water droplets are suspended in the oil layer by suitable surfactant and undergo rapid evaporation of water which in turn avoids the corrosion effect on the engine cylinder surface another benefit of the emulsification technique is the occurrence of microexplosion phenomena where the large fuel droplets break into smaller one and in turn results in vigorous vaporization in the engine cylinder crookes et al carried out an experiment in diesel engine using soya oil and rapeseed oil blended with of water content and observed significant enhancement in thermal efficiency and reduction in nox and smoke emissions the same team have reported an inferior performance for the biofuel emulsion fuels on the account of ignition difficulty and longer ignition delay at the lower loads yoshimoto et al conducted an experimental investigation using vegetable frying oil emulsion fuel with of water content by volume in diesel engine and observed an appreciable reduction in nox smoke and prolonged ignition delay on the other hand the problem of prolonged ignition delay associated with the emulsion fuel leads to the enhancement in premixed combustion phase high heat release rate high cylinder peak pressure and rough engine operation to sort out the problem of prolonged ignition delay some recent works on the fuel modification have been reported on adding potential nanoparticles tyagi et al carried out hot plate ignition probability test and observed that adding aluminum alumina nanoparticles to the diesel fuel will lead to significant enhancement in the ignition temperature and shorter ignition delay kao et al examined an experiment in diesel engine using aluminum

experiment in diesel engine using ceria blended with biodiesel ethanol fuel and observed an improvement in the brake thermal efficiency and significant decrement in the ignition delay and hazardous emissions recently sajith et al utilized ceria nanoadditive with the jatropha biodiesel in single cylinder diesel engine and observed significant reduction of nox and hc and an improvement in the brake thermal efficiency owing to the catalytic action of nanoparticles sadhik basha and anand critically reviewed the published literature related to the applications of nanoparticle nanofluid in the diesel engines and concluded that adding nanoparticles carbon nanotubes to conventional fuels will reduce the evaporation time and favors shorten ignition delay based on the review report on the applications of nanoadditives the same team have studied the effects of carbon nanotubes cnts blended with diesel in single cylinder diesel engine and observed an appreciable enhancement in the brake thermal efficiency and reduced harmful pollutants compared to that of neat diesel operation taking an initiative the same team have extended their investigation by using cnt blended water diesel emulsion fuel of water by volume in diesel engine and observed substantial improvement in the brake thermal efficiency and drastic reduction of nox and smoke emissions the same team have continued their investigation on incorporating the alumina nanoadditive with the water diesel emulsion fuel and of water by volume and observed considerable improvement in the brake thermal efficiency and reduced harmful pollutants furthermore they found significant reduction in the cylinder peak pressure heat release rate and ignition delay at all loads the same team have utilized alumina nanoadditive and ppm blended with the biodiesel emulsion fuel of water content by volume in single cylinder diesel engine and observed significant improvement in the performance and reduced harmful emissions such as nox and smoke in addition they observed significant increment in the evaporation rate for the nanoparticle blended emulsion fuels than those of neat biodiesel emulsion fuel upon conducting hot plate evaporation study however the effect of alumina nanoadditives with the higher concentration of water biodiesel emulsion fuels is to be investigated on the performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine henceforth the current investigation is focused to provide feasible pathway to incorporate the alumina nanoparticles with the jatropha biodiesel emulsion fuel of water

engine utilized by sadhik and anand as shown in fig and the engine details are shown in table the instrumentation system of the experimental setup consists of an avl di gas analyzer an avl smoke opacity meter and data acquisition system the data acquisition system consists of kistler piezoelectric pressure transducer model a charge amplifier computer printer and crank angle encoder the avl di gas analyzer and avl smoke opacity are positioned in the exhaust manifold to measure the exhaust emissions such as nox co and unburnt hydrocarbons and the smoke opacity calibrated type chrome alumel thermocouple is installed in the immediate exhaust of the diesel engine to measure the exhaust gas temperature the combustion attributes of the diesel engine are obtained by means of the pressure transducer which is flush mounted on the cylinder head and the crank angle encoder is fixed on the output shaft of the engine the piezoelectric pressure transducer is utilized to collect the cylinder pressure data of more than successive cycles using computer software for the determination of the combustion attributes such as heat release rate ignition delay and maximum pressure rise rate the heat

broadly in two steps the surfactant mixture of span sorbitane monooleate and tween polyxyethylene sorbitane monooleate are used as it provided better emulsification results with intermediate hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb in the first step mechanical agitator is utilized to prepare the surfactant mixture by mixing span and tween with by volume the combined hlb values for the surfactants mixture are calculated by hlbab ha wa hb wb wa wb where ha hlb hb hlb wa and wb are the hlb values and weights of the surfactants span and tween the hlb value of ascertained stable

steps with the aid of mechanical agitator and an ultrasonicator model lark sb khz the ultrasonication technique is widely adopted to disperse the nanoparticles in base fluid to facilitate the possible agglomerate particles back to nanometer size in the first step the ultrasonicator is used to disperse the alumina nanoparticles with delimitate mass fraction of ppm in the distilled water by volume for min the photographic and microscopic images of alumina nanoparticles dispersed in the distilled water are shown in fig it is observed that upon adding the alumina nanoparticles to the distilled water there is significant change in color in the second step the surfactant mixture span and tween is prepared in similar fashion as adopted for jbds fuel in the third step the jatropha biodiesel by volume the surfactant mixture span and tween and the distilled water containing alumina nanoparticles are mixed with the aid of mechanical agitator at various test speeds say and rpm for min the prepared nanoparticles biodiesel emulsion fuel jbds a are kept in the graduated glass test tubes and subsequently subjected for the stability characteristic studies the same procedure is carried out for the other mass fractions and ppm to prepare the jbds a and jbds fuels the percentage of separated water layer by volume with respect to the elapsed time is measured for each sample using eq it is observed from fig that the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels produced at test speed of rpm were stable for more than days compared to other test speeds of and rpm moreover it was observed that after ultrasonication the alumina nanoparticles are completely dispersed in the distilled water henceforth this may possibly lead to nanoparticles encased water droplet in the continuous phase of jatropha biodiesel during the emulsification process under these circumstances the nanoparticles encapsulated water droplet in the biodiesel emulsion fuel will not have tendency to undergo wear in the engine fuel system nor in the injection systems the following section illustrates the results obtained from the combustion performance and the emission characteristics of the diesel engine using the tested fuels the variation of cylinder pressure and the heat release rate are plotted against crank angle whereas the ignition delay and maximum pressure rise rate are plotted against the brake mean effective pressure bmep the variation of the brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption and the emission characteristics are plotted against bmep figure illustrates the variation of cylinder pressure and the heat release rate at the full load with respect to crank angle for the tested fuels it is examined from the figure that the magnitude of the peak pressure and heat release rate is high for the jatropha biodiesel emulsion fuel due to the enhancement of premixed combustion and prolonged ignition delay compared to other tested fuels sachuthananthan and jeyachandran also observed the similar trend of enhanced heat release rate for their biodiesel emulsion fuel on the other hand the magnitude of combustion parameters such as heat release rate peak pressure and pressure rise rate refer to fig is reduced for the nanoparticle blended jatropha biodiesel emulsion fuels than biodiesel emulsion fuel this could be due to the presence of potential nanoparticles in the biodiesel emulsion fuel which has lead to early combustion owing to their shortened ignition delay enhanced surface area volume ratio and improved ignition characteristics the cylinder peak pressure for the jbds at the full load observed is bars compared to and bars for jbd jbds a jbds a and jbds a respectively figure depicts the variation of ignition delay with respect to bmep for the tested fuels it is observed that there is problem of prolong ignition delay associated with the biodiesel emulsion fuel due to the enhancement of premixed combustion and significant heat absorption by water vaporization in the fuel jet while in the case of nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels the magnitude of ignition delay is reduced considerably owing to the quick evaporation rate improved ignition properties and enhanced surface area volume ratio characteristics furthermore during the ignition delay period the presence of potential nanoparticles in the fuel air mixture could have improved as result of enhanced surface area volume ratio due to early combustion in addition it is experimentally proved that the rate of evaporation for the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels is quicker than that of biodiesel emulsion fuel and neat biodiesel with the aid of hot plate evaporation setup in general the hot plate evaporation characteristic is adopted to predict the performance of the combustion process of the emulsion fuels the hot plate evaporation characteristic for the tested fuels is carried out from the setup utilized by sadhik and anand as shown in fig the hot plate setup majorly consists of stainless steel plate electrical heater thermocouples and variac the hot plate has mirror finished concave cavity at the top surface to accommodate specified mass of the fuel droplet and was kept directly on top of an electrical heater height of mm is chosen to drop the fuel droplets on the concave cavity by means of glass burette the type thermocouples are installed near the concave cavity to record the temperature of the hot plate and the variac is used to maintain the surface temperature of the hot plate when the electrical heater is switched on the hot plate temperature rises as consequence when the hot plate temperature reaches steady state condition the fuel droplets are made to fall on the concave cavity simultaneously the time duration is noted using digital timer until the fuel droplet disappears on the hot surface series of three trials is performed under identical conditions to check for the repeatability of the results and each recorded time is the average of three values the variations of evaporation rate with respect to hot plate surface temperature for the tested fuels are shown in fig it is noted that the evaporation rate is considerably reduced for the nanoparticle blended emulsion fuels than that of jbds fuel at all hot plate surface temperatures this could be attributed to nanoparticles encased water droplet present in biodiesel emulsion fuel which has enhanced the heat transfer rate during the evaporation in general the addition of nanoparticles to any base fluid such as water enhances the heat transfer rate owing to their high surface area volume ratio and heat conduction properties moreover as the nanoparticles are enveloped in the water droplet the conduction heat transfer is dominant and hence the rate of evaporation rate is accelerated than that of jbds furthermore the critical surface temperatures the temperature corresponding to maximum heat transfer rate e minimum evaporation time for jbds a jbds a jbds a jbds and jbd observed are and respectively and are shown in the figure it is also noted that the critical surface temperature of the jbds a fuel is lower due to the high dosage of alumina nanoparticles which have lead to high heat transfer rate resulting in minimum evaporation time hence this study ensures that the magnitude of the ignition delay could be shortened due to the addition of nanoparticles to the biodiesel emulsion fuel as consequence if the hot plate temperature is further enhanced the fuel droplet lifetime dramatically increases due to the development of insulating vapor layer between the droplet and the hot plate as an effect of the leidenfrost phenomena figure illustrates the variation of brake thermal efficiency for the tested fuels with respect to bmep it is observed that at all loads the brake thermal efficiency of the nanoparticle blended emulsion fuels is high compared to that of jbds and jbd fuels this could be probably due to the combined effect of microexplosion and secondary atomization along with the presence of potential nanoparticles as shown in fig the microexplosion phenomenon in the water biodiesel emulsion fuel is result of the volatility difference between water and biodiesel once the alumina nanoparticles encased water droplet biodiesel emulsion fuel subjected to high pressure and high temperature environment in the engine cylinder the water droplets will absorb the heat quickly due to the low boiling point water as compared to that of biodiesel this effect leads to the explosion of water droplets through the surrounding oil layers called microexplosion subsequently number of secondary fuel droplets of very fine size are produced which in turn evaporates quickly thus the formation of secondary droplets in the combustion chamber enhances the fuel air mixing in the presence of potential nanoparticles furthermore the nanoparticles in general possess enhanced surface area volume ratio and reactive surfaces which leads to higher chemical reactivity to act as catalyst under these circumstances the brake thermal efficiency of nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels is improved owing to the catalytic activity of alumina nanoparticles on the other hand the brake thermal efficiency of jbds fuel is low due to the effect of water addition longer ignition delay and reduced engine temperature the maximum brake thermal efficiency at the full load is for jbds a whereas it is and for jbds a jbds a jbds and jbd respectively the variation of brake specific fuel consumption for the tested fuels with respect to bmep is shown in fig it is observed that the brake specific fuel consumption is improved for the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels compared to that of jbds and jbd this could be due to the existence of alumina nanoparticles in the encapsulated water droplets present in the biodiesel emulsion fuel owing to the enhanced surface area volume ratio and shorten ignition delay characteristics of nanoparticles sufficient fuel could have accrued in the combustion chamber to undergo possible catalytic effect in the unit volume of the fuel during the combustion this effect could have lead to improvement in the specific fuel consumption for the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels compared to that of biodiesel emulsion fuel in the case of jbds fuel the water droplets in the biodiesel oil layer undergo rapid evaporation delaying autoignition due to prolonged ignition delay this leads to excess fuel burning in premixed combustion which results in higher brake specific fuel consumption compared to that of nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels the lower brake specific fuel consumption observed is kg kw for jbds a whereas it is and kg kw for jbds a jbds a jbds and jbd at the full load respectively variation of nitrogen oxide nox the formation of nox emission in diesel engines is due to the high temperature environment and oxygen availability during the combustion it is observed from fig that the magnitude of nox emissions is high for jbd compared to that of other tested fuels owing to their high oxygen content and exorbitant gas temperature in the case of jbds fuel the magnitude of nox emission is drastically reduced than that of the jbd fuel due to the microexplosion and heat sink effects caused by the finely dispersed water droplets present in the emulsion fuel and high latent heat of vaporization kj kg of water on the other hand there is further reduction of nox emissions for the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels compared to that of the jbds fuel due to reduced ignition delay early combustion and ample fuel accumulation in the engine cylinder on the account of the shorten ignition delay effect associated with the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels sufficient fuel could have accumulated in the engine cylinder enhancing better fuel air mixing to cause reduced nox emissions furthermore there is also considerable reduction in the exhaust gas temperature for the biodiesel emulsion fuels compared to that of jbd as an effect of microexplosion as shown in fig owing to this effect the water droplet in the combustion chamber lowers the charge temperature in the engine cylinder inducing reduced exhaust gas temperature compared to that of jbd fuel the magnitude of nox emission observed is ppm for jbds a whereas it is and ppm for jbds a jbds a jbd and jbd at the full load respectively figure illustrates the variation of co and unburnt hc emissions for the tested fuels it is observed from the figure that there is an enhancement in co emissions for the biodiesel emulsion fuel this could be probably due to the adverse effect of water addition which has lead to accumulation of more fuel on the account of prolonged ignition delay on the other hand there is marginal decrement in co emissions for the nanoparticle biodiesel emulsion fuels compared to that of jbds this could be attributed to the enhanced surface area volume ratio and high catalytic activity of alumina nanoparticles present in the biodiesel emulsion fuel which has lead to shortened ignition delay due to this effect there is an enhancement in the fuel air mixing in the combustion chamber leading to complete combustion the variation of unburnt hydrocarbon emissions for the tested fuels is depicted in fig in general the magnitude of unburnt hc emissions for the emulsion fuels is enhanced owing to the higher accumulation of fuel in the premixed combustion phase as result of prolonged ignition delay this effect could have lead to increased unburnt hc emissions for the biodiesel emulsion fuel compared to that of nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels in the case of nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels the magnitude of unburnt hc emissions is reduced due to hydrocarbon oxidation and secondary atomization effects furthermore the degree of fuel air mixing in the presence of nanoparticles could have improved on the account of secondary atomization and improved catalytic effect associated with the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels the magnitude of unburnt hc emission observed is ppm for jbds a whereas it is and ppm for jbds a jbds a jbd and jbd at the full load respectively variation of smoke figure shows the variations of smoke opacity for the tested fuels at the loads it is observed from the figure that there is significant reduction of smoke emissions for the biodiesel emulsion fuels as compared to that of neat biodiesel the reduced smoke emissions for the biodiesel emulsion fuel could be due to the presence of water vapor in the combustion chamber as result of microexplosion effect which have lead to dilution in the concentration of black smoke in addition on the account of the water content in the biodiesel emulsion fuel there could be an appreciable amount of air entrainment in the emulsion spray and enhanced oh hydroxyl radicals during the combustion in the engine cylinder which have collectively lead to substantial reduction of smoke emissions the alumina nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels also shown similar characteristic trend as that of biodiesel emulsion fuel with further reduction of smoke emissions the addition of nanoparticles to the biodiesel emulsion fuel has imparted shorter ignition delay enhanced evaporation and improved ignition characteristics due to the above effects associated with the nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuels an ample fuel could have been induced in the combustion chamber prior to the ignition leading to better combustion air fuel mixing and in turn resulting in reduced smoke emissions furthermore the possible particulates nanoparticles from diesel exhaust can be trapped at the exhaust manifold by employing electrostatic precipitator the magnitude of the smoke opacity at the full load is for jbds a whereas it is and for jbds a jbds a jbds and jbd respectively the following conclusions may be drawn as result of the present investigation the prepared biodiesel emulsion fuels with without alumina nanoparticles were stable for more than five days under idle conditions the addition of potential nanoparticles to the biodiesel emulsion fuels has imparted reduced peak pressure heat release rate and ignition delay compared to that of neat biodiesel emulsion fuel operation the brake thermal efficiency of jbds a fuel is high compared to that of other tested fuels at the rated load the maximum brake thermal efficiency of jbds a fuel is whereas it is for the jbd fuel the nox and smoke emissions are drastically reduced for the biodiesel emulsion fuels compared to that of jatropha biodiesel the magnitude of nox and smoke emission observed is ppm and for jbds a fuel whereas it is ppm and for jbd fuel at the full load respectively as whole the performance and the emission characteristics of the diesel engine are improved due to the incorporation of alumina nanoparticles in the biodiesel emulsion fuels leading to reduced peak pressure and ignition delay  this paper reviews our work on the application of ultrafast pulsed laser micro nanoprocessing for the three dimensional biomimetic modification of materials surfaces it is shown that the artificial surfaces obtained by femtosecond laser processing of si in reactive gas atmosphere exhibit roughness at both micro and nanoscales that mimics the hierarchical morphology of natural surfaces along with the spatial control of the topology defining surface chemistry provides materials exhibiting notable wetting characteristics which are potentially useful for open microfluidic applications depending on the functional coating deposited on the laser patterned structures we can achieve artificial surfaces that are of extremely low surface energy thus water repellent and self cleaned and responsive e showing the ability to change their surface energy in response to different external stimuli such as light electric field and ph moreover the behavior of different kinds of cells cultured on laser engineered substrates of various wettabilities was investigated experiments showed that it is possible to preferentially tune cell adhesion and growth through choosing proper combinations of surface topography and chemistry it is concluded that the laser textured micro nano si surfaces with controllability of roughness ratio and surface chemistry can advantageously serve as novel means to elucidate the cell scaffold interactions for tissue engineering applications nature offers diverse wealth of functional surfaces whose properties are unmatched in today artificial materials there is growing body of information describing natural materials with sophisticated design strategies which lend the organisms and plants superior mechanical self cleaning optical adhesive actuation sensing and responsive capabilities such adaptive and responsive self assembly is provided by means of hierarchical self organization and optimization of the biological material at each level of hierarchy to yield outstanding performance indeed well ordered multiscale structures with dimensions of features ranging from the macro to the nanoscale are extremely common in natural materials learning from nature will give us important inspiration to develop new techniques and methodologies to construct artificial advanced materials this approach of designing novel materials is called biomimetics and involves the transformation of the ideas concepts and underlying principles developed by nature into manmade technology although biomimetics has emerged in the it has been developing rapidly in the past decade due to advancements in nano and biotechnologies currently large area of biomimetic research deals with functional micro and nanostructures for nanoscale devices water repellence self cleaning drag reduction in fluid flow energy conversion and conservation high adhesion aerodynamic lift materials and fibers with high mechanical strength antireflection structural coloration thermal insulation self healing responsiveness and sensory aid mechanisms all these exceptional functionalities are excellently demonstrated by natural systems and are based on variety of ingenious designs of biological surfaces similar to all natural materials biological surfaces exhibit hierarchical morphology at the micro and the nanoscales while the desired functionality is achieved through tailored synergy of surface roughness and chemistry this paper will review our effort on the fabrication and functionalization of biomimetic artificial micro and nanotextured surfaces for novel applications based on ultrafast laser structuring of materials following nature strategy we have developed two step approach in the first step the morphological characteristics were controlled through ultrafast laser micro nanostructuring whereas in the second step the surface chemistry is tuned depending on the desired functionality emphasis will be placed on the methodologies employed appropriate for microfluidics and tissue engineering applications for which there is an increasing demand over the previous years in both cases the significance of dual scale biomimetic morphology will be indicated besides presenting recent advances achieved it will also delineate existing limitations and discuss emerging possibilities and future prospects biomimetic fabrication of hierarchical several different physical and chemical patterning approaches have been employed for structuring surfaces so as to tailor their morphology including photolithography templated electrochemical deposition plasma treatments electron beam lithography and selective growth of carbon nanotubes ultrafast lasers are increasingly proving to be promising tool for three dimensional micro and submicron texturing of materials surfaces one of the most useful properties of ultrafast laser induced modification is the limited size of the affected volume ablation with laser pulses is induced by optical breakdown which generates plasma near the laser focus because the plasma recombines before thermal diffusion shock wave propagation and cavitation set in ablation of the substrate is confined at least initially to small volume although the intensity required to initiate breakdown is fairly high the short duration of the pulse allows the threshold intensity to be achieved with lower intensity the combination of localized excitation and low threshold fluence can greatly reduce the extent of collateral damage to surrounding areas so that the size of the affected material can be microscopic very close to the diffraction limited focusing volume as consequence three dimensional structures constructed using nonlinear absorption laser structuring techniques provide excellent control over micro and submicron scales additional advantages of laser structuring include its very high fabrication rate noncontact interaction applicability to many types of materials such as ceramics metals and polymers and reproducibility it can be used to shape materials both laterally as well as into the depth of the material hence allowing the manufacture of structures with complex geometries including shapes or structures with varying wall shapes and etch depths and various aspect ratios on the same substrate which represents great difficulty for planar clean room techniques furthermore lasers can be easily incorporated to computer assisted fabrication systems for complex and customized matrix structure design and manufacture such systems gave rise to versatile class of structures production techniques which are laser based solid free form sff fabrication techniques the sff is rapid prototyping technique that allows for control over macroscopic properties such as scaffold shape and microscopic internal architecture microstructuring by femtosecond picosecond and nanosecond lasers in specific reactive environments is specifically attractive because it leads to the formation of high aspect ratio microconical structures on solid surfaces their easy maskless fabrication in combination with their improved properties as compared to untreated surfaces constitutes them particularly attractive for wide range of applications including electronic optical and chemical analysis special interest has been shown in the unique optical properties microstructured si exhibits e increased absorptance throughout wide spectral range for possible applications in photodetector and solar cell technology this property is consequence of the highly rough morphology and chemical modification induced by laser irradiation in the presence of the reactive gas owing to this unique optical property microstructured si is often called black si this section deals with the formation of structures on si and metallic surfaces both at the micrometer and the nanometer length scale upon laser irradiation with near infrared femtosecond laser pulses in reactive gas atmosphere the processes by which femtosecond laser pulses interact with silicon differ greatly from those longer pulses the modification of solids with femtosecond pulses is not yet well understood but it is considered that nonthermal ultrafast phase transformations can occur on timescale much faster than thermal processes it will be shown that the interaction of femtosecond laser irradiation with conductive solids leads to the formation of microconical structures on its surface whose characteristics can be controlled by laser parameters emphasis will be given on the advantage of femtosecond laser structuring under reactive gas which leads to controlled dual scale rough surfaces comprising microconical structures decorated with nanometer sized protrusions it is concluded that femtosecond laser irradiation can lead to simultaneous structuring of solid substrates at two length scales through simple one step production process which is highly desirable for applications details on the experimental procedure followed for the femtosecond laser induced surface structuring of si can be found elsewhere briefly single crystal si wafers were subjected to laser irradiation in vacuum chamber evacuated down to residual pressure of mbar constant sf pressure of torr was maintained during the process through precision microvalve system the irradiating laser source was constituted by regenerative amplified ti sapphire nm delivering fs pulses at repetition rate of khz the sample was mounted on high precision y translation stage normal to the incident laser beam mechanical shutter was synchronized to the translation stages exposing any given spot on the si surface to an average of pulses each microstructured surface was fabricated at constant fluence ranging from to cm after laser irradiation the microstructured surfaces were cleaned with ultrasonic baths of trichloroethylene followed by acetone and ethanol followed by hydrofluoric acid hf aqueous treatment in order to remove the oxide grown on the treated surface then each surface was morphologically characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy sem an image processing algorithm was implemented in order to obtain quantitative information concerning the topological characteristics of the formed structures e spikes density profile height and surface area from top side view and cross sectional sem pictures of the structured regions the textured si surfaces realized by employing the same number of laser pulses at different irradiation fluences are presented in fig increasing the incident energy per unit area causes remarkable changes in the structure shape dimension and density at low fluences laser heating induces melting of the surface producing rippled landscape with structures not completely physically separated upon increasing fluence conical morphology is promoted on the surface with spikes becoming more pronounced and spatially separated in the low fluence regime the average interspike spacing base diameter and height increase with laser fluence whereas their density decreases for large fluence values above cm the spikes density reaches plateau while the height stabilizes around besides directly affecting the micrometer scale surface topology increasing fluence is also crucial to induce more pronounced submicrometer decoration on the spikes walls in particular the protrusions with size from tens to few hundreds of nanometers which provide the double length scale pattern on the si surface become more evident as the laser fluence increases fig the micrometer scale features generated by the spikes landscape together with the nanoscale features generated by the surface prongs on the cones result into significant increase of the overall roughness it should be outlined that the reactive gas plays distinct role in the fabrication process since it determines the sharpness of the microstructures obtained furthermore the formation of second length scale roughness on the cones surface becomes more pronounced with increasing ambient gas pressure on the contrary the si structures fabricated in vacuum are blunt and irregular the microstructures obtained in si can be transferred to various types of polymeric and or biopolymeric materials through replication molding techniques figure shows examples of microstructures replicated in photocurable ormocer and biodegradable plga polymer respectively replication e the copying of surface microstructures from master sample mold into formable material may offer an important fabrication technology for certain types of applications this technology features limited processing steps and prompts lower production costs for mass production since many copies can be made from single mold along with the spatial control of the surface topology defining surface chemistry can provide new insights into fundamental aspects of liquid manipulation in microfluidics and cell response the functionalization approach presented in the following is to attach passive and or responsive chemical materials onto the structured surfaces by appropriate immobilization processes that will lead to well defined surface chemistry such coatings can potentially induce large differences in the surface energy while keeping the same morphology furthermore controlled deposition of functional responsive synthetic materials can reversibly switch the surface energy and thus wettability in response to appropriate external stimuli including light electric field ph temperature salt concentration etc the surfaces attained with the capacity to exquisitely control micro nanotopography and chemistry will enable multiparametric assessment of the various tools to tune surface energy with far reaching implications for microfluidics and tissue engineering applications controllable manipulation of liquids has been the subject of considerable amount of scientific research for the development of microfluidic and lab on chip devices in search of ways to efficiently drive drop to specific sites in order to perform discrete functions such as mixing analysis reaction and storage different approaches have been implemented based on the control over interfacial energy and thus wettability indeed employing surface energy gradients to manipulate liquids has been common approach for liquid actuation in microfluidics actuations using maragoni effects electrowetting effects stimuli responsive surface energy changes and those due to wettability gradient created by varying chemical composition have been reported in the past advances in microfluidic systems design can be achieved via adapting the special wettabilities and behaviors of natural materials in future biomimetic microfluidic systems nature teaches us that special wetting characteristics can be achieved through the synergy of micro and nanoroughness and surface chemistry in the past few years there have been remarkable advances in the understanding of wetting properties of rough surfaces this knowledge opened up the possibility of employing roughness gradients as new additional control variable that can be exploited to attain liquid manipulation accordingly there is an increasing research interest to realize open microfluidic systems based on the synergy of roughness and chemistry to manipulate liquids in most cases the role of biomimetic hierarchical roughness is proved to be crucial depending on the desired functionality wide spectrum of hierarchical morphologies has been obtained and combined with various functional chemistries giving rise to the first biomimetic microfluidic devices in this context manufacturing schemes enabling the controlled and reproducible structuring of materials at micro and nanoscales combined with surface functionalization methods are very desirable direct laser micro nanostructuring is mature and versatile technique that presents some key benefits over other more established microfabrication techniques for open microfluidic applications there are several recent reports on the implementation of ultrafast laser direct writing for liquid manipulation via altering surface wettability using direct high intensity femtosecond laser surface structuring guo et al created novel surface pattern that transforms regular si or metallic surfaces to superwicking due to the superwicking effect the structured surface renders liquids to sprint vertically uphill against the gravity over an extended distance furthermore microfluidic open channels with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces have been fabricated using femtosecond laser direct ablation of poly methyl methacrylate pmma at various fluences zhang et al reported special wetting characteristics of si surfaces patterned by femtosecond laser micromachining including high adhesive force and anisotropic wettability finally femtosecond laser modification followed by hf treatment was proved to be powerful method for fabricating microfluidic structures inside photosensitive glass control over the wettability of solids and manufacturing of functional surfaces with special hydrophobic and self cleaning properties has aroused great interest because of its significance for vast range of applications in daily life industry and agriculture manufactured superhydrophobic and water repellent surfaces have been demonstrated for wide range of applications such as self cleaning surfaces biological scaffolds microfluidics lab on chip devices coatings for automotive and aerospace vehicles and textiles mimicking nature has been central strategy in this field since biological species have many extraordinary wetting properties one example is the lotus plant nelumbo nucifera the sacred lotus revered as symbol of purity in several ancient cultures its leaves stay clean even though it grows in muddy lakes and ponds the leaf is so water repellent that droplet touching its surface instantly acquires spherical shape and even slight tilting causes it to roll off the leaf this was coined the lotus effect similar behavior has been observed on other biological surfaces like the wings of cicada orni or rhinotermitidae insects water repellent surface exhibits certain remarkable wetting characteristics originating from very high contact angles cas in excess of and very small values of contact angle hysteresis less than droplets roll down these surfaces at speed faster than that of solid sphere rolling under gravity they can fully bounce after impacting the surface whereas the time of contact of an impacting droplet with the surface is independent of its velocity in order to create the lotus effect it is important to understand how nature generates this property sem images of water repellent biosurfaces have revealed large structural diversity with the common characteristic of roughness over two different length scales in particular the lotus leaf surface is covered with micrometer sized papillae decorated with nanometer branchlike protrusions apart from this unique hierarchical morphology the surface chemistry originates from epidermal cells of waxy hydrophobic crystals the roughness of the hydrophobic papillae reduces the contact area between the surface and liquid drop with droplets residing only on the tips of the epicuticular wax crystals on the top of papillose epidermal cells water repellency stems from the synergy of dual length scale roughness and hydrophobic surface chemistry thus researchers are seeking simple micro and nanomanufacturing methods that enable the reproducible construction of double length scale topologies in sec ii we have presented methodology to prepare artificial surfaces that possess hierarchical micro and nanostructures they are prepared with simple one step production process using ultrafast femtosecond laser irradiation of silicon surface under reactive gas atmosphere the height of the microscale conical features along with the number of nanoscale protrusions decorating the cones increases with laser fluence resulting in significant increase of the overall roughness accordingly in the high fluence regime the nanometer scale roughness becomes increasingly enhanced further reduction of the surface free energy and thus increase in hydrophobicity is achieved by coating the dual rough patterned surfaces by organosilane monolayers dimethyldichlorosilane dmdcs is chosen among other hydrophobic silanes due to its lower tendency to polymerize on si surfaces and its excellent stability allowing it to maintain its hydrophobic properties for long time and wide temperature range the ca measured on the dmdcs coated flat si was close to that reported for total monolayer coverage spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on the flat region of the samples show that the average thickness of the silane coating is about nm in agreement with other studies on similar coatings atomic force microscopy images of silane coated regions on the flat part of si show relatively homogeneous deposition of molecules over the entire area the rms roughness is nm indicating dense void free coverage figure shows the snapshots of water droplet lying on dmdcs terminated flat and microstructured si surfaces as function of laser fluence the corresponding evolution of the cas and sliding angles measured on the laser structured surfaces are shown in fig water droplets leave the structured area at tilt angles lower than for samples treated at fluences higher than cm interestingly these high fluence samples exhibit the most pronounced second length scale surface roughness samples in the midfluence range cm do not meet both criteria for superhydrophobicity they exhibit high sliding angles although they show similar contact angle to their high fluence counterparts at fluences lower than cm water drops remain pinned on these surfaces at the highest sliding angles utilized evidently contact angle hysteresis is very important parameter when droplet motion on surface is considered motion initiation at very low inclination angles on the high fluence superhydrophobic surfaces is translated into small gravitational force required to initiate motion in other words the friction between the droplet and the structured surface is accordingly low low frictional motion is key feature behind the unique lotus self cleaning property and it is therefore desirable in any corresponding application as it provides for efficient motion of water droplets even when long travel distances are necessary the artificial surfaces prepared at high fluences can quantitatively mimic both the structure and the water repellent characteristics of the natural lotus leaf images of water droplet lying on the artificial surface are shown in fig which can be directly compared to those of droplet lying on the surface of lotus leaf shown in fig the static ca of water on the artificial surface is measured as with contact angle hysteresis of whereas those on the lotus leaf as and respectively figure shows the sem images of the surface of the lotus leaf which comprises randomly distributed almost hemispherically topped papillae with sizes of mm height to basal radius aspect ratio of decorated with branch like protrusions with size of about nm fig these observations are in agreement with earlier reports figure shows the sem micrographs of the most water repellent artificial surface which exhibits the highest contact angle and the lowest hysteresis among the different surfaces obtained by varying the irradiation parameters its morphology looks very similar to that of the lotus leaf fig consisting of microscale conical features decorated with nanoscale protrusions the protrusions in this case have conical or pyramidal asperities with average size of and aspect ratio of nanostructures of sizes up to few hundred nanometers are clearly seen on the slopes of the protrusions fig thus the femtosecond laser irradiation under reactive sf atmosphere was indeed able to produce surface that mimics the structural features of the lotus leaves as well as their water ca properties additional quantitative information on the water repellence properties of surface can be determined through studying the dynamic behavior of water droplet impinging on it the upper part of fig presents selected sequence of snapshots of water drop impacting on the laser structured silanized surface in comparison to lotus leaf surface the minima and maxima of the drop trajectory are shown here as function of time the drop shape changes significantly during impact insets as its kinetic energy transforms into stored energy despite the strong deformation of the liquid both surfaces are so water repellent that the drop bounces back numerous times on the contrary no rebound is observed when the drop impacts on the flat unstructured region of silanized silicon surface the elasticity of the collisions observed on both the artificial laser structured surface and that of the natural lotus leaf is remarkable indicating high degree of repellency direct measure of this elasticity is the restitution coefficient defined as the ratio of the center of mass velocity just after impact to that just before impact this coefficient was deduced from the respective heights the droplet reaches after impact and is shown in fig as function of the impact velocity the highest elasticity is observed at intermediate velocities where the restitution coefficient is found to exceed denoting that of the drop initial kinetic energy is restored upon impact its value matches that of the lotus leaf and to our knowledge is among the highest ever reported in summary we have shown that femtosecond laser structuring under reactive gas atmosphere can produce surface that mimics both qualitatively and quantitatively the structural features of the lotus leaves as well as their water repellence performance to our knowledge this is the first time such direct comparison of performance is made and it clearly demonstrates the possibility of designing highly efficient biomimetic water repellent surfaces this opens up the possibility for fabrication of water repellent surfaces in other types of materials such as metals polymers as well as optically transparent materials thus creating opportunities for various exciting applications these include self cleaning water resistant surfaces low frictional underwater and anti ice coatings as well as controlled deposition and guiding of water droplets and biofluids in biomicrofluidics stimuli responsive smart the understanding and fabrication of functional and responsive surfaces with wetting properties that can be controllably altered on demand has attracted the interest of the scientific community due to their wide variety of potential applications including micro nanofluidics lab on chip devices controllable drug delivery enzyme immobilization bioseparation cell sheet engineering sensor development energy and green engineering antifouling and self cleaning surfaces these surfaces are able to reversibly switch their hydrophobicity hydrophilicity in response to external stimuli such as temperature ph photon energy electric or magnetic fields humidity and electrochemical and chemical treatments moreover such response significantly modifies the selective adhesion and tack of these surfaces functionalization of an artificially roughened surface with responsive coating is expected to enhance the switching effect and result in surface that can potentially switch between hydrophobicity or superhydrophobicity and hydrophilicity or superhydrophilicity in response to appropriate external stimuli the possibility of multiresponsive surfaces has been explored as well in the following we will present our methodology for creating responsive surfaces via proper functionalization of femtosecond laser micro nanopatterned si substrates depending on the functional coating deposited onto those surfaces different functionalities are attained including photo electro and ph responsiveness in all cases we show that the principal effect of hierarchical roughness is to cause an amplification of the response to the external stimulus photoswitchable the wetting properties of metal oxides mainly of zno and tio have been widely studied since their wettability can be reversibly switched between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity by alternation of ultraviolet uv irradiation and dark storage so far most previous works have been focused mainly on zno nanorods nanowires and nanobelts however it remains big challenge to develop simple and reliable synthetic methods for zno hierarchical architectures with controlled morphology which are important to amplify the photoswitching effect and to explore in detail the effect of roughness on photoresponse we have developed two step approach in order to achieve zno surface exhibiting roughness at two length scales microscale roughness in the shape of spikes is achieved on si wafer by structuring with femtosecond laser pulses nanoscale roughness is subsequently obtained by coating the laser structured surface with zno nanograins grown by pulsed laser deposition pld consequently an enhancement of the nanoscale roughness is realized and the final zno surface comprises hierarchical micro and nanostructures figure shows the sem pictures of the initial microstructured silicon surfaces as well as those acquired after the deposition of the nanograined zno film we have prepared three types of surfaces namely sample the si microstructure prepared at cm sample the si microstructure prepared at cm and zno nanostructured thin film as clearly seen significant enhancement of the nanoscale roughness is attained the micrometer scale spikes have been decorated by nanosized zno protrusions resulting in hierarchically rough surface the nanoscale features are more pronounced in sample than in sample the corresponding contact angles were measured to be for sample and for sample the stoichiometry of the zno protrusions was confirmed by energy dispersive ray spectroscopy edx measurements performed on different positions on the structured surfaces the elemental analysis performed by edx of the spectrum was found to be similar to that obtained in the flat part of the sample outside the spikes area figure depicts the contact angle evolution with uv illumination time for the different zno structures employed the uv source used was krf excimer laser nm with an intensity of mw cm at the position of the samples both structured samples exhibit significant photoinduced transition to superhydrophilicity reaching nearly zero contact angle in short time more importantly the contact angle reduction rate being measure of the efficiency of the light induced process is higher than that observed in other zno structures on the contrary the nanostructured zno thin film shows weak response to uv irradiation as the wetting angle change in this case is much smaller for the same irradiation time it should be emphasized that the aforementioned wettability changes are reversible since both dark storage and thermal heating reconvert the superhydrophilic surfaces to their original states after the uv irradiation the samples were placed in the dark the hydrophobicity for samples and was restored within whereas the flat sample requires day storage in order to return to its initial wetting state alternatively thermal heating at for can return all surfaces to their original hydrophobic state speeding up the reversibility process all samples were subjected to numerous switching cycles fig without observing any deterioration of either the irradiation efficiency or the reversibility behavior in conclusion the above methodology can be employed to control the structural and morphological properties of zno structures resulting in reversible efficient wettability changes such capability may be useful for self cleaning coatings and microfluidic applications as well as for studying the photoswitchable wettability of surfaces and its relation to micro and nanostructures electroswitchable liquid actuation and manipulation using electrowetting on dielectric ewod is becoming promising tool toward the realization of modern microfluidic devices indeed ewod has been used to demonstrate variety of microfluidic operations such as droplet actuation dispensing mixing and splitting apart from lab on chip devices applications related to adjustable lenses display technology fiber optics and microelectromechanical systems have been demonstrated typically an electrowettable surface consists of conductive lower layer with dielectric layer sandwiched between the lower electrode and an upper hydrophobic material which lowers the surface energy and confers larger initial hydrophobicity fig a slightly conductive droplet creates capacitance defined by the contact area of the droplet and the substrate when voltage is applied between the conductor and the insulator an electric charge is created and this alters the surface free energy balance the additional energy per unit area due to the capacitance is given by v where for simple planar surface the capacitance per unit area is r d where is the dielectric constant of the layer is its thickness and is the dielectric constant of air it is found that on flat surface the equilibrium ca for given voltage v is given by the expressioncos v cos r d lv cos esl lv otherwise known as the lippmann young equation here lv is the liquid air interfacial tension esl is the electric field induced surface tension and is the ca prior to application of the electric field the prediction of this equation is that voltage will cause the ca of droplet to decrease so that reduction in hydrophobicity occurs although this effect is seen in practice there is problem of ca saturation after threshold voltage the phenomenon is also reversible although partial reversibility is often observed there are many factors which affect the performance of an electrowettable surface such as the surface tension of the materials in order to reduce voltage requirements which is desirable for microfluidic chip technology the basic strategy is to use thinner dielectric film with higher dielectric constant and dielectric strength however it is understood that more important limiting factor is the small range of the actuated cas before the electric charge saturation in the dielectric occurs this range depends on the surface wetting angle at zero voltage and the higher this value the greater the attainable ca variation therefore it would be highly advantageous to fabricate electrowettable superhydrophobic surfaces up to now there are few reports in the literature demonstrating ewod on superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces the main difficulty is caused by the high degree of roughness exhibited by superhydrophobic surfaces which leads to substantial spatial separation between the liquid and the underlying electrode strongly impeding the electrowetting effect among them only one has demonstrated reversibility this is attributed to the fact that when the drop wedged in the structures it does not go up leading to an irreversible ewod effect it is thus evident that achieving reversible electrowetting on superhydrophobic surfaces is not only technical challenge but real asset for potential applications in the following we will present reversible ewod of liquid droplets on dual rough superhydrophobic black silicon si surfaces produced by ultrafast pulsed laser micro nanostructuring following irradiations the laser patterned surfaces were covered with thin layer of thermally grown in ambient conditions silicon oxide this would serve as the dielectric layer for the ewod experiments the thickness of this layer was determined by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry performed on the flat part of the oxidized si wafer outside the irradiated area for the planar device it was measured to be nm whereas for the black si device it was nm however the oxidized surface became superhydrophilic and as result water droplet wets completely the patterned area to perform ewod experiments and achieve superhydrophobicity the oxidized surfaces were coated with dmdcs silane monolayers figure shows the final ewod device the same surface treatment was used for flat si samples that were not microstructured during the ewod experiments the apparent ca of glycerol droplet on modified flat and structured si surfaces was measured as function of the applied voltage details of the experimental process can be found elsewhere the detailed evolution of the cas for flat si and superhydrophobic black si sample prepared at high fluence of cm as function of the bias voltage is plotted in fig for the flat surface the ca decreases as the bias voltage increases until it saturates when the ca change becomes the change before saturation is reversible and the ca returns back to its initial value after reducing the applied bias on the contrary partial reversibility was recorded in the case of the black si sample this is presented in fig showing that the behavior is partly reversible as the ca returns close but not exactly at the initial value after lowering the applied bias to reversibility is preserved upon several repetition cycles provided that the applied voltage falls within and the dashed line in fig represents fits to the data according to the behavior predicted by the lippmann young equation eq for the fit we have used in eq the measured oxide thickness the silicon oxide dielectric constant ref and lv mn and the young ca the fit indicates that the experimentally observed behavior is in good agreement with the one predicted by eq until ca saturation occurs on the contrary this is not true for the corresponding ca dependencies measured on the structured sample suggesting that proper modification of eq is required in order to account for the effect of superhydrophobicity on the ewod behavior in superhydrophobic surface the liquid does not completely impale the roughened solid as result air pockets are trapped inside the features underneath the liquid which sits above composite surface made of solid and air this is the so called cassie baxter state where the apparent contact angle cb is an average between the value on air that is and on the flat solid that is and is given bycos cb cos where defines the fraction of the projected solid surface that is wet by the liquid in this case eq is modified to be cos cos cb o rd lvv it is important to note that eq is otherwise identical to eq but the young angle has been replaced by the initial ca of the hydrophobic surface and there is the fractional area in the voltage term since the ewod effect is much weaker on highly hydrophobic surfaces than on normal ones the solid line in fig is fit to the experimental data according to the behavior predicted by the modified lippmann young equation with cb and when the applied field exceeds critical value the apparent contact angle tends to saturate ca saturation is not uncommon in ewod systems however its origin is still undetermined figure shows the recorded leakage current through the superhydrophobic ewod device as function of the applied voltage large jump in the leakage current was observed at about the same voltage where the onset of saturation takes place much higher applied voltage causes dramatic increase of the current which is also indirectly detected by the bubbles rising inside the liquid drop indicating hydrolysis our results are consistent with dielectric breakdown behavior regarding reversibility silicon oxide breakdown is local effect appearing as small spots of the order of nm on the dielectric surface and it is found to be reversible as long as the leakage current is kept low when excessive current is passed g due to high applied voltage breakdown propagates and thermal damage is caused in summary the ewod properties of dual rough si surfaces with different micro and nanomorphological characteristics were investigated and compared to planar si ones the results reveal two potential advantages of using dual rough black si instead of planar si in ewod applications on one hand the roughened surface provides extension of the available ewod voltages that can be applied before breakdown occurs on the other hand the changes in the ca before the systems reach saturation are higher in conclusion our ewod system exhibits remarkable ca reversibility in air environment and may constitute dual rough black si an important material in integrated microfluidic systems ph responsive great number of responsive materials and material surfaces are based on macromolecules often coined with names such as stimuli responsive smart intelligent or environment sensitive polymers this is due to the fact that synthetic polymers offer wealth of opportunities to design sophisticated materials by variation of the length chemical composition architecture and topology of the chains smart polymers can reversibly alter their physicochemical properties even upon slight changes in the conditions of the surrounding environment they respond by modifying the conformation and or location of backbone side chains segments pendant as well as end groups which gives rise to cooperative phase transitions occurring at the micro and macroscale prominent example of smart macromolecules involves the so called ph responsive polymers in which protonation deprotonation events occurring due to ph variations around their effective pk values alter the degree of ionization of the monomer repeat units weak acid or weak base behavior thus modifying the polymer solvent interactions leading to changes of the polymer chain conformations and to the formation of smart polymer nanostructures controlled reorganization of interfacial layers based on environment sensitive polymers has been widely utilized for the design and fabrication of smart responsive material surfaces polymer brushes created by end grafting stimuli sensitive polymers onto surfaces with hierarchical micro nanoroughness have been frequently utilized for the development of such smart surfaces that can respond to changes in ph temperature and solvent quality we have developed polymer functionalized ph responsive surfaces that exhibit hierarchical micro and nanostructured roughness which can reversibly switch between superhydrophilicity at low ph and superhydrophobicity and water repellency at high ph to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such surface is realized to date polymers that become superhydrophobic at low ph and anionic and superhydrophilic at high ph have been reported however that imposes certain limitations for many applications g the anionic polymer surfaces cannot interact with dna enzymes and polyanionic drugs by attractive electrostatic interactions in this respect surfaces functionalized with ph responsive polymers which become cationic and superhydrophilic are especially desirable the responsive surfaces were prepared by grafting from poly diisopropylamino ethyl methacrylate pdpaema brushes onto dual length scale roughened silicon substrates using surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization pdpaema homopolymer is ph responsive weak polybase which undergoes reversible protonation deprotonation process upon changing the solution ph and thus can interact with anionic substances at low ph when it becomes cationic the switching behavior of the surface is driven by the combined effects of the polymer chemical response and the dual scale roughness of the surface which remains unaffected by the polymerization process images of water droplet lying on the pdpaema functionalized artificial surface are shown in fig following successive immersions in solutions at ph and ph the complete wetting superhydrophilicity following the immersion at ph and the superhydrophobic behavior ca following the immersion at ph are due to the reversible protonation deprotonation of dpaema the pk of pdpaema is figure also shows the respective behavior for dual scale roughened surface functionalized with poly diethylamino ethyl methacrylate pdeaema brush the pk of pdeaema is the responsive behavior is evident in this case as well however the behavior after immersion at ph is far from superhydrophobic with the ca reaching only it is noted that the water ca on pdpaema brush on flat si surface is whereas that on pdeaema brush on flat si surface is both in the deprotonated state therefore it is the combined effect of the dual scale roughness and the sufficient hydrophobicity of the material that is necessary in order for surface to become superhydrophobic the incorporation of only two extra methyl groups per monomer unit fig can lead to hydrophobic enough material the average cas of water drops residing on the pdpaema functionalized artificially structured surface are shown in fig following successive immersions at ph and ph it is evident that the responsiveness of the functionalized hierarchically structured surface holds for at least ten cycles with very stable values of the cas of both the superhydrophobic and the superhydrophilic states thus it is proven that the polymer brush synthesized onto the dually roughened surface is resilient to ph variations which is especially important since the brush is immersed in basic and strongly acidic solutions the pdpaema brush synthesized onto flat si surface is responsive as well fig with ca value variations however that is only within the inset of fig presents the selected snapshots of free falling water droplet radius of mm impinging on the pdpaema functionalized artificial surface following its immersion to ph solution the drop impacts the surface with velocity that corresponds to dimensionless weber number of we the surface is so water repellent that the drop bounces back numerous times and selected maxima of its trajectory are shown as function of time the drop finally comes to rest on the surface after ms the restitution coefficient coefficient is deduced from the recorded video images and is shown in fig as function of the impact velocity in comparison with that of the natural lotus leaf the similarity of the restitution coefficient as well as the threshold velocity value necessary to avoid sticking of the drops between the functionalized artificial and the lotus leaf surface is evident in summary ph responsive surfaces were developed which can reversibly switch between superhydrophilic at low ph and superhydrophobic and water repellent at high ph the surfaces were developed by grafting from ph sensitive polymer brush onto controlled hierarchically micro and nanostructured substrates which mimic the hierarchical morphology of natural water repellent surfaces the responsive behavior is due to the combined effect of the hierarchical micro and nanoroughness and the hydrophobicity of the functionalizing polymer brush we demonstrate that the water repellent state of such surfaces requires appropriate hydrophobicity of the functionalizing polymer whereas for the first time we characterize the contact angle hysteresis along with the static contact angle data for the responsive surfaces in their superhydrophobic state biological cell adhesion the in vitro or in vivo synthesis of tissue an organ or part of them has involved unique collaboration between biologists engineer chemists and physicists as consequence an expanded database of knowledge has been arisen over the past decade this literature attempts to apprehend the principles of cell biology to find the relationships between material properties and bioadhesive outcomes and finally to apply this growing database in creating biomaterials that mimic the natural extracellular environment it has been established that cell cell interaction and cell substratum adhesion play crucial role not only in physiological biological processes such as differentiation morphogenesis tissue regeneration wound healing and so forth but they can be involved in biological problems such as carcinogenesis thrombogenesis and abnormal embryogenesis in this respect comprehensive study and understanding of mechanisms involved in cell material interaction is considerably necessary for the creation of cell biomaterial unit suitable for tissue engineering application variety of cell adhesion mechanisms is responsible for assembling cells together and along with their connections to the internal cytoskeleton determines the overall architecture of the tissue by the other side material properties such as surface chemistry energy and morphology are recognized as key factors in controlling cell assembly into features consequently the ability to tailor the surface morphology and chemistry could be beneficial for the use of such structures as model surfaces for the systematic exploration of the role of micro nanomorphology and or surface energy on cell adhesion and growth it is also desirable for the scaffold to enable facile methods of modification to incorporate integral sensors for monitoring purposes and bioactive moieties for influencing cell behavior in this respect the implementation of laser engineered hierarchically structured si surfaces for the development of tissue scaffolds is investigated it is demonstrated that it is possible to preferentially tune cell adhesion and growth by choosing the proper combinations of topography and chemistry of biomimetic micro nanostructures in sec ii it is presented that our direct writing laser technique enables simultaneous structuring at both the micro and the nanolength scales variation of laser fluence caused remarkable changes in the morphological features of the spikes such as height microscale roughness sharpness porosity and nanoscale roughness fig consequently the etched substrates produced should allow more free spaces perpendicular to the culture plane and should also provide physical cues to facilitate cell adhesion and spreading it has also been shown that the laser texturing of si allows the controlled modification of the wetting properties of the surface through systematic and reproducible variation of the surface roughness fig therefore ultrafast laser etched surfaces with the capacity to exquisitely control the size of pores the micro nanotopography and the surface wettability represent promising culture scaffold that might enable multiparametric assessment of the various factors that affect cell behavior with far reaching implications for tissue engineering three series of si substrates were examined type corresponds to the as prepared patterned si surfaces comprising four samples with gradient roughness ratios denoted as a type corresponds to the same substrates coated with hydrophilic thermally grown oxide layer b type corresponds to the same substrates coated by hydrophobic silane layer types and samples had shown the same qualitative results and will be considered as equivalent cases thereafter in all series the corresponding flat surfaces were tested as control samples the principal properties of the above substrate types are summarized in table cell adhesion experiments were performed using the fibroblast nih cell line in order to investigate whether these surfaces were able to modulate cellular responses sem and fluorescence microscopy images fig show that the number of attached cells per unit area decreased as the roughness ratio and ca increased denoting that cell attachment was favored on more hydrophilic surfaces besides fibroblasts si microstructured substrates have been utilized to enable primary neurons to grow in without using synthetic extracellular matrix ecm coatings or chemotropic factors neurons depend on surface support more than other cells but readily adhere to surfaces coated with ecm proteins moreover brain development and neuronal network formation depend on an intricate blueprint of axon guidance dendritic arborisation and synapse formation cues the challenge to comprehend the multitude of cues neurons receive process and direct in vivo and to simulate cultures in vitro has been addressed however the results are limited the importance of three dimensional neuronal cultures can be realized if one thinks that the dimensionality of the network has strong impact on its connectivity and therefore plays an important role for its possible behavior in our studies primary neuronal cells were cultured on laser patterned si substrates in the absence of chemotropic factors or synthetic ecm details of the substrate preparation and culture process can be found elsewhere similar to fibroblasts neuron cell attachment was favored on more hydrophilic surfaces microstructured roughness in the form of spikes promoted the adhesion of single or clusters of neurons to the substrate fig in contrast only few cells survived on flat si substrate used as control that verified the role of roughness in the absence of synthetic ecm the cells developed into dynamic cellular aggregate with long neurites sprouting over the spikes surface fig the integrity and uniform sprouting observed suggest the biocompatibility of the neuronal population with the surface the protrusions of the neurolemma grew over the spikes engulfed their top and incorporated them to form web fig moreover network of nanoscale thin neuritic extensions was formed along the third dimension axis utilizing the space toward the base of the spikes fig as it has been already mentioned the correlation between the substrate characteristics and cell adhesion highly depends on the level of surface free energy originally baier suggested that the amount of bioadhesion does not correlate well with the surface energy of the substrate he reported the existence of surface energy window with minimal adhesion while substrates exhibiting surface energies outside the defined range could absorb considerable amounts of biomass in contrast schakenraad et al found sigmoidal dependence of cell spreading on surface energy indicating sharp transition at low surface energies between poor and good adherence however for the measurement of adhesion in the mentioned reports it was not used one particular type of substratum modified to display different cas but large number of different polymers and glasses thus the effects of surface chemistry and wettability on cell adhesion cannot be separated the physical behavior of hydrolyzed living cells may be regarded as drop of liquid the adhesion of this cell liquid can be affected by the surface wettability due to the increased or decreased contact area which is proportional to the solid liquid interfacial adhesive force alternatively living cell can be described by tensegrity models which consider that cellular shape and adhesion are largely influenced by the cytoskeleton the cell tends to form focal adhesions in locations that balance cytoskeletal forces in this respect surface wettability is crucial as it describes to what extent the surface is exposed to culture medium and subsequent protein adsorption reduction in adhesive protein adsorption due to decreased liquid surface interfacial area may detrimentally affect the ability of cells to form adhesions in any case the surface energy influences the contact area of the cell membrane with the substrate while the profile of the membrane could change depending on the wettability of the adjacent solid in order to understand the cell response on substrates with different roughness one has to consider the effect of the macroscopic roughness on wettability which has been theoretically approached by two different models in the wenzel model the liquid is assumed to wet the entire rough surface without leaving any air pockets underneath it the apparent ca is given by the following equation cos rw cos where rw is the ratio of the unfolded surface to the apparent area of contact under the droplet and is the contact angle on flat surface of the same nature as the rough since rw is always greater than unity this model predicts that the contact angle will decrease increase with surface roughness for an initially hydrophilic hydrophobic surface in contrast cassie and baxter cb assumed that the liquid does not completely permeate the rough surface because air pockets get trapped underneath it the liquid is thus said to be in fakir or the cassie baxter state and the apparent ca cb is an average of the flat surface and the value for full hover over the flat surface that is and is given by eq as is always lower than unity this model always predicts enhancement of hydrophobicity independent of the value of the initial contact angle the lower the value of the smaller the solid liquid contact area and the higher the increase in the measured contact angle following the results presented in fig it is obvious that the ca values measured for the structured substrates are consistent with the cb model because in contrast to the wenzel model it predicts rise in the ca upon enhancement of the roughness of an initially hydrophilic surface hence for the superhydrophobic substrates where the solid liquid contact area is minimal water cannot penetrate the roughness elements and therefore an intervening air layer persists this resembles the case of many aquatic and semiaquatic arthropods insects and spiders which are rendered water repellent due to rough waxy exterior festooned with hairs owing this superhydrophobic integument the respiratory demands of these species are facilitated by thin intervening layer of trapped air which is called plastron and maintained along their body surface this air layer is visible at nonzero reflection angles and is responsible for the silvery underwater reflections from aquatic species indeed as shown in fig when water repellent spike substrate is immersed in water or cell culture liquid it glistens with silvery sheen indicating that sheathing film of air remains on the submerged surface conversely for more hydrophilic substrates the fraction of the wetted area increases and the surface glistening disappears as result of increasing liquid penetration finally for superhydrophilic substrates the contact area is maximized and water completely penetrates the roughness elements therefore taking into account that cell culture medium is aqueous the interaction of cell membrane with the underlying substrate may be governed by the degree of surface wettability and thus surface energy fibroblast and neuron spreading is promoted on hydrophilic or high surface energy rough substrates due to the permeation of the culture liquid in the structures allowing cells to take advantage of the high surface area to volume ratio offered by the structured substrates on the contrary adhesion is almost impossible on ultrahydrophobic or low surface energy rough substrates as the penetration of the culture liquid on the structures is inhibited the results presented in fig for fibroblasts suggest the existence of switching function for the structured si surface characteristics from fibroblast adhesive to fibroblast repulsive when critical combination of roughness and wettability and thus surface energy is attained this switching effect agrees with the sigmoidal dependence suggested by baier and may be attributed to the critical transition from the wenzel to cassie baxter states further support to this statement is coming form the results obtained after substrate oxidation where the highly rough substrate is converted from ultrahydrophobic to ultrahydrophilic and accordingly the wettability switches from cassie baxter to wenzel states as shown in fig in this case remarkable change in cell behavior was observed since fibroblasts spreading and viability seems to be comparable between highly rough oxidized surfaces b and small rough oxidized or nonoxidized surfaces or respectively the importance of surface chemistry was tested also on neuronal survival with the same manner utilizing geometrically identical si substrate following thermal oxidation neurons sensed the vertical microstructured roughness and adhered however prominent feature on oxidized hydrophilic area was the extended cellular death although the oxidized si spikes maintained the same geometrical microenvironment as the bare si spikes they did not allow long term neuronal survival indicating that neuron cells unlike fibroblasts preferentially adhered and have grown on more hydrophobic although not superhydrophobic as well surfaces consequently biomaterial roughness is not stand alone prerequisite for cell survival and growth but it rather requires the synergistic effect of surface chemistry it should be noted that the primary neuronal culture conditions used favored the sole growth of primary neurons and confocal microscopy was employed to confirm the immunofluorescence of tubulin beta iii which is specific for mature neurons that there was no glial feeder layer on the substrates under study fig hence the immunostaining enabled us to confirm the neuronal specificity of our cultures to verify the shape of adhesion on the substrates and to measure significant increase in length for some of the neurons fig it is worth emphasizing that neuronal adhesion was not superficial this was established by the attachment growth and elongation of neurites on the substrates in all three dimensions the undeniable proof of outstanding adhesion properties was derived from the electron micrographs demonstrating how the neuronal membranes incorporated the tips of the spikes as their own besides promoting neuronal adhesion the microscale roughness in synergy with the surface chemistry allowed the formation of an exquisitely organized neuritic network the use of hydrophobic si microstructures enabled the autografting of these structures by the neurons the ability of the neurons to liquefy and adjust their cytoskeletal dynamics is intrinsic nevertheless these intracellular processes that drive membrane extensions as migration or filopodial lengthening still work against the membrane mechanical properties in this study we demonstrated that inherent neuronal guidance cues were sufficient to win over steady state membrane mechanics the outcome was to allow the filopodia of growth cones to explore this permissive microenvironment and in the absence of multidirectional cues to decide depending on the shortest distance thus we can conclude that the sharp transition from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity is accompanied by transition in cell adherence depending on cell type this sharp transition between the two extreme wetting states may be potentially useful tool toward controlling cell behavior on culture substrates furthermore nonmonotonic dependence of fibroblast adhesion on wettability could be detected fig which is qualitatively in accordance with the baier model optimum cell adhesion was obtained for small roughness ratios independent of the ca values and surface chemistry fig this observation was also supported by the sem images of fig where the total number of filopodial processes was much higher in surfaces with low roughness the proliferation and immigration of adhesion depended cells was realized though exertion of contact strain the filopodia of growth cones play an important role in feeling the environment on surface exhibiting suitable roughness the cell soma and the processes would adopt shape complementary to the surface profile achieving maximum contact area and therefore interfacial force this force will benefit cell adhesion and spreading on the substrate surface so that cells recognize and migrate to areas of optimum roughness there have been lot of reports on studying the effect of roughness and surface energy on cellular responses both discrete specimens and surface energy gradients were used in these studies and many different outcomes have been observed in some studies cell functions are enhanced on hydrophilic surfaces whereas in others cell functions are enhanced on hydrophobic surfaces while in other cases surface energy has no effect on cell functions or cell functions have maximum at an intermediate surface energy this broad range of outcomes is possibly result of the wide variability in experimental conditions such as cell types incubation times culture conditions surface chemistries and topographies most studies investigate the separate effect of nano or microroughness respectively on the contrary due to demanding design requirements the synergistic effect of roughness at micro and nanoscales on cell response has been limitlessly studied the present study focuses on cell response on surfaces possessing micro nanotopography e microstructures decorated by secondary nanofeatures thus investigating the synergistic effect of micro and nanoscale roughness on cell adhesion and viability it was also shown that dual rough surface amplifies hydrophilicity toward superhydrophilicity or hydrophobicity toward water repellency and accordingly enhances cell phobicity or cell philicity for the culture substrate the cell spreading dependence on surface energy has an important heuristic impact in the area of biomaterials research and it is crucial to understand this dependence on molecular basis mechanistically one has to go back to the first reaction between biomaterial and the organism which is protein adsorption at high cas e in the hydrophobic range different proteins are adsorbed compared to the hydrophilic range the adsorbed protein layers comprising different proteins on the surface could therefore result in differential tissue reactions which would lead to specific bioadhesion the investigation of protein adsorption to these artificial surfaces needs further exploration in summary it is shown that laser structured si micro and nanorough spike scaffolds with controllability of roughness ratio and surface chemistry can serve as novel means to elucidate the cell biomaterial interactions in vivo the dependency of cell response of different cell types on the artificial structures was investigated and clarified that fundamental parameter that determines cell adhesion on substrates is not solely the degree of roughness or surface chemistry but the synergy of both which determines the wettability or surface energy of the culture substrate indeed proper change in the surface energy for the same degree of roughness can switch the behavior from cell phobic to cell philic and vice versa and this transition is always accompanied by similar sharp transition in surface wettability however and in accordance with previous theoretical models describing cell response nonmonotonic dependence of fibroblast adhesion on wettability is found although it appears to be general tendency that adhesion is favored on hydrophilic substrates it is observed that cells spreading becomes optimum on low rough substrates independent of their wettability this indicates that cell attachment is further enhanced and facilitated by proper form and size of surface topography as pointed out in sec ii the different structures obtained via our laser structuring technique can be transferred to various types of soft materials including biopolymers through replication molding techniques the simplicity of the structuring process and the flexibility of fast patterning by laser beam scanning together with its potential to tailor the surface energy of different classes of materials are certainly useful for creating patterned interfaces on biomaterials devices and tissue engineering the present article is focused on surface micro nanostructuring of materials using femtosecond duration laser pulses as well as the functionalization methodologies used for controlling materials properties direct irradiation of materials by ultrafast laser pulses often induces modifications leading to complex micro and nanoscale surface structures which mimic the morphology of surfaces found in nature we demonstrate that ultrafast laser micro nanostructured materials can be exploited for diverse emerging applications including biomimetic and responsive alteration of static and dynamic wetting response in microfluidics and applications related to scaffold biocompatibility and tissue engineering however the wealth of arising possibilities in laser based micro and nanofabrication and the number of new approaches to nanoscale fabrication prescribe future where control of artificial biomaterial structure and subsequent functionality can be accomplished with level of sophistication that we cannot presently envisage  ultra high temperature ceramics are the ideal materials for extreme conditions owing to their very high melting points and good thermo mechanical properties at high temperatures for these reasons they are widely known as materials for aerospace applications this paper presents comparative spectral characterization of zirconium hafnium and tantalum carbides ultra high temperature ceramics for concentrating solar power applications room temperature reflectance spectra have been measured from the ultraviolet wavelength region to the mid infrared band using these spectral properties the ceramics were evaluated as sunlight absorbers in receivers for high temperature thermodynamic solar plants different concepts for solar receiver systems have been developed in addition also within given approach different solutions are possible for instance if we consider linear parabolic collectors operating at low and medium temperatures they can convert incident solar radiation into heat in different ways the most diffused systems use sunlight absorption by blackened or specially developed absorbing surfaces from which heat is collected and conducted to heat transfer fluid another possibility is the direct absorption of sunlight by heat transfer fluid flowing through transparent tubes black liquid and more recently nanofluid different collector architectures with associated working temperature ranges require tailored systems solutions it is general rule that the efficiency of collector increases with the concentration factor and using turbine the efficiency to produce electricity improves with the working temperature in solar tower plants the heliostat field concentrates the collected sunlight onto the receiver and its high temperature capability strongly determines the system performance several receiver schemes and materials have been studied they can be basically distinguished in three groups receivers with sunlight absorption by particles suspended in gas stream cavity receivers with absorption by bulk material and either employing water steam or molten salt as heat transfer fluid and volumetric receivers with absorption by porous material and heat transfer to gas flowing through it each solution has advantages and drawbacks and the best tradeoff generally depends on the specific application advantages of the proposed bulk absorber cavity scheme are low heat loss easy control high heat capacity and the possibility to exploit mature technologies of conventional fossil fuel power plants ultra high temperature ceramics uhtcs are family of materials including borides carbides and nitrides of hafnium zirconium and tantalum uhtcs are characterized by some of the highest melting points of known materials in particular monocarbides of ta and hf exhibit the highest melting temperatures among every known compound in addition all uhtcs are very hard have good wear resistance mechanical strength good chemical stability strength at high temperatures and high thermal conductivity due to these properties uhtcs are ideal elements for thermal protection systems especially those requiring chemical and structural stability at extremely high operating temperatures nowadays uhtcs are being investigated in the aerospace industry for hypersonic vehicles rocket motor nozzles or atmospheric entry probes compatible with the most extreme entry conditions the ultra high melting points of uhtcs together with the unique combination of good thermal conductivity and chemical stability suggest consideration of these materials for application in solar furnaces for evaluation of the potential of uhtcs as selective sunlight absorbers in solar cavities operating at very high temperatures it is essential to evaluate the spectral absorber properties of these materials the ideal absorber material is spectrally selective with respect to thermal radiation it has low reflectance ideally approaching zero at solar spectrum wavelengths and high reflectance ideally approaching for longer wavelengths the thermal emission spectrum requirements at the transition wavelength range from low to high reflectance change according to the plant operating temperature studies of spectral emissivity characteristics of either bulk or film samples of uhtcs dated back to the and were conducted in the framework of space or military applications due to the intrinsic difficulty to perform high temperature emissivity measurements and to the fact that emissivity strongly depends on the peculiar material composition fabrication method and surface finishing available literature data are difficult to interpret and to compare for example they show different emissivity values for materials produced by different suppliers while they do not give information about several important parameters such as actual material composition densification level surface finishing and porosity in addition available data often refer to different physical quantities total hemispherical total normal or spectral normal emissivities or may show significant disagreement moreover many of the uhtcs are significantly non stoichiometric and the precise compositions and phases are often unclear from the literature while optical properties of films and coatings of some transition metal carbides and nitrides were investigated to the best of the author knowledge reports on optical properties of uhtc carbides are available in the literature only for single crystalline samples of tantalum carbide and zirconium carbide however polycrystalline uhtc carbides are easier to produce than single crystals for solar absorber applications compared to single crystals polycrystalline ceramics are expected to exhibit different optical properties due to light scattering effects from ground boundaries and pores the present paper provides preliminary comparative analysis of several ceramic ultra high temperature carbide materials aimed to identify the most promising for concentrating solar power csp applications we describe the optical characterization of various zirconium hafnium and tantalum carbide based compositions their optical properties are compared to those of more conventional ceramic materials such as sic based ceramics which were used in volumetric solar absorbers room temperature reflectance optical spectra have been measured from ultraviolet uv to mid infrared mir wavelength regions in particular uv to near infrared nir spectra have enabled determination of the sunlight absorbing properties of samples whereas investigations in the mir region have permitted preliminary evaluation of the materials properties as high temperature thermal emitters it should be pointed out that the absorber emissivity properties in the medium infrared band are related to the mir reflectivities these properties are required to evaluate new approaches to increase the operating temperature of thermal solar plants materials commercial powders were used to

track length of mm and with cut off length of mm surface roughness values are reported in table optical reflectance spectra in the wavelength region were acquired using double beam spectrophotometer lambda by perkin elmer equipped with mm diameter integration sphere for the measurement of both the total and purely diffuse reflectance specular reflectance spectra in the wavelength region were acquired using fourier transform ft ir excalibur bio rad spectrophotometer as for the evaluation of relative weight of diffuse versus specular reflectance at first it should be observed that ideal perfectly polished surfaces show only specular reflection whereas real surfaces always have diffuse reflectance component that becomes increasingly negligible as surface roughness decreases and light wavelength increases since our goal was to identify the most promising uhtc families for solar thermal applications the characterization of surface scattering was beyond the scope of the present work for this reason this paper mentions only some basic considerations on surface quality just to be able to estimate the confidence level of acquired specular reflectance spectra to do that we followed the convention applied in the market of optical components that the surface is considered to be an acceptable mirror for the light wavelength if it has peak to valley features with maximum depth on the base of the measured roughness values summarized in table we concluded that all the carbide samples satisfy the criterion for wavelengths longer than to assess the response of our ceramics to the sunlight spectrum we measured both the total hemispherical and the purely diffuse reflectance values in the uv to nir spectral band on the other hand for all samples the mir specular reflectance spectrum can be practically considered as total reflectance within the scope of the present analysis due to the combined effect of surface roughness and light wavelength as already discussed therefore the mir spectra provide useful information about the spectral curve which allows discriminating the spectral behavior of different uhtc families the reflectance of mosi was measured considering that this intermetallic was used as additive for the densification of other ceramics microstructural features of the sintered the uhtc carbide zrc hfc and tac are crystalline compounds of host metal and carbon they have an nacl type structure and are also referred to as interstitial carbides these carbides have the physical properties of ceramics and the electronic properties of metals e high hardness and strength with high thermal and electrical conductivities as well as metal like reflectivity spectra with high expected reflectivity value in the infrared band furthermore they have the highest melting points of any group of materials combined with high thermal and chemical stability some basic properties are summarized in table ii data from ref drawback of this class of materials is the poor resistance to oxidation all these carbides start to readily oxidize at c in air forming porous scales together with large volume expansions cracking and detachment from the substrate on the other hand sic is hard semiconducting material and has been used in ceramics for many years as abrasive wear resistant oxidation resistant and corrosion resistant parts sic is very refractory tending to dissociate at temperatures above for this reason it is currently employed in high temperature structural components in comparison with other carbides sic is quite difficult to densify without additives because of the covalent nature of si bonding and the low self diffusion coefficient in contrast to the uhtc carbides sic has very good oxidation resistance up to due to the development of protective silica layer the typical microstructural features of tested materials are briefly summarized in the next paragraphs starting compositions final densities compositions and surface roughness values are reported in table zrc based materials pure zrc labelled as zc was densified by hot pressing at and is characterized by regular microstructure with equiaxed zrc grains with dimensions around fig residual porosity was vol traces of graphite are visible in the microstructure and are due to contamination in the starting powder the sample labelled as zcm is composite initially containing vol mosi and was sintered by hot pressing at reaching the full density fig during densification complex oxidation and carburization reactions involving spurious oxide phases mosi and resulted in formation of some sic according to ray diffraction and sem eds analyses black contrasting features visible in the polished microstructure were sic particles their amount was estimated through image analysis to be around vol while residual mosi was around vol the sample labelled as zcm fig is composite initially containing vol mosi it was sintered in conventional graphite furnace under an inert gas flux at without application of external pressure the obtained sample density was around mosi amount was higher than vol whilst the amount of formed sic was around vol hfc based materials monolithic sample of hfc was consolidated by hot pressing at reaching final density of this porous sample labelled as hc contains very fine open porosity rounded pores have dimensions usually lower than fig hct is composite material containing vol of tasi and final porosity of about vol fig hcm and hcm are composite materials consolidated by hot pressing at with starting mosi content of and vol and with densities of and respectively figs and in the sintered microstructures the mosi content is very close to the initial composition as confirmed by ray diffraction spectra low amount of sic was also detected by eds analysis vol all the hfc carbide samples contained vol of hafnium oxide due to oxide impurities in the starting powder tac based materials microstructural features of the tac based materials are shown in figs d tc is monolithic material consolidated by hot pressing at and is characterized by fine microstructure and fine porosity and final relative density of fig tc is monolithic material consolidated at and reached much higher density around fig tac grains with size around are recognizable in the microstructure together with an amount of very fine closed porosity with pore dimensions in the range tct is composite material initially containing vol tasi it was consolidated by hot pressing at reaching the full densification in the matrix tasi phase is recognizable as the one with irregular features and slightly darker contrast compared to the matrix fig according to ray diffraction and image analysis the content was estimated to be close to the starting content black features in fig are amorphous phases based on sio arising from reaction of tasi with oxygen species during the sintering cycle their amount is around vol tcm is composite material initially containing vol mosi the material was consolidated by hot pressing at reaching the full densification in the microstructure beside the constituent phases significant fraction of amorphous silica was detected fig according to ray diffraction and image analysis the mosi content was very close to the initial content sic based materials the sic based sample labelled as sc is fully dense monolithic material sintered at with low percentage of c and carbon as sintering agents in the sintered microstructure sic grains around are recognizable along with small fraction of and c impurities fig generally speaking except for pure materials zc hc tc and tc all composites contain major amounts of secondary phases as indicated in table deriving from the addition of sintering agents mosi or tasi these silicides remained mostly confined as distinct grains in the carbide matrices to lesser degree they reacted with oxide species or giving rise to sio or sic species respectively depending on the sintering environment conditions as previously reported concerning the surface preparation it can be observed from table that the ra values are very similar for most of investigated materials finally only for comparative purposes pure mosi material was also analyzed as it is the most widely used secondary phase for the preparation of these carbides optical room temperature optical reflectance spectra of samples under investigation are shown in figs the spectra of sic and mosi are also reported for comparison as they affect the reflectivity profile in the majority of samples as discussed below the reference sic based sample is characterized by the well recognizable reststrahlen reflectance peak at around hollow square symbols in fig on the other hand mosi has main reflectivity minimum at around and secondary minima at around and zrc based materials as for zirconium carbides fig pure zrc zc shows step like reflectivity curve with two minima around and and with no other peaks or additional features in the near and medium infrared in both the zrc based composites spectra namely those of zcm and zc it is possible to identify secondary peak at around wavelength due to the presence of residual sic in the microstructure as it can be easily recognized by comparing their curves to the spectrum of the sic based material this peak is less pronounced in zcm due to the lower amount of sic see table in this sample the spectrum is also affected by the presence of mosi as inferred from the additional minimum around hfc based materials fig reports the reflectivity spectra of hfc based materials pure hafnium carbide hc shows two relative reflectance minima in the uv visible region at around and and monotonic reflectivity increase towards the infrared zone with small feature around a similar uv vis spectrum is shown by the sample hc produced with the tasi sintering aid as for the samples produced with the mosi sintering aid the one with the highest amount hcm shows the typical mosi reflectance shoulder at around thus confirming that the presence of silicide residuals in the amount of vol or higher affects the optical spectrum as for the dependence of reflectivity characteristics on porosity fig compares materials with similar surface finishing levels but with different densities see table besides the discussed differences in the spectral distribution due to the use of mosi or tasi as sintering aids the absolute values of reflectance for all samples with densities higher than appear similar while the reflectivity of highest porosity samples is lower this means that samples with porosities up to actually behave in similar way if the optical reflectivity is concerned however for larger differences in porosity like those shown by hc it is reasonable to deduce reflectivity decrease as the porosity increases or equivalently as the density decreases in fact it seems reasonable to expect some light trapping like effects due to surface pores tac based materials the reflectivity curves of pure tac tc and tc samples in fig show reflectivity minimum at around which was detected for all tac based materials monotonic reflectivity increase up to then lower slope increase up to around and finally nearly constant reflectivity plateau for longer wavelengths the different reflectivity values of tc and tc could be likely ascribed to porosity effect see sec iv as for the doped samples the spectrum confirms the presence of mosi residuals in the tcm sample the pronounced shoulder in the reflectivity curve of this sample at around if compared to those of pure tac the tcm and tct samples have similar density and respectively they have been produced with different sintering aids mosi for tcm and tasi for tct the spectrum of tct shows pronounced rise edge below with no concavity change for longer wavelengths it can be observed that the presence of significant fractions of tasi in the final sample does not seem to affect the spectral curve which is different from that of mosi containing sample regarding the effect on reflectance of sample porosity the values are very similar for densities higher than while the values for lower density samples were significantly lower as it was also found with the hfc compositions this means that about of porosity difference e for samples with and densities respectively does not significantly alter the optical reflectivity on the other hand the significantly higher porosity of tc results in reflectivity decrease as general conclusions of this optical characterization it is apparent from figs that ultra refractory carbides such as zrc hfc and tac materials behave very differently from sic sic only has well recognizable reflectance peak at around of wavelength with slight reflectivity decrease from to in agreement with some of the samples analyzed in ref on the contrary all uhtcs even with some differences among them selves display step like increase of reflectance from visible to infrared with presence of wavelength reflectance cutoff the difference in the shape of reflectivity curves of uhtcs with respect to that of sic arises from their different energy level structure uhtcs have metal like electronic structure that from the point of view of optical characteristics generates smooth spectral reflectivity curve which increases almost monotonically from vis to infrared and shows high value of reflectivity plateau for wide spectral range in the infrared region on the other hand the semiconducting character of sic is connected to the existence of discrete vibrational states arising in big steps in the reflectivity curve with sudden changes from very low to very high reflectivity values for uhtcs the wavelengths corresponding to reflectance of of the respective peak value are listed in table iii zirconium carbide based samples have cutoff wavelengths roughly around and while tantalum carbide based materials show cutoff in the visible range roughly around for all the investigated density levels hafnium carbide based sample show larger variability in the cutoff wavelengths as they range from for the dense hcm to for the porous pure sample hc for single sample of this series hcm the measurement of the spectrum in the uv visible range was not possible because of the very small specimen size good absorber for solar furnace is material providing low ratio between thermal emittance and solar absorbance at the operating temperatures for opaque materials like in our case in all cases we measured transmittance values lower than in the wavelength range from to with sample thicknesses of few millimeters the kirchoff law applies therefore the directional spectral emissivity is equal to the directional spectral absorptivity and for the energy conservation it is given by where is the spectral directional hemispherical reflectivity e the spectral reflectivity measured for light coming from single incidence direction and for light reflected into the whole half space in front of the surface like measurements performed with an integrating sphere the directional emissivity in the wavelength range is related to the spectral directional emissivity by the equation d d where is the blackbody spectral radiance the total solar directional absorptivity of the sample is calculated integrating the spectral directional absorptivity on the sun emission spectrum according to the equation min max d min max d hence we can conclude that the measurement of spectral reflectivity is the starting point to estimate both sunlight absorption and thermal emission characteristics of samples it should be noticed that for precise assessment of the material potential in solar furnaces the characterization of the spectral behavior must be done at the furnace operating temperature that is expected to be lower than notice that the materials requirements for volumetric solar absorber are resistance to temperatures of about since high temperature reflectivity or emissivity measurements require the use of complex apparatuses and long measurement times preliminary choice among the various materials to identify the most promising ones is absolutely mandatory and this was the purpose of the present work in fact literature data on many different materials metals semiconductors dielectrics show that if the material does not undergo phase or surface changes the spectral reflectivity or emissivity curve shapes do not dramatically change in this case the curves showed changes in intensity while retaining the qualitative shape of the room temperature curve therefore shaped curves do not translate into band structures and conversely even if for curves of the former type change in the cutoff spectral position can be expected from the acquired hemispherical reflectance spectra we calculated the room temperature solar directional absorptivity according to eq using as the cie sun spectrum with air mass ref and min max the calculated values of are listed in table iv tac based materials show the lowest solar absorptivity with similar values lying around for all samples independently from sample porosity and sintering aid used during synthesis zrc based samples have slightly higher solar absorptivity somewhat higher than with the maximum value obtained for the pure dense sample zc and with no differences between the two other investigated samples both being nearly fully dense and with mosi addition hfc based materials show higher spread among the investigated samples among uhtcs the best solar absorber is hc with solar hemispherical absorptivity near to even higher than that of silicon carbide sc about from these calculations even if they were performed on room temperature spectra as explained we can conclude that for utchs the spectral features in the wavelength region of solar spectrum strongly depend on the base material with practically no dependence on the sintering aid except for the hfc case that needs additional investigations as for the effect of sample porosity it seems that solar absorptivity is higher if the sample density is lower than about with no absorptivity dependence on porosity for density values in the range porosities even if it seems reasonable to expect some light trapping effects within the surface pores the study of optical properties on higher range of porosity levels is needed to obtain conclusive results about this effect so it will be the subject of further investigations when the comparison between sic and carbide uhtcs is concerned sic appears better solar absorber owing to its lower vis nir reflectivity uhtcs are expected to show lower thermal emissivity than silicon carbide thanks to their higher reflectivity in the medium infrared region thus to have also qualitative estimation of the expected thermal emissivity of samples we calculated from the acquired spectra the directional emissivity in the wavelength range using eq in the calculation we considered as the blackbody spectrum at results are summarized in table iv the lowest emissivity lower than is shown by tac based dense materials while the majority of zrc based samples show values around like in the solar absorptivity calculation hfc based samples show spread of emissivity values ranging from about to for dense pellets and about for the porous one in general samples with significant porosity have considerably larger thermal emissivity than similar dense materials see tc and hc cases as expected sic has by far the largest thermal emissivity among the materials under study corresponding to ratio of about these qualitative considerations are confirmed by recent high temperature measurements reporting for zrc tac and hfc considerable lower emissivity than sic it should be noticed that for solar receiver applications low thermal emissivity is very important parameter as it governs radiative thermal losses in the heated absorber and thus the maximum allowable operating temperature moreover uhtcs have satisfactory thermo mechanical properties at high temperature equivalently to sic on the other hand possible concerns for the use of carbides for this application are poor resistance to oxidation which implies their use under vacuum or inert atmosphere and current high costs of raw materials especially for hfc powders from these very preliminary considerations it appears clear that the quantitative assessment of uhtc performances for this new solar application is very complex task that includes the evaluation of several parameters in this work we give basic evaluation of the spectrally selective characteristics of uhtcs together with the identification of the most relevant parameters to take into account for the proposed application the final identification of the best performing material necessarily needs complex high temperature measurements and choice between different tradeoffs when the comparison between uhtcs and sic is concerned it should be noticed that although thermo mechanical requirements are equivalently satisfied by both classes of ceramics the more favorable optical characteristics and above all the low emissivity at high temperatures of ultra refractory carbides seem to be the most important advantage with respect to sic that has been evidenced by this study this work examined the intrinsic spectral selectivity of different carbide samples of uhtcs for new applications as sunlight absorbers in tower solar plants the investigation has been performed in the wavelength range from to which allows showing high intrinsic spectral selectivity for the majority of tested samples as they reach low reflectivity at the wavelengths of solar emission and high reflectivity at the wavelengths of thermal infrared directional solar absorptivity has been calculated for most of them showing that for given carbide type the use of sintering aids does not affect the solar absorber features nevertheless the various investigated carbide families showed distinctive features in the uv vis spectra that result in different performances in the field of sunlight absorption among the investigated materials the highest value of solar absorptivity has been measured for hafnium carbide based porous samples while the lowest corresponds to dense tantalum carbide directional emissivity in the wavelength range has been calculated as well allowing to expect from uhtcs considerably lower emissivity with respect to the reference sic ceramics these results will be cross compared with high temperature emissivity investigations for quantitative assessment of uhtc potentialities and performances as solar absorbers and solar energy storage materials  the methylammonium lead halide perovskites have shown significant promise as low cost second generation photovoltaic material despite recent advances however there are still number of fundamental aspects of their formation as well as their physical and electronic behavior that are not well understood in this letter we explore the mechanism by which these materials crystallize by testing the outcome of each of the reagent halide salts we find that components of both salts lead halide and methylammonium halide are relatively mobile and can be readily exchanged during the crystallization process when the reaction is carried out in solution or in the solid state we exploit this fact by showing that the perovskite structure is formed even when the lead salt anion is non halide leading to lower annealing temperature and time requirements for film formation studies into these behaviors may ultimately lead to improved processing conditions for photovoltaic films for many crystalline semiconductors the ability to grow large oriented grains is essential for high performance this ability is enabled in part by fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which the crystal forms the methylammonium lead halide perovskites mapbx where ma nh ch i or cl have recently shown great promise as class of photovoltaic materials that can yield high efficiency devices using low cost processing methods power conversion efficiencies of these devices are enhanced by the control of perovskite film coverage and crystallinity we have previously reported three stages of structural evolution in the perovskite formation via one step solution processing route an unidentified crystalline precursor structure the perovskite structure and decomposition products specifically the transition from the precursor structure to the perovskite structure is intriguing since it indicates solid state transformation in this letter we show that the perovskite structure forms via complete dissociation and rearrangement of all reagent halide salts under both solution and solid state conditions based on this knowledge we explore alternative synthetic routes with the ultimate goal of finding more favorable processing conditions for the formation of the desired perovskite structure the formation of thin films of mapbx can be accomplished through several processing routes as shown schematically in figure various groups have reported one step deposition method fig that consists of mixing lead halide salt pbx i cl and methylammonium halide salt max i cl in common solvent and depositing the solution on substrate upon thermal annealing the solvent is removed and the perovskite structure is formed common pathway for this type of crystallization from solution is by the rearrangement of constituent ions however for solid state transitions there are other viable pathways to consider such as the topotactic transformation of one or more of the constituent salts determining the pathway by which the perovskite forms has implications both in terms of potential processing conditions as well as providing means by which the role of other components such as spectator species can be explored in order to decouple the disposition of the reagent salts we adopted two step process in which we deposited the lead salt by thermal evaporation followed by soaking the films in solution of methylammonium halides dissolved in isopropanol fig due to the minimal solubility of lead halides in isopropanol this processing route has the lead halide in the solid state during the crystallization it is important to note the solubility of the resulting perovskite is negligible in isopropyl alcohol ipa but quite high in water mandating the use of water free environment for this experimental path we varied the deposited lead halide species and the molar ratios of the methylammonium halides mai and macl as summarized in table we note that given the lead salt film thickness and the volume of solution used there is an approximately fold excess of methylammonium halide in the solution compared to the lead halide on the substrate leaving lead as the only limiting reagent in the reaction preliminary experiments on thin lead halide films nm showed that delamination from the substrate occurred prior to complete formation of the perovskite to mitigate this effect thick lead halide films were used thereby simultaneously avoiding delamination and ensuring thick enough perovskite layers for characterization in order to maintain the structure as formed in the thin film without excluding structural elements due to texturing we performed grazing incidence wide angle ray scattering giwaxs directly on those films figure shows the azimuthally integrated intensity plots of the resulting two dimensional data sets previous studies including energy dispersive ray spectroscopy edx and ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps have shown that cl can only be incorporated into the iodide structure at very low concentrations additionally for the mixed halide systems that do form continuous solid solution br and cl br there is systematic shift in both the lattice parameter and the optical band gap given these facts we used the ray patterns and or absorption data to determine the primary structure formed although this does not determine the purity of the structure small inclusions of the secondary halide do not impact the assessment of the extent of the dissociation rearrangement of the reagent salts as summarized in table the scattering patterns reveal that the final perovskite structure contains the halide species dominant in the solution regardless of the starting lead halide film this result suggests that the lead halide needs to dissociate and exchange freely with the methylammonium halide ions during the process of the perovskite formation based on the observed behavior of ion rearrangement as well as results of an earlier study in which we reported the existence of structurally unidentified precursor phase prior to the perovskite it is clear that the pathway of the system to the final perovskite structure is rather complex and deserves further study we note that the crystallization times and crystal morphologies vary with the lead halide source for lead chloride films the soaking time required to obtain the perovskite was compared to for the lead iodide films sem and giwaxs data see the supplementary material show that lead iodide films lead to perovskite structures with much smaller crystals better coverage and higher degree of crystallographic orientation the most highly textured films based on the giwaxs data are samples and both of which start with pbi and transform to mapbi figs a and c of the supplementary material from the sem image fig a of the supplementary material of this texture appears to be the result of the homogeneity of both the size and shape of the crystallites which leads to better packing and orientational order of the individual grains the slower growth of the corresponding pbcl sample leads to crystals that are larger and more polydisperse in both size and shape the sem image fig b of the supplementary material shows sparse coverage and random orientation of the individual crystals causing less textured scattering pattern fig d of the supplementary material we next turned our attention to the outcome of the ma salt and the question of whether the individual ions of the ma halide stay associated or not the reverse version of the above soaking experiment e soaking solid state max films in pbx solutions is impractical as the lead halides are only appreciably soluble in solvents that will also solvate the perovskite however we can explore the disposition of the ma salt in the solid state by using two step sublimation process similar to that reported by chen et al in which the lead salt is deposited first and the ma salt introduced by sublimation for many ionic salts specifically ammonium salts it has been shown that sublimation at lower temperatures produces molecular units in the vapor phase as opposed to dissociated ions we therefore assume that the sublimed species is g molecular mai which then condenses onto the lead salt film followed by the crystallization of the perovskite this process is solid state reaction with no background solvent present thin films nm of lead chloride were first evaporated onto glass substrates the films were placed on hotplate at together with small volume of mai salt and covered with funnel to allow for saturation with mai vapor see fig the films began to turn brown at the edges in and were completely brown after comparison of the xrd spectrum fig to the known peak positions for mapbi confirms that the iodide perovskite structure was formed the inset of figure presents the absorption spectrum of the final film exhibiting band gap also consistent with the iodide perovskite given that the lead halide was pbcl the stoichiometry dictates that the mai must have dissociated to form the resulting perovskite the results therefore suggest that all ions dissociate not only when the reaction is performed in solution but also when both salts are present in the solid state with no solvent present the crystallization pathway reported here raises several interesting questions these questions include among others are there possible routes to templating the crystal growth via the individual constituent ions does this pathway help elucidate the role of spectator species in mediating the dissociation of the reagents how sensitive is the formation of the final perovskite to the source of the constituent ions we explore one of these ideas as further validation of our findings and to demonstrate the application of these results to finding alternative processing pathways if the lead cation loses all association with its corresponding anions during the crystallization process then the crystallization should be insensitive to the lead source to verify the insensitivity to the lead counter ions and to test the impact of the lead source on processing conditions we prepared film using lead nitrate pb no non halide lead source wt solution of pb no and mai in stoichiometric ratio was prepared in n dimethylformamide dmf and spin cast onto glass substrate at rpm for seconds after spin casting the substrate was placed on hotplate and ramped from room temperature to at min these are the same conditions that we have previously reported for the mixed halide of pbcl mai in dmf except that in the mixed halide system the total post deposition treatment consisted of the ramp to followed by min of annealing at that temperature in our tests with pb no based solutions the films turned brown at min into the temperature ramp corresponding to temperature of only figure shows the xrd pattern absorption data and optical images of perovskite films with pb no as the lead source the ray diffraction and absorbance data fig confirm that mapbi is formed the faster formation of the perovskite at lower temperatures is likely the result of the spectator species mano the excess component that exists as result of the non stoichiometric reagents in solution in the mixed halide system used by several groups with pbcl mai in ratio the excess component is macl p which is less volatile then mano p although the relationship between volatility and lower annealing temperatures is unclear it does provide potential alternate processing paths such as spray coating the optical images in figs d were taken from spray coated films prepared in identical ways at different times these micrographs reveal two important features high sensitivity of the resulting film morphology to subtle changes in the growth conditions like environmental humidity which was not controlled in these experiments the various morphologies that can be achieved including spherulites fig dendrites fig and large faceted crystals fig because the annealing temperature was well below that used for films made from pbcl in which the excess salt has been reported to be removed by sublimation during annealing we checked to ensure that the excess salt mano was completely removed to that end additional films were made and the presence of no probed by ftir after which the films were soaked for min in ipa then rinsed thoroughly with ipa and probed again the resulting spectra figure of the supplementary materials show that no is still present in the films after annealing but that it is completely removed by washing these results suggest that crystallization of the perovskite can occur in the presence of excess organic salt in conclusion we have probed the disposition of both reagent salts used in the processing of mapbx thin films and showed that the crystallization occurs via rearrangement of all constituent ions irrespective of whether the reaction is performed in solution or in the solid state we have noted several implications of this crystallization mechanism and demonstrated that one of those the choice of the lead counter ion can be exploited to effect the annealing time and temperature necessary to form the final product the results suggest that fundamental materials research as shown here targeted at understanding the crystallization mechanisms may ultimately help elucidate improved processing conditions leading to thin films of perovskites with optimized crystal size and orientation which in turn may give rise to enhanced opto electronic properties  the ultrashort duration of laser driven multi mev ion bursts offers the possibility of radiobiological studies at extremely high dose rates employing the taranis terawatt laser at queen university the effect of proton irradiation at mev range energies on live cells has been investigated at dose rates exceeding gy as single exposure clonogenic assay showed consistent lethal effects on live cells which even at these dose rates appear to be in line with previously published results employing conventional sources relative biological effectiveness rbe of at survival is estimated from comparison with kvp ray source the use of ion beams in cancer radiotherapy exploits the advantageous energy deposition properties of ions as compared to more commonly used rays unlike rays ions are able to deliver lethal amount of doses into the target tumour while limiting harm to the surrounding healthy tissues hadron therapy has been widely recognized across the globe and several clinical facilities employing mainly protons from synchrotron cyclotron or linac accelerators are operational and routinely treating significant number of patients unfortunately the cost and size of these facilities relative to megavoltage linac sources are beyond the scope of typical hospital and limit both the widespread use of proton treatments as well as employment of heavier ion beams the idea of future facilities based on laser driven ion accelerators has been proposed as way of reducing complexity and cost significant effort is ongoing to demonstrate the ion beam parameters required to make this proposition viable in the meanwhile several groups have started preliminary work on the methodology and viability of using laser driven ion source for cell irradiation experiments the main aim of these investigations is to establish procedure for cell handling irradiation and dosimetry compatible with laser plasma interaction environment furthermore one of the peculiarities of laser driven ion beams is their ultrashort duration as ions are emitted in bursts of picosecond duration at the source and their therapeutic use may result in dose rates many orders of magnitude higher than normally used the radiobiology at ultra high dose rates is virtually unknown and warrants investigation of the biological effect of these ultrashort pulses at the cellular level in previous studies of dose dependent cell damage employing ion bursts accelerated by fs laser systems g in ref doses in the gy range have been delivered to the cells in several fractions although each pulse delivered fraction of gray in short time tens of ns the average dose rate over gy level exposure was in the gy range e not dissimilar from the dose rate normally used in radiobiology with conventional proton sources in this paper we report for the first time quantitative study of dose dependent biological effects of mev protons on cells chinese hamster cell line in the ultra high dose rate regime gy with the dose up to gy delivered in single exposure the experiment was carried out at the queen university of belfast qub using the multi terawatt chirped pulse amplified cpa laser system taranis this is ti sapphire nd glass laser working at wavelength of nm with pulse duration of fs and beam energy of up to the laser was focused by f off axis parabola oap on al foils leading to an intensity on target of order cm in this intensity regime the protons are created from the rear surface of the target by the well known target normal sheath acceleration mechanism tnsa which leads to broadband proton energy spectra typically with particle numbers exponentially decreasing up to cut off energy the particles are typically emitted under full angle of at mev energies decreasing to degrees near the cut off as detailed in ref ps laser irradiation typically leads to high particle numbers allowing for example number densities up to mev sr at mev this allows high doses to be attained in single shot when irradiating cell sample an aperture slit wide was located mm behind the foil and dipole magnet mm long with maximum field strength of was placed mm behind the slit in order to deflect the protons and disperse them according to their energies prior to the cell irradiation see fig due to the relatively large entrance slit each point was irradiated by protons within certain energy range see fig for details the protons exited the vacuum chamber though m thick mylar window which stopped protons with energies lower than mev the distance from the window to the magnets output is mm with the cell dish placed cm from the window the deflection angle of mev protons with respect to the direct source aperture line of sight is about and larger for lower energies which avoids cell spot irradiation by unwanted ray radiation from the target collected through the aperture customized gafchromic films ebt where the overlaminate and adhesive layers normally preceding the active layer were not present were used directly behind the cell dish for dosimetry the ebt films were previously calibrated using the cyclotron at the university of birmingham prior to cell irradiation an experimental characterization of the proton spectrum at the cell locations was performed by ebt stack dosimetry using number of layers in stack configuration it was possible at the same time to obtain the spatial proton energy distribution on the rcf films e the cell dots plane and the energy deposition characteristics monte carlo simulations of the proton propagation through the experimental configuration have been done using the fluka code by the simulation we can closely reproduce the proton spectrum we observe on the films and then reconstruct the number and spatial distribution of protons impacting on each cell spot further details of the dosimetric procedure and of method employed to reconstruct the proton spectrum incident onto the cells can be found in ref these energy characteristics result in few ns duration of the proton bunch impacting on the cells the irradiation was performed on the radiosensitive chinese hamster fibroblast cells cell line whose nuclei have dimensions of in diameter and in thickness the cells were cultivated in dulbecco minimum essential medium lonza uk containing fbs fetal bovine serum lonza uk glutamine lonza uk and penicillin streptomycin invitrogen ltd uk during any preparation of the cells either pre irradiation or post irradiation laminar flow cabinet or biosafety hood were used to avoid contamination from micro organisms the cells were seeded hours before irradiation on m thick mylar sheet in order to give them time to multiply and attach to the substrate the cell dots e disks of about mm diameter were then cut from the mylar sheet and placed in mm diameter dish plate over m mylar film six disks were placed in each irradiated cell dish two disks were used as controls which were not irradiated during the laser shot while the proton irradiation was performed simultaneously on four cell dots taking advantage of the proton energy spread across the cell plane the position of the cell dots with respect to the proton distribution on the plane could be easily identified on the films from the shadow projected by the mylar disks the dose released on the cell dots could be reconstructed directly by monitoring the rcf signal above and below the shadow of the disks this approach allows us to target each dot with different doses ranging from fraction of gy to few gys in single irradiation with individual assessment of the dose delivered to each cell dot spectral profiles within the different dots for one of the configurations used during the experiments are shown in fig after the irradiation each cell dot was immersed into trypsin to detach the cells from the mylar support and then diluted in prepared solution of medium and trypsin the cells were counted by hemocytometer and known number of cells was plated into three petri dishes these were kept in an incubator in an atmosphere of co and humidity at for about week in this environment the cells which didn experience lethal damage can start the process of repair post irradiation and then multiply forming cell colonies after the incubation period the petri dishes were stained with crystal violet to highlight the colonies making them visible as violet dots which can then be easily counted the surviving fractions sf were calculated as sf num of colonies num of cultured cell pe where pe is the plating efficiency finally for comparison cell samples prepared according to the same procedure were irradiated with an ray source xrad kvp from pxi inc shielded by mm thick cu filter to cut off the low energy part of the spectrum dosimetry for the ray exposures was performed using farmer chamber cross calibrated to secondary standard detector the resulting survival curve is shown in fig where the data has been fitted using linear quadratic model the cells were irradiated with doses ranging from to gy the uncertainty in dose is mainly due to the finite size mm of the cell dots while the error bars of the sf refer to the uncertainty associated with the method used in processing the cells and it is about of the data point value the survival curve obtained with protons shows the expected higher biological efficiency of protons with respect to rays from the comparison between proton and ray data relative biological effectiveness rbe of can be calculated at sf direct comparison with results available in the literature is not straightforward as the points in the curve are obtained using different cell dots irradiated at central energies in the range mev however the rbe value obtained is in the range of published values for mev proton inactivation of cells in particular folkard et al obtain rbes at sf which range from to for proton energies monochromatic in the range mev corresponding to linear energy transfers let of kev a rbe of is obtained for let of kev mev energies in fig the points of the proton survival curve of fig are grouped according to their let the let for each of the proton data point is here considered as volume averaged value on the cells obtained using the energy spectrum associated with the corresponding cell dot as done for example in ref the monte carlo code srim is used for simulating the energy deposited let in the cell monolayer according to the proton spectrum and the uncertainty in the let is given by one standard error of the mean the survival rates observed are in line with published results obtained using conventional sources as plotted in fig in this figure sf data taken with peak energy of mev kev let and mev kev let are compared with data obtained at similar energy or similar let using conventional proton irradiation of cells the data indicates that at the dose levels investigated the ultrahigh dose rate employed has no significant effect on cell survival all be it that the cell handling methodologies were different this is an encouraging result in view of potential future therapeutic use of ultrashort bursts of laser driven ions as in realistic arrangements proton pulse durations on the cells will be of ns order or more as employed in the measurements reported here we note that similar conclusions on independence of survival results from dose rate although employing different cell line and protons with different let have been very recently reached in experiments employing pulsed ion microbeam operating at similar dose rates and pulse durations as in the experiment presented here we believe that with an optimized set up it will be possible in the near future to increase the dose rate deliverable by laser accelerated protons by further orders of magnitude which will allow testing for the emergence of collective effects as predicted in ref  we report the design and implementation of capacitive detection and control of microfluidic droplets in microfluidic devices integrated microfluidic chip with detection control circuit enables us to monitor in situ the individual volume of droplets ranging from nanoliter to picoliter velocity and even composition with an operation frequency of several kilohertz through electronic feedback we are able to easily count sort and direct the microfluidic droplets potential applications of this approach can be employed in the areas of biomicrofluidic processing microchemical reactions as well as digital microfluidics droplets in miniaturized microfluidic systems have received much focused attention recently chemical reactions and biotesting can benefit from many advantages afforded by the tiny droplets ranging from nano to picoliters in volume mixing of liquids is much easier in droplets than in continuous microflows for biosensing testing accurate control can be achieved by conveying reagents in discrete volumes in the forms of droplets which also allows single cell manipulations as well as better statistics multiple emulsions or structured drops can offer even more functionalities such as polymerization processing and encapsulation of droplets for targeted delivery and release generation and manipulation of droplets involve discontinuous pressure changes g during droplet fusion and or fission or the droplet formation process from the continuous phase drop size and distance may vary spatially and temporally hence real time detection of droplets is critical for accurate control up to now optical detection methods are the most widely used g using either photodiode for simple counting or high speed charge coupled device ccd camera with image processing for detection of more detailed characteristics in this paper we report the design and implementation of capacitive detection and control of microfluidic droplets in microchannels capacitive sensors are common in the mems community widely used in acceleration and pressure sensing in biosensing coulter counter has been used for counting and sizing particles and or cells capacitive sensor was used to detect the electrical trapping of yeast cells onto gold electrodes in microfluidic channel capacitive cytometry was also used in measuring the dna content in biological cells our approach differs from those mentioned above by installing pair of parallel electrodes across the microfluidic channel very small variations in the capacitance can be detected when droplet passes through due to the electrode design and feedback electronic circuit real time and accurate determination of size shape and composition of droplets with volumes ranging from pico to nanoliter has been demonstrated the operational frequency can reach up to khz speed which is difficult to realize by conventional optical means thus capacitive measurement of droplets has the potential to be simple fast and less expensive than the standard laser flow cytometry moreover it can be used in portable lab chips for in situ detection and control of droplets microfluidic chip as shown in fig has main flow channel on which several pairs of parallel electrodes are located two or more inlet channels carrying two or more immiscible liquids in which one is the carrying liquid and the other is for generating the droplets are merged at the inlet junction the droplets with the carrying stream are shown to flow through several pairs of electrodes intended for detection and manipulation parallel electrodes are located on the side walls of the channel capacitance change is induced when droplet passes through pair of electrodes shown schematically in owing to the dielectric constant contrast between the droplet and the carrying fluid thus dielectric constant difference between the two liquids is prerequisite for capacitive sensing but this is generally the case in microfluidic systems g water oil emulsions surface patterning of thin layer electrode is widely used in microfluidic chips however it is not easy to fabricate two parallel electrodes on the opposite sides of microchannel as multilayer bonding is almost inevitable in order to solve this problem we employ multistage process depicted in fig to fabricate the microfluidic chip with embedded parallel electrodes figure shows the flow chart of the fabrication procedure where the photolithography of negative photoresist su is first used to fabricate m wide flow channel mold with height m positive photoresist az is then spin coated on the mold and patterned by another photolithographic process to yield cross sectional profile shown on the second row of fig the thickness of az should be larger than su therefore triple coatings are needed and the soft bake process is prolonged accordingly in order for the az layer to reform smooth surface in the third step cavities formed in the az layer are filled with ag pdms gel which is mixture of micro nano ag particles with pdms gel the cured ag pdms composite has excellent electrical conductivity tested conductivity is above m after baking at for min and curing of ag pdms the remaining az is dissolved in acetone and then the mold is gently washed in ethanol and di water the mold is then baked at for min to evaporate the remaining organic solvent in order to easily separate pdms layer from mold nonstick thin film should be first deposited on the mold by evaporating silane in desiccator in the fourth step pdms gel is poured on the mold and then cured after releasing cured pdms layer is formed with conductive ag pdms electrodes on two sides of the microchannel shown as the fifth step the cover layer of the chip is sheet of pdms however patterned ito glass can also be used as the cover bonded to the channel layer with plasma treatment final one hour baking at is needed to stabilize the conductivity of the ag pdms electrodes and the connecting lines figure shows the optical image of the chip after the third fabrication step enlarged views of the detection and sorting areas are shown in figs and respectively to form droplets in microchannels the carrying fluid should preferentially wet the channel wall and the interfacial tension between the droplet phase and the carrying fluid should be lower than that between the droplet phase and the channel wall once the droplet is formed the droplet will flow downstream encapsulated by layer of the carrying fluid the most commonly used carrying fluid is either silicone oil hexadecane or perfluorinated liquid all electrically insulating with relatively low dielectric constants compared to water in our experiments we employ aqueous droplets in silicone oil since the pdms channel wall can be easily wetted by silicone oil the two parallel electrodes cannot be electrically shorted by the aqueous droplets plugs verifiable through resistance measurements using an impedance analyzer an experimental setup shown in fig was built to test our capacitive detection scheme the microfluidic chip was mounted directly on the circuit board fig together with syringe pump kdscientific used to push different liquids into the chip an electric shield not shown in the picture for the whole chip as well as shielded electric lines for high voltage control were employed so as to minimize noise and signal loss capacitance signals were collected by labview card the labview program can further drive high voltage switches to output control signals for droplet sorting the detection circuit board with the chip shown in fig was mounted on the platform of microscope olympus a high speed ccd camera pco was used to record the images for comparison and checking detection circuit board is based on the resonance mechanism and consists of four parts shown in the lower part of fig an ac waveform generator that can output waveform with adjustable amplitude and frequency l resonance circuit where the capacitor comes from the parallel electrodes in the chip an amplifier and an ac dc converter that output voltage peaks to correspond with the passing droplets supplementary comparator is included to output square wave signals for in situ feedback control of the droplets single droplet for the l resonance circuit the voltage amplitude on the inductor is given by ym c where is the angular frequency and ym denotes the maximum amplitude of when water droplet passes through the electrodes dielectric constant of the media between the electrodes changes as oil water oil v where is the volume of water between the electrodes and is the total volume of the fluids between the electrodes correspondingly capacitance varies as t coil cwater coil v coil denotes the capacitance when all of the media is oil cwater denotes the capacitance when all of the media is water by using an impedance analyzer hp we have tested the capacitance rise to be pf when long di water droplet fills the gap between the electrodes the parasitic capacitance of the circuit was measured to be pf by adjusting the resonance frequency to that when the parallel electrodes is filled with water then the relationship of ym to the ratio v of droplet volume to the volume between the electrodes can be depicted as the solid line in fig in accordance with eq it is noted that the relationship is nonlinear therefore the droplet size calibration is not as straightforward as linear relationship but the tested signals are highly selective in accordance to the volume of the droplet hence the detected signals can be used in droplet sorting small change in volume can result in relatively large change in the signal especially if the signal is close to the peak value the sharpness of the peak can be evaluated by the quality factor cr figure shows three snapshots of three separate droplets with different lengths passing through the electrodes with flow rate being the same for the three cases detected signals are displayed in fig for case where the droplet length ld is larger than that of electrode le the velocity of the droplet can be deduced by le while the length of droplet is ld t however for case where the droplet length ld le the velocity of the droplet is given by le t with ld vt here t and are all defined in fig it is noted that the testing results shown in fig are approximately symmetric corresponding to droplets with well developed shapes and profiles however if droplet has nonuniform profile g caused by surface charge or flow asymmetry its scanned signal can display an asymmetric waveform figure gives snapshot of series of droplets with different sizes upper panel together with their corresponding scanned signals lower panel we have also calibrated the correlation of the detected signal magnitude with the droplet size to be the detection rate can reach up to droplets sec where khz in our experiment in our tests we have detected at hz as shown in fig for the actual droplets and the corresponding signals shown in fig here the limitation is not the detection rate but rather the sustainable pressure for our pdms chip above which the chip breaks from the inlets ports figure depicts square waveform output from the comparator for the feedback control that was introduced in sec ii simplified electrode structure for droplet from fig it is seen that similar output signal waveforms were observed for both big and small droplets the only difference is in their amplitudes to measure the droplet size two pairs of electrodes are needed by which the velocity can be deduced directly by evaluating the time interval of the droplet passing from one pair of electrodes to the next in fig we show that single pair of fork shaped electrodes can perform the same task when droplet passes through fork shape electrodes figs and it is seen that corresponding to the consecutive time images of the big fig and small fig droplets passing through the fork electrodes two plateau regions would appear on the scanned waveform as shown in fig for the two cases but the two waveforms are very different for big droplet with ld le peak in the middle can be identified but for the small droplet with ld le dip appears hence the droplet size and velocity can be easily detected simultaneously with only one pair of fork shaped electrodes droplet because the chemical composition of the reagent is related directly to the dielectric constant of the droplets the capacitance and resonance caused by different droplet compositions can give rise to significantly different signal amplitudes to test our experimental setup for detecting droplets with different dielectric constants water and ethylene glycol were used as reagents with dielectric constant of and respectively at two channels were applied to generate droplets with similar size by controlling the mass flow rate with two syringe pumps as shown in fig the di water dark and ethylene glycol light droplets are seen to give very different signal amplitudes seen in fig directional flow control of droplet control and sorting according to size and content is challenging but important task in microfluidics weitz reported the fusion of droplets with different electrical charges with directional flow control of the droplets from feedback of light detection from our testing experiments described above the capacitive signals in our approach can be used directly in the real time manipulation of droplets in accordance with their size and content figure shows schematically the feedback loop for the directional flow control of droplets velocity size and or content of the droplets were first determined with electrode the delay time for the droplet to reach the subsequent control electrodes is automatically adjusted in accordance with the velocity and channel length electrode is connected to high voltage with positive potential while the polarizations of electrodes and are determined by the output signal of electrode for example when droplet arrives at the intersection it can be either attracted or repelled into one of the two branches depending on the polarization of electrodes and as seen in figs and if electrode is charged positive the droplets will turn to the upper channel as can be seen in fig the opposite situation is noted in fig the minimum required effective electric field for directional flow control is mm set by the hydrodynamic flow resistance at the junction for v mm the water droplets are stretched into tiny satellite droplets figure shows snapshot of droplet sorting according to composition here dark drops denotes water droplets while light drops are ethylene glycol we present capacitive detection of microfluidic droplets based on the dielectric constant contrast between the droplets and the carrying fluid such detection is very sensitive accurate and fast and needs no special sample preparation the tested capacitance signals can be used directly for in situ labeling sorting and droplet manipulation therefore this approach can be used in portable lab chips for environmental monitoring and biofunctionalities as well as in high throughput microchemical reactions and digital microfluidics  the performance characteristics of new synchrotron ray powder diffraction beamline at the diamond light source are presented using an in vacuum undulator for photon production and deploying simple ray optics centered around double crystal monochromator and pair of harmonic rejection mirrors high brightness and low bandpass ray beam is delivered at the sample to provide fast data collection si analyzing crystals and detectors are installed onto large and high precision diffractometer high resolution powder diffraction data from standard reference materials of si quartz and lab are used to characterize instrumental performance since many naturally occurring and manufactured materials exist in powder or polycrystalline forms high resolution ray powder diffraction beamlines are available at nearly every synchrotron facility world wide the exceptionally bright e intense and highly collimated ray beams delivered to these instruments allows data to be collected with quality and resolution not attainable using more conventional sources in third generation low emittance light sources beam brightness is further increased when diffraction instruments are sourced by insertion devices such as multipole wigglers or undulators offering the opportunity for making further significant advances in both the quality and nature of the obtainable data the materials science beamline sa ref at the swiss light source sls and the high resolution powder diffraction beamline id ref at the european synchrotron radiation facility esrf for example provide ray beams of brightness photon mrad bw and incident flux at the sample that is two to three orders of magnitude higher than conventional bending magnets high brightness is important for low bandpass detection and to achieve the highest angular and hence space resolution it has become increasingly evident that the use of single crystals with narrow rocking curves mdeg or rad at kev is necessary to analyze the diffracted signal replacing the traditional slits or parallel foils arrangements of earlier instruments as well as improving the collimation resolution of the diffracted beam impinging on the detector allowing previously overlapped peaks to be resolved the inherent low energy bandpass e of the analyzing crystal improves signal to noise ratios by dramatically reducing background contributions this is of particular benefit to experiments involving strong sample fluorescence and compton scattering the main disadvantages however have been the hitherto long experimental times required to scan large angular ranges in using small steps mdeg and the long detector accumulation times required to compensate for the large reduction in the intensity of the analyzed signal reaching the detector this last factor alone restricted their widespread application on earlier generations of synchrotron powder diffractometers however solutions have been developed that employ multiple crystals located systematically in the scattering plane these follow two basic design concepts multiaxis instruments with one crystal mounted on each axial assembly distributed around the circle and ii single axis instruments consisting of multianalyzing crystal mac assembly with fixed prealigned angular offset between each crystal beamlines id esrf and sa sls for example have successfully deployed mac systems of nine and five crystals respectively based on the design of hodeau et al while the new bm beamline at the advanced photon source has recently commissioned twelve analyzer detector system in designing and constructing new undulator sourced powder diffraction beamline for diamond the uk new third generation synchrotron light source we have however adopted hybrid approach this combines the intensity recovery characteristics of the mac concept with the short angular scan range of the multiple axis approach to produce new powder instrument that provides high peak to background ratios and high resolution ray diffraction data with short data collection times and high sample throughput the technical design was peer reviewed in july and the beamline is now entering user operations the key features and specifications of the beamline design prior to construction are summarized in tang et al we present here the results of performance benchmarking for the high resolution measurement mode of the new powder instrument along with details of the ray beam and beamline performance characteristics ray source and the layout and approximate distances from the ray source of the various beamline components is shown in fig the source itself is an in vacuum undulator ivu insertion device located in the main electron storage ring the device has an array of permanent magnets sm co with period length of mm designed to produce rays ranging from to kev the theoretical tuning curve of flux density for the device is shown in fig and was specified as day deliverable the magnetic lattice is also designed to produce an intense ray beam in the low energy region kev using reduced gap mm fig inset the relative flux densities as function of tuned energy at the sample position are shown in fig the measurements are based on standard si and lab powder peak intensities to represent materials with respectively low and high absorption highest flux is obtained at medium energies kev decaying quickly beyond kev the beams produced by these devices in third generation synchrotron such as diamond have low divergence of rad vertical and rad horizontally which should result in small final beam size at the sample position using the primary slits to trim the beam edges fig shows images of the beam taken from fluorescence screen placed in the beam after slits fig and measured beam profiles obtained by scanning the slits with small vertical and horizontal apertures these dimensions match the typical size range for powder samples capillary or flat plate which for routine measurements removes the need for further complicated focusing optics and alignment procedures to reduce potential contamination of the ray beam by gas bremsstrahlung radiation from collisions occurring within the main electron ring the undulator is canted by mrad with small bending magnets located either end being used to steer the electron beam in and out of the device the optics hutch is approximately high long and wide with walls constructed from steel and lead panels the main components are water cooled primary slits which trim the white beam from the undulator ii double crystal monochromator dcm comprising two liquid nitrogen cooled si crystals iii double bounce harmonic rejection mirrors hrm iv two sets of monochromatic slits and an embedded intensity monitor io comprising thin kapton scattering foil and scintillation counter located after slits to alleviate the heat load on the dcm crystals closed circuit liquid nitrogen cooling system incorporating cryocooler reservoir is used to maintain the crystals at constant temperature the measured full width at half maximum fwhm of at kev obtained by rocking the top crystal appears close to the theoretical value although this is not true rocking curve measurement it does nevertheless indicate the effectiveness of the cryogenic cooling system changes in energy of the monochromatic beam are effected by changing the undulator gap and rotating the dcm crystals fixed exit height beam geometry across all energies is maintained by adjusting the separation distance of the two crystals to ensure the purity of the monochromatic beam the hrm assembly is located downstream of the dcm and to maintain the fixed exit height geometry this is also double bounce device the mirrors reduce contamination of the monochromatic beam by higher energy g photons which could otherwise be problematic for low energy experiments although the same effect can be achieved by misaligning the second dcm crystal fine tuning the dcm in this way is more likely to introduce beam instability and is more difficult to manage or automate in terms of beamline user friendliness the hrm assembly consists of pair of parallel si mirrors mm each having three stripe surface width mm along their length the stripes are one of bare polished si and one each of high purity rh and pt deposited coatings the operational angle is fixed at mrad and to provide adequate rejection over the beamline specified energy range the assembly is translated across the beam such that si surface is used for energies below kev ii rh coating for energies between and kev and iii pt coating for energies above kev diffractometer the experimental hutch again constructed from steel and lead panels is located downstream of the optics hutch and is approximately in length and wide at either end and in height the center piece is large heavy duty diffractometer dif with three coaxial high precision rotary stages and circle as shown in fig top this was designed and custom built by newport france to our specifications each of the circles has renishaw pitch encoders with resolution from laser auto collimation measurements the parallelism between each of the circles is rad equating to m axial uncertainty while the circle of confusion for the motion of each of the and axes is and respectively together these measurements define orthogonal spheroidal diameters and equate to an overall sphere error of the measured cylinder of confusion for the relative motion of the and circles is and for the and circles is the three circles are mounted on large granite base with motorized xyz movement for accurate positioning of the instrument center of rotation in the ray beam to facilitate the routing of services to sample cells etc the circle has mm diameter aperture open at each end that runs through the center of the diffractometer the mounting of sample stages is then via precision machined face plate that bolts directly onto the end of the circle located via machined recess for ambient measurements capillary or flat plate sample spinner mounted at the center of circle face plate is used to accept prealigned specimens attached to magnetic holders an industrial robotic arm rob and sample carousel car have also been installed for the automated pick and place of samples in high throughput experiments fig top noncontact sample environments cryostream and hot gas blower mounted on the large motorized sample table xyz can also be used in this mode alternatively samples in capillary flat plate holder or nonambient environment sample cell can be attached to small motorized xyz table that mounts on the circle in place of the prealigned spinner larger more bulky nonambient apparatus cryogenic devices and furnaces for measurements in the range of and variety of sample mounting and aligning stages are also available an embedded intensity monitor ie of the sample type as io in the optics hutch is located after slits to allow data to be normalized to changes in the monochromatic beam for high resolution measurements the large circle provides the scanning of positive angles above the beam via the use of five mac stages while time resolved per pattern measurements are provided for by wide angle position sensitive detector psd mounted on the circle using multiple mythen modules as its detection elements the psd has been designed to have aperture and an intrinsic angular resolution of or better however since the psd was not defined as day deliverable commissioning of this device is still ongoing and the performance characteristics of this device will be reported separately mac and perfect si or ge crystals have long been recognized as suitable analyzers for synchrotron powder beamlines the narrowness of their rocking curves means that the final instrumental resolution is governed almost entirely by the vertical divergence of the ray beam although ge crystals are sometimes preferred over si due to their higher intensity throughput e integrated reflectivity si crystals better meet the diffraction resolution requirement since at any given energy the si rocking curve is two to three times narrower than ge crystal of the same crystallographic orientation the sacrifice in intensity is more than compensated for by the high photon flux incident at the sample from the beamline undulator source the design of the mac system is based on the hodeau et al concept however to speed up data collection five identical nine crystal mac arms deploying total of crystals and detectors table are mounted on the circle at intervals fig bottom the mac configuration is essentially two circle concentric rotary stage with nine analyzing crystals mounted on the circle such that they are stacked with designed angular offset relative to the position of the mac arms of and while nine corresponding detectors are mounted systematically on the circle such that they are in the bragg condition for the si reflections from each of the nine crystals changes in energy of the incident ray beam are accommodated by coupled and rotations to maintain this condition the detectors themselves were specifically designed and developed for this instrument and their performance characteristics have been reported elsewhere for fixed operational energy powder patterns are thus measured simultaneously by each crystal detector combination as is scanned to obtain whole pattern coverage g the diffractometer needs only to scan the angular range between arms plus few degrees extra to provide sufficient overlap such that all angles are sampled by at least nine crystals the recorded patterns are converted in to series of sequentially overlapping patterns in by correcting the single measured corresponding to the middle crystal on the first arm by the respective angular offsets of the arms and crystals the patterns can then be merged into single pattern in this way the data statistics are increased over those of conventional single crystal detector pair scanned through the whole range while data collection times are improved by reducing both the scanned angular range and the integration time required for each individual detector key feature of the mechanical design of the mac stages that ensures their successful operation is that both the slots for the crystals on the mounting plate and the individual crystal holders were specified to tight machining tolerances this removes the need to provide any mechanism for individually aligning each crystal hub is placed over the crystals for protection and sealed against the mounting plate as shown in fig bottom there are baffles before and after the crystals the front baffle is designed to hold set of vertical foils to reduce axial divergence while the back baffle contains coarse equatorial plates between adjacent crystal channels to avoid cross talk between beams from different channels for the present work axial divergence foils were not used in order to maximize intensity throughput both the baffles and crystal hub have thin kapton windows for the entrance and exit of the diffracted and analyzed beams to reduce the air scatter path length all three are designed to operate under vacuum via rotary pump or be filled with light gas g he the detectors mount in precision machined slots in plates located on the circles with each plate also having linear translator to change the crystal to detector distance this compensates for the movement of the diffracted beam along the crystal surface as the operational energy is changed maintaining the analyzed beam at the detector center the optimal positions for the crystals and detectors on their respective mounting plates were determined by ray tracing for well ordered specimens the narrow rocking width of the analyzer crystals coupled to the low divergence of the undulator source means that intervals of to mdeg are required to adequately resolve diffraction peaks data collection based on the step scanning of whole patterns even if sub second counting times are used will take many hours due to the move stop settle count nature of the diffractometer motion in common with other beamlines deploying mac devices constant velocity trajectory cvt scan mode is therefore employed on in this mode the time required for the total scan is specified by the user and motion trajectory including ramp up and ramp down is calculated such that the diffractometer circle moves at constant angular speed through the range of interest during the scan the detectors are gated at sufficient frequency to give nominal interval of and values recorded from the circle encoders the diffractometer is controlled by newport xps controller which communicates with the beamline data acquisition system via an epics ref interface open source software http www aps anl gov epics index php calculation of the trajectory is done at the epics level and passed to the xps for asynchronous execution each trajectory contains elements and the range of movement is calculated such that velocity ramp up and ramp down lie outside the desired collection range during scan encoder positions and detector counts are stored in accumulating memory and on completion the encoder positions mac detector and two monitor signals per point are written to an ascii file postscan software then merges the individual patterns into single diffraction pattern since multiple diffraction patterns are recorded simultaneously against single recorded rotation in the first stage in merging the data is to adjust the measured by the arm and crystal offset for each crystal each intensity pair from each of the adjusted patterns are then binned into single array covering the entire range g with fixed interval of however slight irregularities in the circle motion due to deviations from the theoretical trajectory and small irregular delay times in the control electronics triggering the encoder read mean that each recorded value has small random offset this combined with the constant motion of the circle means that any given interval in the adjusted patterns will have integration times smaller or larger than the nominal interval and a range in that may straddle more than one bin the measured intensities in these instances are divided proportionately between bins first diffraction figure shows the peaks of srm silicon from national institute of standards and technology usa at kev measured from the nine analyzing crystals in the first arm mac the axis of each peak was adjusted to the center crystal reference by adding where is the small angular deviation per crystal from its designed value due to crystal miss cut and possible mounting strain these real offsets were determined from peak positions for each crystal obtained by fitting the measured peaks the distribution of the deviations is well within as expected from our control measures figure inset shows the peak extracted from the processed powder pattern the merging of the nine signals has produced strong peak without the need for corresponding increase in detector counting time while the narrow angular collimation of the analyzing crystals results in narrow peak width e high resolution the fwhm is greater than the intrinsic si rocking curve at this energy and arises from sample broadening contributions particle size and strain since no vertical collimation foils were used the peak shape is asymmetric with an extended low angle tail due to the effect of axial divergence to demonstrate the resolving power of the instrument fig shows diffraction scans of the quartz peaks srm these normally overlapping peaks appear well separated in the crystal offsets for the other four mac arms were determined using higher order reflections the distribution of data is again well within for the majority of the crystals as shown in fig and the overall spread is within the trend in the angular offsets is reproducible and independent of energy as the arm positions may also deviate slightly from their design values of and they too need to be measured these were determined using profile refinements on data summed only over the range covered by each arm with the axis shifted by the corresponding design values refinement of the zero points enabled us to determine the small arm offsets given the measured crystal and arm offsets data from all of the mac arms can be merged to produce single powder pattern figure is an example of processed pattern obtained from the silicon sample using h cvt scan at kev good fits to the peak shapes were achieved using the pseudo voigt pv analytical function in topas software refinement factors of rexp and rwp were obtained including the high angle data up to indicating the overall good fit to the data note that the pattern is free from spurious peaks from high harmonic contaminations and shielding leaks the mechanical stability of the mac arms was tested using static and ii scanning mode again diffraction peaks from srm silicon powder were used kev in static mode the diffractometer and mac arms were driven to si powder peak position and repeated measurements of the peak intensity made figure shows the peak intensity of the si reflection measured by the central crystal detector mac on mac arm the intensity of the incident beam was recorded using the embedded monitor ie with s integration time for top trace and simultaneously the peak intensity was measured bottom trace both sets of data display the frequency of the top up injection of the electron beam ma once the peak data were normalized to the monitor intensities fig of the data points were within and within where is the mean count as expected from distribution conforming to poisson statistics the measurement was repeated on the other mac arms and the same stable data observed g the peak measured on mac arm shown in fig confirming the static mechanical stability in scanning mode we selected powder peaks to be measured by the center crystals on each of the five arms for mac for mac for mac for mac and for mac the powder peaks were repeatedly scanned at hourly intervals up to and the peak positions obtained from fitting the data with pv function are shown in figs e the small spread of data on each arm lower angle macs mdeg and higher angle macs mdeg clearly demonstrates the good scanning mechanical stability the slow apparent drift with time of the peak positions to lower values is due to small shift in the wavelength of the incident beam caused either by thermal drift of the monochromator or small amount of movement in the electron beam approximately few micrometers in user experiment powder pattern collection times are typically min the peak positions were therefore measured with quick successive scans and the results for mac and mac arms for example are shown in fig again only small spread in the data was observed the static and scanning mode results confirm the stability of both the mechanical mac design and of the entire instrument during installation the hrm assembly was precisely surveyed into position once the mirrors were driven to intercept the monochromatic beam the first mirror was used to steer it into the experimental hutch and to the center of the diffractometer the effectiveness of the harmonic rejection was illustrated by measuring the si peak using the center crystal detector of mac arm with kev beam fig without the mirror system the peak shown in corresponds to and when the crystal detector was tuned to kev with the hrm assembly in the beam the measurements were repeated and the peak was observed as before while the harmonic peak was absent note that the asymmetric peak shape in is due to axial divergence although the hrm system is designed to cover the operational energy range kev we found that it was only necessary at low energies kev due to the rapid decay of the spectral emission from the undulator irf and detection the instrumental resolution function irf or the detection width as function of can be determined from the powder pattern of high quality sample the diffraction pattern shown in fig was measured for lab srm at kev with peaks up to without hrm assembly the data were fitted using the fundamental parameter method fpm ref in topas and mechanical details were obtained lorentzian and gaussian crystallite sizes and strain gaussian of fitting the peaks with pv function allowed the fwhm or as function of to be determined as representation of the instrumental function as plotted in fig main plot to good approximation the irf for powder instrument using analyzing crystals can be calculated from the equation below m m a where tan tan and tan tan with and are the bragg angles for the dcm and analyzer crystal is the vertical divergence of the incident beam and the contribution from the darwin widths of the monochromator and analyzing crystals are and respectively at this energy with the angular settings a eq reduces to m a applying the above equation the resolution function was calculated using the measured beam divergence rad and the theoretical width of rad for and the results are also plotted in fig for comparison however there are noticeable discrepancies between the experimental and calculated data particularly at low angles the additional broadenings are likely to be from the effects of particle size and or strain as indicated by the fitted results from fig in addition the williamson hall plot lorentzian components of the pv fwhm where l cos and sin clearly shows the particle size contribution fig inset top left the intercept gives an average value of which is in good agreement with the certified domain size of further measurements were performed using capillary specimen of na ca al nac which is known to produce narrower powder peaks than lab fig inset bottom right the nac data at lower angles is much closer to the calculated curve indicating that the lab discrepancies are due to the sample rather than instrumental in origin note that broadening due to axial divergence is not included in the fwhm data when compared with the lanthanide compound the nac specimen appears to have larger particles with an average size of lorentzian and is essentially strain free according to our best fpm refinement the particle size for nac is consistent with the result previously obtained for this material by masson et al the detection limit of the mac system was tested with powder mixture of wt tio srm and wt si srm and fig presents the powder pattern from long data collection time including the fitted data from rietveld refinement although the silicon signals are dwarfed by the oxide the good instrumental contrast enabled the detection of weak si peaks as shown in the expanded plot for the si reflection fig inset as the statistical errors are less than the plotted data this exercise demonstrates that few hours of data collection would be adequate for the detection of trace material in mixture down to one part per thousand we have designed and constructed new powder diffraction facility beamline at the diamond light source uk high brightness radiation is generated by an ivu and low bandpass ray beam is produced by double bounce si monochromator and harmonic rejection mirrors monochromatic beam is delivered to the center of the high precision diffractometer located in the experimental hutch high resolution powder diffraction is

dynamic range detection level have been presented this new facility is now operational and is routinely accepting users from wide range of research disciplines  x ray diffraction contrast tomography dct is technique for mapping grain shape and orientation in plastically undeformed polycrystals in this paper we describe modified dct data acquisition strategy which permits the incorporation of an innovative friedel pair method for analyzing diffraction data diffraction spots are acquired during rotation of the sample and are analyzed in terms of the friedel pairs hkl and hkl reflections observed apart in rotation the resulting increase in the accuracy with which the diffraction vectors are determined allows the use of improved algorithms for grain indexing assigning diffraction spots to the grains from which they arise and reconstruction the accuracy of the resulting grain maps is quantified with reference to synchrotron microtomography data for specimen made from beta titanium system in which second phase can be precipitated at grain boundaries thereby revealing the grain shapes the simple changes introduced to the dct methodology are equally applicable to other variants of grain mapping in polycrystalline materials the orientation shape and size of individual grains or clusters of grains can have important implications for range of aspects of the material behavior in many cases material behavior at these length scales is poorly understood and there is need for experimental techniques that allow its study ray diffraction contrast tomography dct is technique for the mapping of grain shape and crystal orientation in polycrystalline materials in nondestructive way it can be regarded as variant of the techniques generally known as three dimensional ray microscopy dxrd the basic concepts of dct have been presented in two previous papers with examples of the grain maps produced in this paper the authors present number of refinements to the experimental methodology and data analysis techniques previously described and show results illustrating the improvements obtained the scan range is extended to and the data analyzed in terms of friedel pairs of diffraction spots improving accuracy and enabling the use of improved indexing routines in contrast with previously introduced variants of dct which required the visibility of extinction contrast in the transmitted beam the indexing and reconstruction procedures presented in the current paper are based on the analysis of diffracted beams only as previously the attenuation of the simultaneously acquired transmitted beam can be used for reconstruction of the attenuation coefficient distribution in the sample e absorption contrast microtomography quantitative assessment of the grain mapping algorithms was carried out using synchrotron microtomography in metastable beta titanium alloy in which second phase was precipitated on the grain boundaries thereby revealing the grain shape in the tomographic reconstruction previous validations of dct have been limited to two dimensional postmortem sections made using electron backscatter diffraction the principles of dct and two analysis strategies using the information carried by the direct beam have been described recently the method presented in the current paper introduces the concept of friedel pair analysis of diffracted beams and combines the advantages of dct truly acquisition single acquisition distance simultaneously recorded absorption image and x ray diffraction dxrd lesser degree of diffraction spot overlap and better signal to noise for diffracted beams the experimental apparatus and acquisition procedure are similar to those used for standard synchrotron microtomography fig parallel monochromatic beam of synchrotron radiation illuminates the sample forming an absorption contrast radiograph in the center of the detector which is placed closely behind the sample the sample is continuously rotated through around an axis perpendicular to the incident beam and series of radiographs are recorded integrating over small angular increments typically in previous versions of the technique the sample was rotated through only during this rotation grains pass through alignments in which they fulfill the bragg criteria for diffraction when this takes place intensity is diverted out of the transmitted radiation beam into diffraction spot this diffraction spot is recorded on the outer part of the detector and the absorption and extinction information carried by the transmitted beam is recorded in the central part in general diffraction spots may spread over several consecutive images and need to be summed and segmented from the background information describing the spots size location etc are stored in database in the absence of significant orientation and strain gradients inside the grain each diffraction spot can with suitable processing be treated as parallel projection of the grain from which it arises data analysis friedel pairs are the key to both the efficiency and the accuracy of the novel data processing route presented here during the rotation of the sample the angle between given crystal plane of grain and the incident beam varies sinusoidally between zero and some maximum value in full rotation this angle coincides with the bragg angle maximum of four times provided the angle between the rotation axis and the plane normal is bigger than the bragg angle thus each set of lattice planes can give rise to maximum of four diffraction spots which make up two pairs each separated by rotation of the sample such pairs are called friedel pairs and they are the bragg reflections from the hkl and hkl lattice planes of the grain relative to the sample the pair of scattering vectors and the associated diffracted beams are parallel but have the opposite sign to understand the advantage of the friedel pair geometry it is useful to consider reference system in which the sample is fixed and the synchrotron beam and detector rotate relative to the sample fig it can be seen that the two diffracted beams forming the diffraction spots of the friedel pair are parallel and coincident sharing common point of origin in the diffracting grain thus the two spot positions define the path of diffracted beam and it is possible to calculate the diffraction angles associated with the scattering event without reference to the position of the grain in the sample furthermore it is clear that the grain must lie on the diffracted beam path the scattering vector diffracting plane normal and the hkl lattice plane type for the diffraction event can be found from the diffraction angles all of this information together with shape size and other properties of the diffraction spots can be used to improve the indexing process in which diffraction spots are sorted according to the grain from which they arise by using the centers of mass of the two spots the diffraction angles can be calculated with high accuracy in the absence of orientation and strain gradients the paired diffraction spots are mirror images of each other and therefore contain identical shape information an additional benefit is that in calculating the diffraction angle using two diffraction spots the distance between the spots along the direct beam is effectively twice the sample detector distance thereby improving the angular resolution by optimizing the experimental conditions it is possible to achieve sufficient accuracy in the determination of the diffraction angles to measure elastic lattice strains on grain by grain basis in an in situ loaded sample the details of this measurement and the analysis techniques used are described elsewhere errors in the determination of each scattering vector can be estimated as the difference between the vectors calculated from the two friedel pairs provided that both have been detected considering them as independent observations is reasonable since after correction for systematic errors detector distortions sample drifts etc the most significant error in the scattering vectors originates from the random error in determining the center of mass of the diffraction spots to exploit the available information it is necessary to identify the diffraction spot pairs in images separated by rotation as in the previous procedure after initial image processing operations diffraction spots are segmented from the images and data describing their shape size position etc are stored in database if the lattice type and lattice parameters of the sample and the energy of the radiation used are known it is possible to calculate the allowed diffraction angles hkl using the same fixed sample coordinate system described above the diffraction cones with hkl opening angles corresponding to these angles can be drawn based on the first diffraction spot these cones intersect the offset detector as circles and the second diffraction spot of the pair must lie on one of these fig it is also known that the grain must lie in the volume of the sample illuminated by the direct beam this imposes the further constraint that the second diffraction spot must lie within the region formed by projecting this volume from the position of the first spot on to the detector the size shape and intensity of the paired spots should also be similar by using these criteria with suitably selected tolerances pairs of spots can be found easily and reliably it is not possible to find the pairs of all diffraction spots because in some cases one of the pair will fall outside the detector area or may overlap with another diffraction spot or the direct beam as will be explained later it is not necessary that all spots be paired as single diffraction spots can be dealt with later the number of spot pairs found in data set comprising of grains with cubic symmetry is typically in the order of if the sample crystallography is not known it is still possible to identify pairs of spots that are well matched using the other criteria in simple cases this diffraction data could be used to determine the crystallography of an unknown material robust indexing procedure indexter has been developed to exploit the information available from the diffraction spot pairs this uses all spatial and crystallographic criteria simultaneously to form consistent sets in reliable and computationally efficient manner of diffraction spot pairs belonging to the same grain the algorithm consists of an iteration over three main processes which are executed sequentially this is shown schematically in fig build grains the base of the algorithm finds noncomplete groups of friedel pairs that originate from the same grains first an arbitrary friedel pair is chosen and all the others are checked for consistency with it by considering the spot properties areas sizes etc the crystallographic consistency of the angles between the diffracting plane normals and the distances between the diffracted beams in the sample coordinate system second systematic search is carried out among those pairs that passed the first selection if mutually consistent subset is found containing minimum number of pairs typically this parameters is chosen to be in the range of it is stored as grain those pairs from the first selection that do not disrupt this consistency are added to the grain if no grain is found the initially selected friedel pair is output as single pair not assigned to grain finally other grains are sought by the repetition of this procedure excluding singles and those pairs that have already been associated with grain merge grains if there are grain sets that represent two overlapping volumes with the same orientation they actually belong to the same grain and will be merged together once new grain is created by merging statistics of positional and angular accuracy are calculated and the tolerances used in the extend grains procedure for that grain are updated accordingly extend grains pairs that were left unassigned by build grains but that are found to be consistent with one of the merged grains are incorporated the loop is repeated several times with decreasingly strict tolerances until tolerance limits fixed by the operator are reached this gives robust indexing by minimizing the chance of wrong assignments in the first loops while ensuring that most of the pairs are indexed by the last iterations after the final iteration detailed statistics of the variations in diffraction spot properties and discrepancies in the fit of the diffraction data to the orientation and location of each grain are collected and stored for later analysis if required based on the relatively high number of pairs per grain outliers can be rejected on purely statistical basis by determining whether they fit in the observed distributions similarly measure of the goodness of fit of all remaining unassigned pairs to every existing grain set can be determined these pairs are added to the grain set they fit the best provided the goodness of fit is satisfactory once the grain positions and orientations have been identified the locations of all other diffraction spots belonging to each grain can be predicted and hence other unpaired diffraction spots added to the sets as previously the orientation of each grain is inferred from the point in the fundamental zone of rodriguez space where all projection lines for pole figure inversion of the corresponding grain cross each of the observed scattering vectors defines one of these projection lines in rodriguez space after indexing the shape and position reconstruction is performed independently for each grain by means of algebraic reconstruction techniques arts or any other suitable algorithm for tomographic data with limited numbers of projections for this the summed diffraction spots are normalized and treated as parallel projections of the grain using the diffraction spots has several advantages over the extinction spots previously used they are much less affected by spot overlap as they are spread over larger area of the detector because diffraction spots are recorded as bright spot on dark background whereas the extinction spots are recorded as missing intensity in the direct beam the diffraction spots have better contrast and are less affected by noise the improved accuracy of the diffraction vectors calculated from the friedel pairs allows the use of oblique angle art reconstruction alternatively grain reconstruction can also be performed using more widely available parallel beam art reconstruction algorithm by placing the diffraction spot projections at the position where the corresponding extinction spot would be observed the shape of the projection is corrected by allowing for the true omega angle of the projection and the shear distortion resulting from the non normal angle of incidence of the diffracted beams on the detector by placing the individual grain reconstructions at their correct positions within the sample volume the final grain map is assembled postprocessing operations are used to resolve cases where voxel is not assigned to grain or is assigned to more than one grain if these ambiguous voxels are left unlabelled one obtains grain map that is not completely space filling an approximation of the real space filling grain map can be obtained from this initial map by d morphological dilation process of the grains into the unlabeled voxels until all the unclaimed or disputed voxels have been assigned grain labels are not allowed to grow into other grains or grow beyond the sample volume as found from the absorption reconstruction the data analysis procedure outlined in the previous paragraphs has been implemented using the matlab programming environment most of the sequential processing steps can be performed in parallel on subset of the data the use of central database for storage of the metadata and parallel processing of computing jobs on cluster of machines helps reduce the processing time which roughly scales with the number of grains or diffraction spots using computing cluster of nodes data set comprising of grains can currently be analyzed in one day this time could further be reduced by optimization of the code and the possible use of hardware accelerators for computational intense tasks to validate the grain maps produced by the data collection and processing route described in sec ii dct data set was acquired from specimen in which it was possible to decorate the grain boundaries by precipitation of second phase and thereby image the grain shapes directly using propagation based phase contrast tomography pct since precipitation may entail an increase of the local effective misorientation inside grains the acquisition of the dct scan was performed in the initial state before heat treatment the reconstruction of the dct grain map was performed without input from the pct data set the extraction of the grain boundary network from the pct data set was performed using the dct map as seed map for the watershed segmentation process the metastable titanium bcc alloy timet ti mo nb al wt was selected as suitable material it provides the possibility of directly imaging the grain shapes in pct through the precipitation of second phase on the grain boundaries it is possible to produce microstructures consisting of large equiaxed beta grains bcc with low mosaicity e low subgrain misorientation and its density and atomic numbers are low enough to give only limited absorption at the acquisition energy thus forming diffraction spots that appear clear and undistorted before the dct acquisition the mm diameter sample was annealed in vacuum for at the heat treatment allowed recovery of any residual stresses or plastic deformation introduced during sample manufacture and increased the average beta grain size to this was calculated subsequently from the complete grains in the dct grain map the dct data acquisition was performed at beamline id of the esrf using frelon charge coupled device camera with transparent luminescent screen and optics giving an effective pixel size of the ray energy was kev and images were recorded during rotation of the sample with distance between sample and detector of mm the overall scan acquisition time using si double crystal monochromator in bragg bragg reflection was more recently the overall acquisition time could be reduced to less than using monochromator with relative bandwidth of the grain map was reconstructed using the data processing route described in this paper d rendered view of the resulting map is shown in fig second heat treatment of at was used to produce thin film of grain boundary hcp precipitates the alpha phase is enriched with al while the beta phase is enriched in mo and nb as verified by energy dispersive ray spectroscopy this leads to detectable difference in electron density in pct tomographic reconstruction of the heat treated sample was produced from data acquired at beamline id esrf images were acquired at pixel size of using an energy of kev and sample to detector distance of mm fig image processing the pct data set showing the grain boundary precipitation can be used as reference against which to assess the accuracy of grain shapes in the dct grain map however it does not produce perfect grain boundary map because during the second heat treatment small fraction of grain boundaries are not decorated with the precipitated phase and certain amount of undesirable intragranular precipitation occurs these features must be corrected before it is possible to extract the complete boundary network required for automated quantitative comparisons the following processing route incorporating some prior knowledge from the dct map has been developed to determine an accurate grain map from the pct data all measurements and image processing steps were done using matlab and the image processing toolbox dipimage prior to processing the dct volume was scaled oversampling by factor of to give the same effective voxel size of the pct volume and the two data sets aligned initial segmentation the pct data was denoised using median filter and its contrast enhanced using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization region growth algorithm was performed to segment the grain boundaries as regions of interest rois after morphological closing of the roi very small isolated regions mostly intragranular precipitates were excluded by applying size filter intragranular precipitates still erroneously assigned to the roi were excluded manually decorated grain boundaries not yet belonging to the roi were included manually restoration of boundaries the resulting network of boundaries still contained some gaps due to the presence of nondecorated boundaries as illustrated in fig those gaps were filled with the help of d watershed algorithm using the dct grain map as markers to avoid oversegmentation the network of grain boundaries from the pct data and the dct grain map had to be modified in order to serve as good ridgeline and marker map respectively the pct network of grain boundaries was reduced in thickness to give accurate final grain outlines the markers derived from the dct map after postprocessing should be as big as possible to attain good results but must not overlap with the network of grain boundaries due to the remaining inaccuracy of the dct map the latter condition is not fulfilled and optimization of the marker map was done by performing the watershed algorithm without markers on the slimmed network of grain boundaries from the pct data yielding closed but slightly incorrect network of grain boundaries due to oversegmentation this network was applied to the dct grain map thereby dividing dct grains that overlapped with the network of grain boundaries the marker map was created out of the biggest subvolume of each dct grain this marker map was used to obtain final grain boundary map note that it is the original ridgeline map that determines the boundary network shape and the marker map only determines how the nonvisible grain boundaries are restored therefore it is valid to the resultant boundary map to be used to assess the dct map the validation of the dct grain map by this method relies on the precision of the grain boundary network segmented from the pct errors in this segmentation will influence the result of this validation even when considering the errors from the acquisition and reconstruction of the pct volume to be negligible the errors due to image processing have to be discussed during the alignment and scaling of the volume some aliasing errors are introduced due to the voxel nature of the data but the effect of these errors should be small error sources of probably higher impact are the nondecorated grain boundaries which were not segmented due to the absence of precipitates and the grain boundaries close to the surface that were hardly visible because their contrast was superimposed by the strong phase contrast between sample and surrounding air these invisible boundaries are restored by the watershed algorithm and represent less than of the total boundary area therefore errors introduced by this method are not expected to have significant effect on the final results diffraction the accuracy with which diffraction data are observed can be assessed using the redundant measurements of the scattering vectors from which two friedel pairs are observed for the current data set the mean angular deviation between such pairs is the same measure can also be determined for the same data set processed using the previous methodology in this case maximum of four observations of each scattering vector is possible one for each diffraction spot and the mean angular deviation is found to be thus the introduction of the friedel pair analysis gives five times improvement the mean angular deviation in the bragg angle was estimated to be and in all grains visible in the pct data are also found in the dct map and the grain shapes and size appear to be very similar in all cases figure shows section through the dct grain map with the boundaries segmented from the pct data as an overlay the accuracy of the grain shapes determined by dct was quantified by comparing the pct and dct grain maps on grain by grain basis first d euclidean distance transform was applied on the grain outline of pct grain then this volume was multiplied with the outline of the same grain from the dct map the values of this intersection represent the closest distance between the two outlines or alternatively the error of dct the average error in the dct grain outlines was found to be voxels in the pct map corresponding to voxels in the dct grain map fig the simultaneous extended beam illumination of large number of grains requires some conditions in terms of deformation state texture and grain size of the material to be fulfilled to make it amenable for this type of characterization the presence of orientation gradients inside grain leads to the violation of the parallel projection approximation and may result in distortion and breakup of diffraction spots the inverse reconstruction procedure outlined in the present paper cannot correctly handle such cases for this reason dct works best for microstructures exhibiting only limited levels of intragranular orientation spread typically below despite the high angular resolution provided by the dct indexing approach it can for similar reasons to the ones mentioned in the previous paragraph be problematic to accurately reconstruct grains that are divided into subgrains by small angle grain boundaries with low misorientation values the indexing procedure presented has proven to be robust and applicable to sample volumes containing up to few thousands of grains the typical size of the illuminated area pixels on pixels detector and the requirement to have sufficient spatial sampling of the diffraction spots for shape reconstruction pixels result in some typical boundary conditions concerning maximum sample size and minimum grain size both expressed in terms of detector pixels consequently large range of physical sample and grain sizes can be investigated by appropriate choice of beam energy and pixel size of the detector system energies between and kev and resolutions between and and have been explored so far for different material systems by indexing grains directly from diffraction spot data the new methodology presented represents partial convergence between dct and dxrd ref from which it was originally derived however it retains some distinctive features namely that d box rather than d line focused beam is used to illuminate the sample and that the absorption images are acquired simultaneously with the diffraction spots allowing reconstruction of the absorption contrast microstructure of the sample this has significant benefits in speed of data collection and analysis by combined techniques the friedel pair analysis used to determine the diffracted beam paths is similar to the dxrd concept in which the detector is moved and the diffraction spot positions recorded at series of distances from the sample in that case the diffraction angles can then be calculated using the shift in spot position between the different detector distances in the friedel pair method the detector is not moved but effectively the diffraction spot is recorded at two distances the sample detector distance this is advantageous because single optimized sample detector distance can be used the effective distance between the two detector positions is usually larger and alignment problems resulting from nonreproducible movements of the detector are avoided the described methodology for rotation has significant advantages compared to the previously described dct methodology by allowing indexing directly from the diffraction spots without reference to the extinction spots the requirements of very low grain mosaicity and only limited extinction spot overlap are significantly relaxed however in those materials with suitable microstructures the extinction spots are still available and can still be used as additional grain projections the need for computationally intensive image correlation step to find the extinction spot corresponding to diffraction spot is no longer necessary once the grain center is known from the indexing step the diffraction data measured using friedel pairs are also significantly more accurate than can be determined in the case the methodology described maintains the use of small angular increments of sample rotation this was initially required to achieve maximum contrast in the extinction spots and to minimize extinction spot overlap however it also has other benefits for the diffraction spot based analysis by reducing the number of diffraction spots in each image diffraction spot overlaps are also reduced and the chance of erroneous matches when determining friedel pairs is reduced in addition the improved resolution of the diffraction event in omega sample rotation affects the precision with which the scattering vector can be determined this is an important consideration if elastic strain is to be determined comparison to acquisition by far field the accuracy of determination of the diffraction angles can be improved in all cases by using detector with larger pixel size located far from the sample in this case angular sensitivity is improved at the expense of spatial resolution sensitivity to grain position the described dct methodology has the advantage of combining good angular and spatial resolution for reliable indexing the concept of friedel pairs can of course be applied to far field diffraction data to achieve the best possible angular sensitivity polychromatic ray diffraction in combination with differential aperture ray microscopy is powerful tool for probing the grain structure in polycrystalline materials at the submicrometer length scale since the scanning procedure isolates the signal from small volume elements this method can be applied to plastically deformed specimen and provides access to local orientation and deviatoric components of the elastic strain tensor however the requirement to scan the sample in three dimensions implies some limitations in time resolution and sample volume that can be analyzed with this technique typically few tens to hundreds of micrometers dct on the other hand can cover length scales between couple of hundred micrometers up to several millimeters and works best for plastically undeformed grain microstructures in which each grain can be described by an average crystallographic orientation the illumination of sample volume containing thousands of grains enables fast measurement of statistically relevant number of grains and the possibility of direct combination with high resolution ray tomography makes this technique highly complementary to polychromatic microdiffraction the analysis of redundant pairs of diffraction spots indicates accuracy in the determination if the bragg angle is or rad this value suggests that it must be possible to measure average elastic strains from individual reflections with precision of order of cot from the derivation of bragg law this conservative estimate is based on bragg angle of and assumes that systematic errors arising from spatial distortion mechanical drifts of the instrument and uncertainties in the alignment can be determined and reduced to comparable levels further improvement in accuracy and access to the full strain tensor on grain by grain basis may be expected using fitting routine that combines the multiple measurements that are available for each grain as opposed to the inverse reconstruction approach presented in the current paper one may envisage reconstruction of grain maps by forward simulation approaches in this case one seeks by assigning orientations to voxels in sample space the configuration that minimizes the difference between experimentally observed and simulated diffraction patterns such algorithms can account for local variations in orientation inside grains and may overcome the current restriction to low levels of orientation spread some encouraging results have been obtained for line focus illumination of one sample cross section simulated data of deformed specimen and first maps for an undeformed specimen have been obtained from stacking of data it can be expected that the combination of dct with such minimization procedures will further improve the accuracy of grain maps provided by dct for the case of undeformed specimen the current postprocessing morphological dilation may be replaced by testing for each of the ambiguous voxels the goodness of fit between simulated and measured diffraction patterns when assigning the orientation of one of the neighboring grains one may consider two alternative acquisition procedures for accommodation of extended sheetlike sample geometries reduction of the omega scanning range to the symmetric interval and ii scanning with an inclined rotation axis equivalent to laminography acquisition geometry however in both cases some additional complications arise for instance one has to deal with larger number of spots possible overlaps and reduced quality of reconstruction limited angular interval in the first case and with the absence of friedel pairs in the second configuration in both cases an optimized design of the detector head is required in order to fulfill the proximity constraint distance between rotation axis and detector comparable to the detector field of view the dct methodology presented represents significant progress over previous versions by determining the diffraction data more accurately the indexing step of the processing is made more reliable and can be more readily automated than previously improved grain mapping and diffraction data and an extended range of materials to which it may be applied make dct more useful tool that may be applied to scientific problems the improved determination of diffraction angles using friedel pairs opens the possibility of achieving sensitivity to elastic strain at the level of individual grains the concept of using friedel pairs to determine diffraction data is equally applicable to other variants of polycrystal indexing and grain mapping  zno and tio are two of the most commonly used type metal oxide semiconductors in new generation solar cells due to their abundance low cost and stability zno and tio can be used as active layers photoanodes buffer layers transparent conducting oxides hole blocking layers and intermediate layers doping is essential to tailor the materials properties for each application the dopants used and their impact in solar cells are reviewed in addition the advantages disadvantages and commercial potential of the various fabrication methods of these oxides are presented photovoltaics hold great potential for addressing the world growing energy demand the earth receives tw of solar power whereas the global energy consumption is only tw yet photovoltaics contribute only of the world energy production due to the high cost of traditional silicon based solar cells to address this issue it is essential to develop efficient solar cells by using new earth abundant non toxic and stable materials and by implementing low cost scalable fabrication methods zno and tio are widely used type semiconducting materials in new generation solar cells because they are abundant have high stability are of simple composition and therefore amenable to low temperature low cost scalable processing methods these materials tend to be used complementarily in solar cells because they have similarly positioned conduction and valence bands approximately to ev below vacuum level for the conduction band and to ev for the valence band but they exhibit different properties that are advantageous for different applications for example zno tends to have higher conductivity than tio while tio tends to have higher chemical stability zno can be easily nanostructured whereas tio has much higher dielectric constant and fewer defect states which leads to less recombination the ability to tune the properties of each oxide in controlled manner in order to best suit the photovoltaic application and hence maximize the performance of the device is an important challenge doping of zno and tio offers an opportunity to achieve this in cost effective manner in this research update we focus on the recent developments on tuning the properties of these materials through doping and we showcase the most promising methods for fabricating high performance doped materials in commercially viable way the devices covered in this research update are inorganic solar cells hybrid solar cells bulk heterojunction bhj solar cells dye sensitized solar cells dsscs and quantum dot solar cells the operating principles of these devices have been well covered in the literature such as refs and doping of zno or tio can tune the built in potential vbi and electron driving force in inorganic hybrid and dye sensitized solar cells by adjusting the conduction band and fermi level positions one of the most common methods of tuning the zno conduction band is through mg doping this occurs because the mg orbitals hybridize and raise the energy level of the zn orbitals in the zno conduction band minimum leading to an increased bandgap recently zn xmgxo has been employed to increase the efficiency pce of zno cu solar cells as shown in figs and and table when the fermi level of the doped zno is increased through raised conduction band the increased band bending leads to an increased vbi resulting in an increased open circuit voltage voc on the other hand microstructure can be compromised by doping duan et al found that when the mg content of the metal organic chemical vapor deposited mocvd zn xmgxo was above the mocvd films were too rough for the type cu layer to be electrodeposited on top olson et al found similar film roughening when depositing zn xmgxo by sol gel but in their case the increased roughness was fortuitous because the spin coated polymer absorber they used poly hexylthiophene diyl or ht remained adherent to the zn xmgxo films and the increased roughness raised the current extracted for their hybrid devices fig by increasing the interfacial area doping can also be detrimental to carrier mobility and mg doping has been found to decrease the mobility of zno by increasing the effective electron mass owing to the change in the band structure this limits the amount of mg doping for improving device performance smoother zn xmgxo films have been deposited for solar cells using atomic layer deposition ald where root mean square roughness values of few nanometers were obtained but unlike sol gel deposition ald like mocvd is limited because of the need for vacuum processing which restricts the size of the substrates increases the total deposition time and increases the processing complexity and cost also organometallic precursors which are often expensive and pyrophoric are typically used in mocvd or ald sol gel is advantageous over these two techniques because it involves air processing using non pyrophoric precursors in addition to providing greater flexibility in producing films with new compositions due to the simplicity of the process as such wide variety of novel dopants have been introduced to zno or tio using sol gel deposition the disadvantage is that only one substrate can be processed at time if spin coating is used for depositing the film from the sol and the precursors and products often require ageing at temperatures of up to ald films are advantageous over sol gel and mocvd films which require processing because relatively low temperatures of only are required dsscs based on zno photoanodes have not been found to be as efficient as ones with tio partially due to recombination that arises as result of the instability of zno in contact with acidic dyes g the common dye and the formation of zn dye aggregates through the substitutional replacement of zn with mg both of these factors were alleviated additionally raising the conduction band increased the vbi by increasing the conduction band redox potential offset leading to an increased voc however when the mg content was too high the mg occupying interstitial sites was thought to create shallow acceptor levels above the fermi level leading to increased recombination hence doping led to improved stability increased voc and reduced charge recombination at low doping levels and high charge recombination at high doping levels mg content of mol represents the best compromise between these factors table doping tio with mg has also been found to raise the conduction band this was attributed to the formation of mg ti mixed oxides since mgtio and mgti have larger bandgaps than undoped tio the raised conduction band resulted in an increased vbi and voc for dsscs fig these were further increased by changing the commonly used i redox couple with br br which has lower redox couple potential along with surface treatment of the doped tio electrodes using mgo and ethanoic acid to reduce back electron transfer as result an extremely high voc of was obtained table reducing the bandgap of tio through doping has also been undertaken to improve the alignment of the tio with the conduction band of infrared absorbing pbs quantum dots qds as illustrated in fig liu et al found that the conduction band of sol gel deposited undoped tio was slightly above that of the qds fig and limited electron injection doping the tio with zr or sb lowered the tio conduction band figs and having the qd conduction band exactly aligned with the tio conduction band as in the case of the zr tio in fig was found to produce the most efficient devices because when the tio conduction band was too low as with sb tio the voc was reduced by lower quasi fermi level offset between the tio and qds lower vbi see figs and and possibly in addition to electron thermalization down the metal oxide conduction band tail optimizing the band alignment balancing voc and short circuit current density jsc through conduction band tuning is therefore essential for maximizing efficiency although using tio photoanodes has produced the most efficient dsscs the tio needs to be sensitized with dye because the tio bandgap is too wide to absorb visible light if this bandgap could be reduced the photocurrent generated could be increased doping of tio improves visible light absorption of dye sensitized tio fig by introducing new states close to the valence band as result additional photocurrent is generated in the devices while the voc is not sacrificed since the conduction band is not shifted table ii ball milling tio with thiourea is low temperature method for doping tio which also improves the visible light absorption and therefore the jsc when used in dsscs table ii however xps measurements showed that substitution of ti rather than substitution of occurred meaning that the conduction band was affected and the voc was reduced with doping sol gel cr doped tio has also been found to reduce the bandgap and enhance visible light absorption more remarkably incorporating at cr also made the tio type by inserting this type layer between type undoped tio and the dye fig back recombination was reduced and fill factors ffs increased injected electrons can tunnel through the n junction of solar cell via trap states at the interface and recombine with hole in the type material as illustrated in fig this lowers the efficiency of solar cells by reducing the voc and ff and can be prevented by inserting buffer layer at the interface fig unlike tio undoped zno tends to have too many defect states and carrier concentration that is too high to be buffer layer this can be controlled through doping vacuum sputtered mg doped zno has been used in sns solar cells and this increased the efficiency from to table iii because the built in potential at the interface increased with the zno fermi level resulting in stronger driving force to prevent recombination more effective zno buffer layers were produced by doping amorphous zno with tin zto this lowered the density of defect states raised the zno fermi level and reduced the carrier concentration from cm undoped down to below cm at sn all of these factors served to reduce back recombination in cu a zto al zno solar cells and increased the efficiency to record value of table iii ald was used to deposit the zto because thin nm film was needed to allow current to pass through the buffer layer however ald is vacuum based technique and more scalable alternative is atmospheric ald aald the key feature is gas manifold in which the metal precursor and oxidant are spatially separated by inert nitrogen gas channels which allows the films to be deposited in open atmosphere at rate of approximately one order of magnitude higher than conventional ald aald has been used to incorporate at into zno to reduce the zno carrier concentration and therefore to reduce interfacial recombination in pbs colloidal quantum solar cells cqdscs doping zno or tio to increase the carrier concentration can lead to transparent conducting oxides tcos based on zno and tio or layers to improve current extraction from solar cells typically these dopants substitute lattice ions cationic substituents must have higher valency than the host cation and anionic substituents must have lower valency than the host anion in order to introduce extra charge carriers this is illustrated by the substituent doping reactions shown in fig often shallow donor states are created by the introduction of these dopants which form an impurity band when the impurity band overlaps with the bottom of the conduction band and the fermi level rises to within the conduction band due to the increased carrier concentration the semiconductor becomes degenerate and conducts like metal thus giving rise to tcos transparent conducting oxides tcos are essential for admitting light and collecting charge in solar cells but the common tcos fluorine doped tin oxide or fto and indium doped tin oxide or ito are either limited in conductivity fto or are expensive ito al doped zno azo and ga doped zno gzo are both are more abundant than in less expensive and non toxic and more conductive than fto azo has been deposited by vacuum based methods such as pulsed laser deposition pld sputtering and ald low pressure chemical vapor deposition lp cvd has been used to deposit rougher azo films which scatters light to improve absorption in the solar cells e the films have higher haze factor leading to higher jscs in amorphous silicon solar cells table iv however azo has limited thermal stability and longevity due to the high reactivity of al ga doped zno is more stable conductive and transparent than azo in ht pcbm phenyl butyric acid methyl ester devices the efficiencies of devices with gzo as the tco were comparable to using ito table iv gzo is also less resistive and more transparent than fto but is susceptible to acid etching which limits the use of gzo in dsscs where the dye is acidic this was overcome by protecting the gzo with thin tio layer table iv nb doping is common method of producing tcos based on anatase tio both nb and ti are more abundant than in resistivities as low as cm with nb and visible light transmittance have been obtained but these results were achieved using high temperature processes such as pld and sputtering nb tio has been employed in lieu of pure tio as more conductive protective layer for zno based tcos in dsscs as seen in table iv azo coated with pld nb tio improved the efficiency of dsscs compared with using only azo as the tco attempts have been made to deposit nb tio in low temperature ambient conditions using sol gel deposition but it was found that the films were not highly conductive unless they were annealed at high temperatures it is therefore challenging to produce nb tio using an easily scalable ambient method doping of zno or tio to improve the conductivity can also be used to increase the photocurrent in solar cells by reducing the series resistance one application is blocking layers in bulk heterojunction solar cells bhjs bhjs are organic solar cells in which the electron donating and electron accepting polymers are intimately mixed together to maximize the interfacial area for charge separation since both phases are in contact with each electrode blocking layers are needed to prevent recombination at the electrodes this is illustrated in fig zno and tio are common hole blocking layer hbl materials because they have high electron mobilities but low hole mobilities and large ionization energies that inhibit hole transfer sol gel in doping of zno has been found to reduce the sheet resistance from to cm and increased the transparency to visible light resulting in an increased device efficiency due to an increased photocurrent table a similar result was obtained by lif doping of zno this is because li occupies the interstitial sites and dissociates to give li and the component occupies substitutional sites where it accepts one fewer electron than both of which lead to an increased carrier concentration table lif zno has been shown to have transmittance for visible light and is not as rare or toxic as in making lif doping advantageous over in doping nb zno nanoparticles synthesized using flame spray pyrolysis have also been used in novel way in bhjs they were incorporated into the ht pcbm blend to form an organic inorganic composite nb doping reduced the sizes of the nanoparticles which then scatter more light and leads to an increased light absorption in the blend thus maximizing the incident photon to current efficiency ipce and jsc furthermore the ht absorber pcbm and nb zno nanoparticles present cascade in upper energy levels lumo conduction band which aids electron transfer from the ht to pcbm to the nb zno since the nb zno has its conduction band approximately aligned with the al top contact fermi level the cascading energy levels improve charge extraction and increase the efficiency through an increased jsc table dsscs with zno photoanodes can have improved efficiency through more conductive photoanodes through doping via chemical bath deposition doping tio photoanodes with either or can also improve the conductivity leading to an increase in the efficiency through jsc increase dopants are reported to increase the carrier concentration of tio by favoring the formation of oxygen vacancies similar effect was also observed through zn doping the tio which is thought to improve the electron transport properties although the specific mechanisms involved in carrier generation have not been thoroughly studied excessive doping however was found to introduce surface oxygen vacancies which acted as recombination centers ta and nb have also successfully increased the conductivity of tio photoanodes in dsscs however it was found that the increase in carrier concentration led to an increase in the flat band potential this increases the driving force for electron injection contributing to the jsc increase but decreases the offset from the redox couple potential resulting in decrease in the voc the advantages of stability and conductivity offered by nb tio have also been used to improve the performance of hybrid solar cells with meh ppv as the absorbing type polymer as can be seen in table the improved conductivity almost tripled the jsc leading to the efficiency almost doubling the other doping methods to improve the conductivity of tio or zno could also be applied to obtain similar improvement in performance of hybrid solar cells in summary we have described how different dopants and the methods for including them in zno and tio have their advantages and disadvantages to optimize solar cell performance it is critical to fine tune the conductivity to balance the increased photocurrent with increased recombination or decreased voc from this research update it can be seen that for each case of zno and tio used in solar cells there are variety of dopants available to tailor the properties and optimize the device performance however some dopants stand out as being more effective in some applications certain dopants have been extremely widely used even though some disadvantages associated with those dopants have not yet been overcome one such example is mg doping of zno while it is possible to dope zno with mg over an extremely wide range for variety of applications doping reduces the mobilities other dopants that increase the bandgap while minimizing the reduction in mobility should be explored ga doped zno should be studied in the future more than al doped zno since gzo is more conductive transparent and stable than azo producing rougher tcos to increase the haze factor and light absorption should also be investigated however tcos based on zno are not suitable for dsscs due to the acidic nature of the typical dyes used this could be overcome by covering zno based tco with thin protective nb doped tio layer the challenge would be to deposit sufficiently conductive nb doped tio layer using scalable methods doping the tio photoanodes with s or cr should also be employed more to improve light absorption in dsscs co doping to simultaneously improve the conductivity is also possibility although this would be limited by the complexity of the deposition method and the possibility of unintended interactions between the co dopants which could for example lead to the formation of second phase throughout this research update we have highlighted new methods employed to dope zno and tio via scalable techniques as opposed to the traditional vacuum based methods pld sputtering cvd ald this is important since the fundamental driving force for new generation solar cell research is the production of photovoltaics that cost less than conventional silicon based solar cells using scalable low cost facile techniques is an essential component of this sol gel is one of the most commonly used open atmosphere techniques on the laboratory scale to synthesize variety of new doped metal oxides due to the versatile nature of this process but sol gel is limited for large scale production because it is batch process with limited throughput the precursor and product often require ageing and annealing and the films can be porous solvothermal hydrothermal electrodeposition and chemical bath deposition have similar limitations but have higher commercial potential films can be deposited by micro plasma oxidation over large areas at low cost but are limited by the high voltage required spray pyrolysis can also be used in continuous process although the precursors need to be heated to relatively high temperatures aald or spatial ald can be upscaled to continuous roll to roll process and has the distinct advantage of producing uniform conformal thin films over large areas in open atmosphere at relatively low temperatures of however aald is limited by the need to have highly reactive liquid precursors for the metal oxides these are typically expensive pyrophoric organometallic precursors nonetheless many of these precursors are the same as for conventional ald or cvd and can be obtained commercially finding ways to deposit doped zno or tio using aald spray pyrolysis or other solution based processes is very worthwhile for the ultimate goal of commercialization zno and tio are abundant stable materials that can be synthesized using variety of different techniques in new generation solar cells they have wide variety of applications but each application requires different properties and doping is cost effective way of tailoring the properties to optimize the device performance this includes conduction band alignment optimization increasing the visible light absorption for dssc photoanodes reducing interfacial recombination when used as buffer layers increasing conductivity and visible light transmittance when used as tco or to improve charge extraction from the absorber doping methods range from vacuum based to open air processing batch processing to continuous processing new dopants tend to be explored using vacuum based processing and or batch processing techniques such as pld sputtering and sol gel however even though doping is sometimes challenging using scalable techniques it is essential to replicate these doped zno tio materials using such approaches in order to fulfill the ultimate aim of commercializing new generation solar cells finally as has been evident in this research update there are often multiple dopants that can achieve the same property enhancements if one doping system is difficult to produce using scalable technique it is likely that another doping system could be successfully explored instead  focusing and sorting cells and particles utilizing microfluidic phenomena have been flourishing areas of development in recent years these processes are largely beneficial in biomedical applications and fundamental studies of cell biology as they provide cost effective and point of care miniaturized diagnostic devices and rare cell enrichment techniques due to inherent problems of isolation methods based on the biomarkers and antigens separation approaches exploiting physical characteristics of cells of interest such as size deformability and electric and magnetic properties have gained currency in many medical assays here we present an overview of the cell particle sorting techniques by harnessing intrinsic hydrodynamic effects in microchannels our emphasis is on the underlying fluid dynamical mechanisms causing cross stream migration of objects in shear and vortical flows we also highlight the advantages and drawbacks of each method in terms of throughput separation efficiency and cell viability finally we discuss the future research areas for extending the scope of hydrodynamic mechanisms and exploring new physical directions for microfluidic applications manipulation and sorting of cells and particles suspended in microfluidic platforms raise great interest in biomedical applications such as oncology stem cell research and genomic mapping isolating targeted cells from the surrounding environment g blood sample is tremendously beneficial in diagnostic and therapeutic operations in this regard capturing the least abundant cells plays vital role in diagnosis of some lethal diseases such as malaria cancer and hiv disease for example collecting the circulating tumor cells ctcs and fetal cells in peripheral blood is essential for early detection of cancer and parental diagnosis of chromosomal diseases moreover purified cell samples with enhanced concentration of cells of interest provide rich environment to study the biological and physical properties of those cells the non microfluidic techniques developed for cell separation such as membrane filtration centrifugation method fluorescence activated cell sorting facs and magnetic activated cell sorting macs cover wide range of applications however microfluidic based devices introduce several advantages including higher processing rates lower sample use enhanced spatial resolution and increased accessibility due to lower cost in addition contrary to the conventional cytometry techniques where their dependence on biochemical labels for cell identification limits their use in some applications these alternative methods are label free e trap cells and particles based on their intrinsic physical characteristics including size shape deformability density polarizability magnetic susceptibility and so on exploiting these properties the separation is achieved by applying the relevant force fields such as optical electric magnetic acoustic and hydrodynamic forces the controlling mechanism in the aforementioned handling techniques can be classified in two categories active methods based on the application of external force fields and passive methods where their functionality is established by harnessing microchannel geometrical effects and nonlinear hydrodynamic forces in the past decade extensive investigations have been conducted in order to trap and sort cells and particles using either innovative active techniques such as dielectrophoresis dep magnetophoresis acoustophoresis and optical tweezers or novel passive approaches including pinched flow fractionation pff hydrodynamic filtration biomimetic methods hydrophoretic focusing deterministic lateral displacement dld and surface acoustic wave saw induced streaming each of these methods is associated with some advantages and deficiencies which make them preferable in certain applications comprehensive review papers on the focusing and sorting techniques in microfluidics have been authored in recent years which describe the underlying mechanisms and corresponding performance of the aforementioned methods in the current review article we focus on the basic physics and applications of two families of label free passive methods utilized to handle and separate cells and particles by exploiting forces exerted on them due to hydrodynamic effects arising in microfluidic devices the first approach employs the well known phenomenon of cross stream migration of suspended particles in confined flows it has been shown that particles exposed to shear flow experience lift force perpendicular to the flow direction where its orientation and strength depend on several factors including channel geometry flow rate rheological properties of the carrier fluid and physical characteristic of the particle the second approach utilizes the vortical flow induced by acoustic streaming to trap and sort cells particles within the vortices in this scheme eddies generated by the oscillation of solid or soft boundaries perturb the flow creating separatrices which segregate particles based on their size and deformability in the following sections the physical mechanisms of these methods have been generally described and survey of the studies employing these techniques has been presented hydrodynamics in this section we address the underlying physics of the lateral migration of the cells and particles engendered by variety of hydrodynamic forces and then we describe the pertinent studies harnessing these effects in microfluidic devices for trapping and sorting applications to quantify the relative importance of the determinant physical phenomena dimensionless numbers are often used which express where system lies in fluidic parameter space these dimensionless groups are summarized in table with their mathematical definition and physical interpretation nonlinear effects such as inertia in laminar flows result in cross streamline migration of the particles the relative importance of inertia can be quantified by reynolds number re udh which describes the ratio of inertial to viscous forces with and being the density viscosity and mean velocity of the fluid respectively while dh is the hydraulic diameter of the channel implying the actual diameter in case of circular tube and equal to wh h for rectangular channel with width and height it can be shown that in the limit of zero reynolds number e stokes flow lateral migration of neutrally buoyant particle suspended in confined flow of newtonian fluid is nonexistent due to linearity and thus reciprocality of the system but in the flow regime where re in addition to the drag force in the axial direction transverse forces are exerted on the suspended particles compelling them to migrate laterally towards final stable locations also known as equilibrium positions this phenomenon was first studied in early experiments of segr and silberberg where they observed formation of annular aggregates of neutrally buoyant rigid spheres initially dispersed randomly in pipe flow with re constrained by the lateral lift forces the particles concentrated at radial position at approximately pipe radius creating the so called tubular pinch effect since this discovery many analytical experimental and numerical investigations have been conducted to rationalize the underlying physics of this phenomenon and utilize it in particle manipulation applications based on these studies it has been found that two opposing forces are exerted on rigid neutrally buoyant particle moving along straight channel in shear flow wall repulsion force arising from the asymmetry of the corresponding wake vorticity distribution which tends to push the particles away from the walls and shear gradient lift force originating from the curvature of velocity profile in confined flows which causes the particles to migrate away from the central axis the equilibrium position of the particles is determined by the balance of these forces and depends on the magnitude of reynolds number as well as the blockage ratio defined as dh which describes the relative size of the particle to the channel with being the particle diameter fig schematically shows the geometrical dimensions of spherical particle in square channel using matched asymptotic expansion method to capture both wall effects and oseen like inertial region extensive analytical studies have been performed in the past decades to quantify the lateral migration of particles in the finite reynolds number regime the results indicate lift force scaling as fl a assuming and rp where rp re dh denotes the particle reynolds number and it is measure of flow disturbance induced by the particle motion thus these constrained models are unable to address the finite size effects which later in the numerical work of di carlo et al has been shown to have significant impact on the particle dynamics they investigated nonlinear effects in highly confined flows where the particle size approaches the channel dimensions and introduced new scalings for the lift forces based on their simulations the force scaling varies with the lateral position of the particle in the near wall region the lift force scales as fl cl a whereas close to the channel centerline fl cl a in above equations cl is the dimensionless lift coefficient which depends on the particle distance from the wall and the channel reynolds number the complex variation of cl with re is demonstrated to be in agreement with the experimental observations of matas et al where it has been shown that as re is increased the equilibrium position of the particles moves toward the wall the focusing behavior of the particles has been also studied for channels with square or rectangular shape illustrating fold equilibrium positions distributed symmetrically across the channel cross section moreover the channel aspect ratio has been identified to play an important role in altering the location of particle attractors by weakening the shear gradient induced lift force thus in channels with aspect ratio other than unity the number of focusing positions is reduced to two locations distributed symmetrically along the longer dimension of the channel cross section it has been shown numerically that in high aspect ratio channels blunted velocity profile is formed across the longer face leading to suppression of the strength of shear gradient and amplification of wall effect lift forces due to restricted particle rotation as well as diminished local velocity examining eqs and reveals the strong dependence of inertial lift forces on the particle size suggesting inertial migration as continuous passive mechanism for particle separation and cell purification applications in microfluidic devices in this regard high aspect ratio channels are greatly beneficial as they lower the dispersion of particles and force them to focus along reduced number of equilibrium positions nonetheless it is experimentally observed that in the channels with an aspect ratio higher than threshold bifurcation occurs where each focused stream breaks into two distinct bands undermining the conditions for separation applications the corresponding underlying mechanism for this phenomenon is not clear yet and further study is required to shed light on this issue despite the fact that traditionally inertia is neglected in the microfluidic systems recent studies suggest variety of applications that use the effects of fluid inertial forces these applications including but not limited to cell and particle focusing sorting separation self assembly filtration and enrichment and trapping are poised to be high throughput due to their operation under high flow rates recent progress and potential future directions in the area of inertial microfluidics are discussed in recent review article by di carlo even though prototype systems utilizing inertial microfluidics show more rapid and high throughput outcomes compared to other promising techniques such as microfiltration deterministic lateral displacement and hydrophoresis they lack the ability to increase the concentration of the target cells to significant value this issue is recently resolved by combining microscale laminar vortices with inertial focusing hur et al utilized microvortices generated by inertially driven flow at sharp corners to selectively isolate and trap larger target cells their system consists of straight microchannel with rectangular cross section sufficiently long to allow inertial effects to sort cells based on their size fig sorting is due to the migration of cells particles to distinct lateral equilibrium positions resulting from balance between two aforementioned counteracting lift forces the dimensions of the system are wisely designed such that the equilibrium positions are in the proximity of the channel walls downstream of the channel trapping reservoirs are fabricated as rectangular cavities on the channel wall as result vortices are created within these reservoirs as flow passes through them when the particles reach the cell trapping reservoirs placed downstream of the channel they are exposed only to shear gradient lift larger particles experience larger lateral lift force which drives them across streamline towards the vortex center in the reservoir therefore particles cells with larger size are trapped within these microvortices while smaller ones are flushed out through the channel by operating this device in high flow rate regime re and utilizing parallel reservoirs and channels throughput of cells min has been attained which in microfluidic scales is immense nonetheless the capturing efficiency defined as the ratio of trapped cells to the injected ones does not exceed mostly due to high concentration and deformability effects which hinder the migration toward the walls and thereby cell trapping in the reservoirs similar studies have been conducted to focus and separate rigid spherical particles using finite reynolds number flows in series of alternating contraction expansion channels an example of multistream focusing using this design is shown in fig the so called multiorifice flow fractionation technique although yielding relatively high throughput requires operating in certain narrow range of flow rates to exhibit decent performance in terms of focusing band width and separation efficiency bhagat and coworkers improved this method by introducing pinching region in addition to the focusing region to maintain the cells of interest around the channel centerline fig they used this setup to separate and enrich extremely rare ctcs from whole blood sample with throughput of cells min and collection efficiency of in their design by utilizing high aspect ratio contraction expansion array all blood cells are initially focused close to the channel sidewalls due to inertial lift forces and then by adjusting the width of the pinching region to be on the order of the largest cell size ctcs are refocused along the channel axis while the rest of the cells remain aligned around the sidewalls finally by employing bifurcating outlets ctcs segregated from the red blood cells and peripheral blood leukocytes can be extracted the most important drawback associated with this method is the dependence of pinching zone dimension on the targeted cell size which necessitates fabrication of new microdevice for every type of desired cell in addition to previous applications inertia induced lift forces have been efficiently employed in solution exchange operations in order to transfer cells and particles across reacting solutions in coflow this passive hydrodynamic method is advantageous in terms of exposure time to the shear flow which is extremely shorter compared to conventional cytometry methods involving external fields thus the cell viability and the corresponding gene expressions are much less prone to damage due to transient experience of shear effects however the throughput of this technique is limited to high concentration threshold where particle particle interactions become dominant over the favorable lift forces viscoelastic non newtonian effects provide another mechanism for the cross stream particle migration in microfluidic confined channels which has triggered several investigations in recent years this phenomenon was first observed experimentally by mason and coworkers as they noticed different particle migration directions depending on the properties of the polymeric fluid based on their experiments in pressure driven tube flow the rigid spheres migrate laterally towards the wall in highly shear thinning liquid while are attracted towards the centerline in an elastic fluid with almost constant viscosity boger fluid the latter case has been scrutinized in detail in the experimental work of tehrani who found that in the suspensions of particle volume fraction the migration occurs toward the region of lower shear rate thus in fluids with dominant viscoelastic characteristics particles are pushed towards the centerline in case of poiseuille flow while aggregate close to the outer cylinder wall in couette flow the motion of single particle and two particles in viscoelastic fluids has been studied analytically and numerically to shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the transverse migration ho and leal studied the lift force exerted on neutrally buoyant rigid sphere moving along unidirectional two dimensional confined flow using second order fluid constitutive model and assuming small blockage ratio neglecting inertia effects they employed regular perturbation method in conjunction with the reciprocal theorem to evaluate the lateral force which was shown to be associated with the intrinsic normal stress differences it is argued that the transverse motion stems from hoop thrust arising from the gradient of shear rate across the sphere this elucidation is confirmed by numerical work of huang et al where it is shown that in the limit of negligible inertia and small blockage ratio normal stresses induced by the curvature of the velocity profile force the particle to move towards the centerline where the shear rate is zero on the other hand as the width of the channel becomes smaller and the blockage ratio increases the particle tends to move closer to the wall due to more intensified compressive normal stresses in regions of the channel away from the sidewalls this type of attraction towards the wall for large values of has been observed in experimental study of dhahir et al for whereas analytical studies have been unable to predict it due to limitations of the perturbation methods based on numerical simulations increasing the weissenberg number defined as the product of polymer relaxation time with the shear rate will accelerate the particle motion towards the corresponding equilibrium position in both circumstances here we present heuristic model to quantify the scale of the particle lateral motion engendered by the first and second normal stress differences for the sake of simplicity we neglect the contribution of the second normal stress difference due to the point that for most polymeric fluids n the lift force exerted on rigid small sphere because of elastic effects can be assumed to stem from the imbalance in the distribution of over the size of the particle fe n in the limit of negligible inertia the resulting velocity of lateral migration vl can be derived by balancing this force with stokes drag fd avl where is the fluid viscosity using upper convected maxwell model to obtain the value of r for steady poiseuille flow and assuming near constant viscosity we can calculate the magnitude of the migration velocity as vl r with being the proportionality constant the relaxation time of the polymers and the shear rate hence particles with small blockage ratio in viscoelastic fluids transversely migrate towards the regions of small shear rate which correspond to central axis in tubes and both centerline and corners in case of rectangular channels besides the aforementioned factors shear thinning property of the fluid plays an important role in changing the equilibrium position of the suspended particles it has been first observed in early experiments of mason and coworkers and later confirmed by further numerical and experimental studies that neutrally buoyant rigid particles migrate towards the wall in poiseuille flow of shear thinning fluids avino et al systematically studied this effect in d domain and in an axisymmetric tube using giesekus viscoelastic model which allows for the variation of viscosity with shear rate their results indicate neutral cylindrical surface at r which acts as separatrix to segregate the focus of the particles based on their initial conditions the particles initially suspended at radial position r are attracted towards the wall while others migrate toward the axis line it is found that by increasing the strength of shear thinning the neutral position moves toward the central axis promoting the aggregation of particles on the sidewalls bistability of these two equilibrium positions at intermediate shear thinning regime has been verified in experimental observations of particle distribution in water solution of peo polyethylene oxide see fig in the corresponding flow regime with moderate strength of shear thinning there exists an annular particle free zone because of coexistence of particle aggregates at both centerline and close to the walls it is argued that shear thinning leads to higher shear rate near solid boundaries which results in enhanced migration towards the wall due to modified distribution of compressive normal stresses especially on the side of the particles opposite to the wall in summary the magnitude and direction of the lift force exerted on rigid particle moving with viscoelastic fluid flow with negligible inertia depends on three dimensionless parameters weissenberg number the blockage ratio and nondimensional parameter modulating the extent of shear thinning desired particle focusing scenarios can be achieved by fine tuning these parameters in microfluidic device non newtonian effects either exclusively or in conjunction with other hydrodynamic mechanisms have been recently utilized in several studies for the sake of cell particle focusing and separation using the viscoelastic properties of medium fluid and the corresponding elastic lift force avino and coworkers could attain focusing of particles flowing along capillary tube to enhance the particle migration toward the centerline they adjusted rheological properties of the carrier liquid geometrical characteristics of the experimental apparatus and flow rate thus small blockage ratio inertialess regime and viscoelastic fluid with relatively low degree of shear thinning were preferred to perform the experiments utilizing these conditions ensures the particle migration towards the regions of minimum shear rate which in case of circular tube correspond solely to the centerline although this mechanism is found to be effective over relatively wide range of flow rates its application is limited to low reynolds number regime and thus cannot be considered high throughput method in the same context kim et al used viscoelastic focusing technique to aggregate rigid colloidal nanoparticles at the centerline and corners of square microchannel the effectiveness of the focusing scheme was distinguished to be dependent on the particle size where for small particles no significant ordering in their distribution was observed this can be attributed to pronounced effects of brownian motion as well as weakening of elastic forces as the size of particles decreases the insight resulting from this work can be employed in the design of nanoparticle separation devices in nanoscale territory random brownian effects can play key role in scattering the colloidal particles and inhibiting their alignment the relative importance of brownian diffusive transport can be evaluated using clet number which indicates the ratio of diffusive to convective time scales as pe d where kbt is the brownian diffusivity coefficient with kb being the boltzmann constant and the temperature diffusive effects gain significance because of brownian motion of nanoparticles flowing in microchannel corresponding to pe or due to shear induced particle interactions in case of dense particulate flows however in the dilute regime diffusion induced by brownian motion becomes negligible when m in the fabrication process of microdevices it is more straight forward to build microchannels with rectangular cross section which leads to multiplicity of equilibrium positions in particulate flows to remedy this problem researchers utilized the combination of elastic and inertia forces to enhance the localization of particles by directing their focus toward the channel centerline the relative magnitude of elasticity to inertia forces can be quantified using elastic number defined as el wire dh el is not function of flow rate and only depends on the rheological properties of the polymeric solution and the geometry of the channel the so called elasto inertial regime leading to particle focusing occurs at moderate range of el where effects of both mechanisms are important introducing inertia results in wall repulsion forces which prevent aggregation of particles around channel corners yang et al embraced this idea to design sheathless particle focusing microfluidic device operating in the range of el by tuning the extent of polymer solution and the flow rate they achieved focusing of of particles along the centerline of straight microchannel fig further by exploiting the physics of the lift forces being strongly dependent on the size of the particles they managed to separate the small and large microbeads with separation efficiency of defined as the ratio of number of particles at the outlet to the total number of the particles of the same size injected at the inlet in more recent work higher purities for particle sorting were obtained up to by employing the same elasto inertial effect in more complex setup consisting of sheath and sample flows passing through microchannel with separate exits to collect larger particles around centerline and smaller ones close to the sidewalls see fig these studies seem promising although further research is required to broaden their scope of application for example to wider range of flow rates and to more general types of polymeric fluids with less restrictions on the respective rheological characteristics deformability selective cell the cell deformability is an important biomarker and monitoring its alterations can be of great benefit in diagnosing some lethal diseases such as malaria diabetes and cancer specifically cancer cells have been shown to be much more deformable comparing to the normal cells of the same tissue in addition stiffness of red blood cells rbcs is found to be largely affected by blood diseases such as anaemia as it will be described harnessing hydrodynamic mechanism based on deformability induced lateral migration provides us noninvasive methods to separate infected cells from the healthy ones deformability of particle moving along confined flow introduces another nonlinearity causing cross stream migration even in the limit of stokes flow this phenomenon was first demonstrated theoretically for droplets and later was numerically and experimentally observed for bubbles vesicles and viscous capsules the essential factor responsible for the deformation and consequent lateral migration of droplets is found to be stress matching type of boundary conditions at the corresponding interface instead of no slip condition at the boundary of rigid wall various studies assert the point that the direction of migration depends on the type of deformable particle and its relative viscosity with respect to the surrounding fluid the latter parameter can be quantified by the ratio of internal to external viscosities in out where in refers to the viscosity of droplet fluid or fluid inside an elastic membrane in the case of vesicles and rbcs moreover to account for the degree of deformation different geometrical measures have been proposed such as reduced volume defined as the ratio of actual particle volume to that of sphere with the same surface area s and ii excess area which denotes the area difference of the particle and sphere with equivalent volume sr v in aforementioned equations is the effective particle radius and and are deformed particle volume and area respectively for red blood cells ref and ref the study of deformability as migration mechanism was first initiated in the context of drops it is illustrated both experimentally and theoretically that droplets with viscosity ratio exposed to confined flows shift towards the channel centerline the degree of deformation and the final equilibrium position of the drops are found to be strongly dependent on the viscosity ratio where more viscous drops undergo less shape deformation and travel shorter distances laterally however the steady state of even highly viscous drops is much closer to the centerline compared to the final position of rigid particles mainly due to the presence of slip velocity at the interface of dispersed and continuous phases it is conjectured that existence of non solid boundaries largely contributes to the lateral drift force contrary to our intuition for drops with viscosity ratio smaller than certain threshold experimental and numerical studies have indicated reversal in the direction of migration which in this case is towards the channel wall this shift in lateral motion occurs in spite of shape deformation analogous to higher viscosity drops it is argued that this switch of equilibrium position occurs due to the point that lubrication forces acting in the gap between drop and the wall become inconsequential for less viscous droplets and therefore cannot push them away from the wall another type of soft particles where their lateral motion is of great interest are biological capsules with membranes composed primarily of lipid bilayers also known as vesicles they are generally used in biophysical studies of membranes and red blood cells dynamics suspended in steady shear flow vesicles have been observed to exhibit different dynamical modes including tank treading motion where the vesicle deforms into an ellipsoidal particle with stationary orientation with respect to the flow direction while its membrane is circulating about its interior it is notable that in case of rigid ellipsoid the particle does not maintain fixed inclination but will start to tumble in an unsteady fashion thus deformability plays an essential role in ensuing the tank treading motion experimental observations have indicated that vesicles undergoing tank treading motion in shear flow adjacent to wall experience lateral repulsion force which pushes them away from that wall based on theoretical studies this force stems from the flow disturbances engendered by asymmetric deformation of the vesicles different expressions have been proposed to quantify the magnitude of the resulting transverse drift velocity however they all can be described in terms of separation distance from the wall effective radius and the shear rate in the case of vesicle close to the wall r vl clr and if it is far from the wall r vl clr here cl denotes the dimensionless lift coefficient which has been formulated in various formats for instance in terms of reduced volume as function of viscosity ratio and ellipsoid geometrical measures or in terms of excess area and assuming flow with negligible inertia the corresponding lift force can be calculated using stokes law as fl rvl in these models it is presumed that the lift force always acts in the opposite direction of the wall to push the particle towards the centerline indeed analytical and numerical studies have shown that vesicles unlike surfactant free drops always migrate towards the central axis in poiseuille flow regardless of the value of the viscosity ratio exploiting deformability induced particle migration opens new ways to focus and separate cells based on their inherent structural characteristics which results in passive label free cell sorting processes in microfluidics in most of the pertinent studies this hydrodynamic mechanism is used in conjunction with other effects such as viscoelasticity and inertia but there are few works where cell separation microdevices are solely designed based on the deformability induced cross migration for example geislinger et al separated rbcs from other blood components by harnessing deformability selective cell wall interaction in non inertial flow inside microchannel fig the repulsion force exerted on rbcs in the mode of tank treading motion is much larger compared to platelets causing rbcs to be focused closer to the centerline this technique has been shown to be robust over relatively wide range of flow rates as far as the corresponding reynolds number remains small working in the same inertialess regime yang et al employed lateral lift forces arising from the combinational effects of deformability and viscoelasticity to focus rbcs at the center of microchannel in order to separate them from white blood cells wbcs as mentioned before the particles flowing in viscoelastic medium inside rectangular channel migrate toward the centerline as well as the corners introducing deformability results in additional wall repulsion forces which selectively entrains the particles at the corners considering the point that the deformability induced lift force depends on the asymmetry of the particle it can be inferred that this force is negligible for wbcs due to their near spherical shape hence while rbcs mainly concentrate at the core of the channel wbcs can be selectively extracted along the corners using this setup yang and coworkers could obtain wbcs with purity of from dilute input solution with wbc rbc ratio of the design of their device and snapshot of separated cells are shown in fig although promising this technique needs further development and improvement to be comparable with commercial enrichment methods incorporating the effect of inertia into the previous cell separation techniques can substantially enhance the throughput utilizing this idea hur et al designed microfluidic device for classification and enrichment of different types of cells based on their size and deformability taking advantage of high aspect ratio channels leading to lower number of equilibrium positions they calibrated the device based on the unique lateral location of each category of cells in order to detect and separate them using different outlets across the width of the channel by tuning reynolds number to an optimum value they achieved throughput of cells min while yielding recovery rate for the separation of metastatic breast cancer cells see fig this technique appears to be more effective for more deformable cells compared to stiffer cells in terms of enrichment performance also in this method the range of flow rates should be carefully scrutinized in order not to alter the gene expression of the cells under the effect of shear flow dean in inertial flows inside the channels with curved geometry centrifugal forces create secondary rotational flow called dean flow which is of paramount importance in the flow focusing applications in microfluidics in curved rectangular channels parcel of fluid passing through the central region of the channel is pushed outward due to centrifugal effects and thus to satisfy the incompressibility condition the fluid in the near wall region is driven inwards hence two symmetric vortices on the top and bottom halves of the channel cross section are established leading to the formation of pressure gradient in the radial direction the strength of this secondary flow can be quantified by the dean number de re dh rc where rc denotes the radius of curvature of the channel de can be physically interpreted as the square root of the ratios of centrifugal and inertia forces to the viscous force its direct dependence on the reynolds number implies that the effect of dean flow becomes significant in the inertial regime where re the other important dimensionless parameter where its value largely influences the shape of the vortices is the curvature ratio dh rc different relationships between the velocity of dean flow and the corresponding dean number have been put forward for example ookawara et al proposed the following correlation based on the numerical simulations of the problem with specific configuration ud de but simple scaling arguments as well as experimental results of gossett and di carlo suggest that ud de dh this secondary flow exerts an additional drag force in the lateral direction on the particles moving along the channel axis using the latter expression for ud the drag attributed to dean flow is found to scale as fd adh rc this force always acts in way that constraints the particles to follow the vortex path inertial lift forces fl are also present in the cross stream directions and their balance with dean drag force determines the modified preferred locations of the particles in fact in channels with curved geometry the number of equilibrium positions are reduced compared to straight channels because of destabilizing effect of the dean force specifically equilibrium positions along the midline of the channel between two counter rotating vortices will disappear leaving only two preferred locations for the particle focusing this characteristic of the curved channels makes them more suited for applications in ordering and separation to quantify the interplay between the lift and dean drag forces di carlo and coworkers introduced an inertial force ratio defined as rf flfd rca dh which characterizes different regimes of particulate flows in curved channels it is noteworthy that in the derivation of this ratio the effects of some other components such as channel reynolds number and the lateral position of the particle for the sake of simplicity have been ignored it is argued that weak dependence of rf on these factors does not alter its prowess as characterizing parameter of the system depending on the range of rf three regimes are distinguishable if rf the secondary flow becomes inconsequential compared to inertial effects if rf particles remain unfocused due to dominant strength of rotational flow and if rf an intermediate regime occurs where the number of inertial equilibrium positions are reduced due to dean drag forces gossett and di carlo conducted numerous experiments using particles to obtain phase diagram of the flow for different values of rf and based on their conclusion the intermediate range for their specific configuration starts at rf however the universality of this result is questionable considering lack of generality in the corresponding experiments in terms of variation in particle size and channel aspect ratio beside reducing the number of equilibrium positions including curvature introduces another important advantage over straight channels that can be crucial in terms of energy efficiency it is experimentally observed that when de is large enough particles flowing in curved microchannels reach their final stable positions while traveling shorter distances compared to straight channels with an equivalent flow rate consequently flow focusing applications using curving geometries encounter lower pressure drop due to the skin friction and thus require less pumping power to drive the flow hence using this technique higher throughputs can be attained while maintaining the pressure lower than the leakage threshold dean flow effects have been recently utilized in microfluidic devices for cell particle separation and focusing applications in this regard different curving profiles have been employed such as single curves spirals and serpentine curves among these spirals are the most widely used geometry in microdevices as they yield sufficiently large channel length while occupying minimum surface area the only disadvantage associated with spirals is their intrinsic difficulty with parallelization to fulfill high throughput systems however this problem can be overcome to some extent by taking advantage of higher flow rates which are essential to utilize the full capabilities of dean flow effects papautsky and coworkers were among the first research groups to employ spiral microchannels for the purpose of passive focusing and separation they experimentally and numerically demonstrated that the secondary flow can be used to separate two different particle sizes flowing in an inertial regime inside loop spiral channel with two inlets and two outlets based on their study it was shown that large particles with blockage ratio of aggregate on the inner channel wall due to combined effects of lift and dean drag forces while smaller particles are more dispersed in the outer regions of the channel later they improved their design in terms of throughput as well as the number of separated particle streams see fig utilizing higher flow rates de and employing an additional wider straight channel before the multiple outlets they separated mixture of three different particle sizes with separation efficiency of in both works low aspect ratio channels were preferred w in ref and w in ref to minimize the multiplicity of equilibrium positions due to quadratic dependence of rf on the particle diameter larger particles are driven further towards the inner wall by the inertial forces whereas in case of smaller particles the dominant effect of dean drag forces focus them closer to the centerline and the outer wall this passive mechanism provides robust basis for multistream separation and extraction of particles based on their size the same setup has been also used for the sorting of two types of neural cells achieving separation efficiency of with an incredible throughput of cells min the slight decrease of the separation efficiency can be attributed to the cell deformability effects which prevent the aggregation of the cells close to the walls the operational throughput of such systems working in the inertial regime is limited by two important factors cell viability which might be damaged due to high shear rate effects and clogging problems which are likely to arise in microfluidic designs with multiple constrictions at the outlet despite associated deficiencies spirally shaped microchannels have been widely used in various microfluidic applications such as sheathless flow cytometry cell cycle synchronization and fractionation of asynchronous mammalian cell lines delivery of exogenous dna payloads into cells and single cell droplet encapsulation fig the vortical flow resulting from dean effects have been also used to focus particles passing though microchannels with single curve adjusting the size of the particles and the channel dimensions to maintain the value of rf and employing two sets of sheath flows mao et al attained three dimensional hydrodynamic focusing to ensure single cell passage through the laser beam of flow cytometers the mechanism of their device is schematically shown in fig in this drifting technique focusing is initially achieved because in the small rf regime inertial lift forces are negligible leading to particles entrainment by dean vortices and their aggregation along the channel midline in the next step horizontal sheath flows injected normal to the axial direction create focusing along the centerline using the aforementioned setup throughput of particles min for flow cytometry applications has been fulfilled however further study is required to confirm the robustness of this method when dealing with deformable cells instead of rigid particles serpentine channels with variable radii of curvature and alternating curving directions provide high throughput hydrodynamic focusing and separation techniques via parallelization on single substrate the pioneering work of di carlo et al illustrated the potential of this type of geometry for cell particle ordering purposes in the inertial flow it is observed that in asymmetric curving geometries the destabilization of the equilibrium positions due to dean flow is amplified leading to formation of single stream of particles in shorter travelled distances compared to the straight or symmetrically curved channels see fig as the threshold pressure associated with the leakage is the main limiting design factor in such systems the serpentine geometry renders higher capacity to increase the throughput due to its inherently lower pressure drop using this technique di carlo et al focused cells at rate of cells min with negligible damage to their viability this method although advantageous in terms of not requiring additional sheath flows is operationally limited to specific range of flow rates for optimum focusing performance the corresponding interval of optimal channel reynolds number can be approximately inferred from the phase diagram of particle ordering in curved microchannels in terms of associated value of rf and the degree of focusing vortex induced trapping provides promising approaches for high throughput size selective separation of cells and particles these vortices can be generated using the geometrical modification of the channel profile by acoustic streaming or via electrokinetic methods such as induced charge electro osmosis ac electro osmosis and dielectrophoresis the optimum conditions for particle trapping in confined microvortex flows have been analyzed analytically and numerically by liu et al using the concepts of nonlinear dynamics it has been shown that introducing non hydrodynamic forces can substantially improve the efficiency of vortical point and ring traps in this section brief review of studies regarding the production of vortices by means of streaming bubbles or solid boundaries is presented oscillating bubbles have shown great deal of promise in fluid and particle cell manipulation in microfluidic systems they are greatly beneficial in number of proposed applications in chemical biological and physical processes such as mixing pumping characterizing enzymatic reactions cell lysis and sorting and enrichment thorough review article on applications of oscillating microbubbles in microfluidics is recently written by hashmi et al although there are number of techniques to generate bubbles in microfluidic channels using cavity is found to be the simplest upon generation of the bubble piezoelectric transducer can be coupled with the device to oscillate the bubble despite being simple this manner of inducing bubble oscillation is rather accurate and efficient upon oscillation bubble can vibrate under linear or non linear response depending upon the amplitude of the vibration the fast vibration of the bubble interface produces second order streaming flow that has steady component however time averaging leaves only the steady part since sampling rate is at rates much slower than oscillation frequency the steady flow known as cavitation microstreaming has streaming reynolds number defined as res f where a and are the kinematic viscosity of the liquid bubble radius oscillation amplitude and frequency respectively depending on bubble oscillates in different oscillation modes however oscillation amplitude and the corresponding cavitation microstreaming are more pronounced when the bubble is excited at its resonance frequency for res flow is described as rayleigh nyborg westervelt rnw streaming and can be modeled using the method of images and singularity the maximum streaming velocity which is located near the bubble can then be approximated from us af however in high applied voltages and typical applied frequencies in microfluidic systems khz khz res which makes the theoretical solution more complicated as the full navier stokes equations must be solved nevertheless rnw streaming can describe the flow in these cases quite accurately within typical microfluidic experimental setup the streaming velocity is on the order of mm to cm which makes the manipulation of the liquid and particles in microchannels using oscillating bubbles powerful yet efficient and simple technique compared to electrokinetics and electrophoresis recently wang et al used the cavitation microstreaming of bubble together with poiseuille flow to manipulate particles and their spatial concentration for enrichment filtering and focusing applications in microfluidic devices the working mechanism is based on the fact that particles behave differently around the oscillating bubbles depending on their finite size when the relative streaming strength ratio defined as u us where p is the mean poiseuille velocity is low the streaming flow dominates near the bubble with two vortices under this condition near the oscillating bubble particles larger than critical size ap dgap where ap is the particle radius and dgap is characteristic size of the gap dictating the critical size are forced to move across the streamlines towards the vortex of microstreaming and eventually be trapped in the streaming this is due to the fact that the particles cannot penetrate the bubble so they move across streamlines because of finite size effects the gap width dgap which is the distance between the surface of the bubble and closed streamlines in the vortex can be theoretically predicted using geometry argument as dgap sh h h here is the width of the channel and is the portion of the channel width in which the streamlines are rectified to pass through dgap when the streaming is present near the bubble the equation for obtaining dgap is derived using the conservation of mass which dictates that the mass flux in portion of the channel must pass through the gap between the closed streamlines and the bubble this mechanism described schematically in fig can lead to high concentration of the target particles in vicinity of the bubbles which can be used for particle enrichment fig however as the number of trapped particles increases particle particle interactions eventually lead to the release of particles from the vortex these interactions such as collisions and hydrodynamic interactions cause perturbations in the particle trajectories which allow particles to enter the region of open streamlines the release of the particles occurs at narrow region near the bubble pole where the perturbations are stronger wang et al used the releasing technique for focusing applications since the release trajectory is narrower than the trajectories far upstream of the bubble depending on dgap more than one size of particles can be trapped within the vortical flow as these particles are transported in the streaming flow they gradually settle into different closed trajectories depending on their size as illustrated in fig the small particle orbits on larger loop while the large particle orbits on smaller trajectory the same cavitation microstreaming approach based on finite size effects can be used to collect motile bacterial cells in the vortical flow of an oscillating bubble as shown by yazdi and ardekani in this case they observed rapid formation of biofilm streamers which occurs due to the presence of the microstreaming vortices they also showed that bacterial motility affects the rate of collection of bacteria in the vortices suggesting that bacteria with high motility are trapped faster and more intense in the vortical flow fig shows the collection of bacteria in the microstreaming of an oscillating bubble and the biofilm streamer formed after three minutes hydrodynamic an alternative way of trapping cells by acoustic streaming is by utilizing an oscillating solid boundary in microfluidic system the solid boundary can be fixed cylinder in the middle of the channel see fig or sharp edge of cavity in the channel wall by applying low audible frequencies hz hz time averaged secondary streaming known as steady streaming similar to cavitation microstreaming is generated adjacent to the solid boundary these streamings are driven by reynolds stresses that are created within the stokes layer near solid boundaries representative streamlines of the streaming flow at different planes of symmetry have been shown in figs and stokes layer thickness ac is scaling parameter for oscillating flows that describes how far from surface the viscous damping of an oscillating boundary persists here and are fluid kinematic viscosity and cylinder oscillation frequency respectively lutz et al used this technique for dynamic single cell measurements the secondary flow in the vicinity of fixed oscillating cylindrical obstacle in microfluidic channel with radius of was used to trap and suspend single cells including motile cells upon applying the audible frequency fluid oscillation the trapping force draws the cell toward the cylinder the magnitude of the trapping force which is directly related to the amplitude of oscillation is up to pn and it is of the same order of magnitude as forces induced by optical tweezers and dielectrophoretic traps however unlike these techniques the magnitude of shear stress generated by the oscillating fluid is m which is within the physiological range for cells and arterial blood flow location of the trapping is near the eddy center and it is controlled via the oscillation frequency they have further shown that by adjusting the applied frequency device geometry and fluid kinematic viscosity the depth of the trapping eddy can be matched to the diameter of the cell therefore despite the different initial positions of the cells they are ultimately positioned at specific location within the channel midplane it should be noted that due to the low range of applied frequency and intensity the acoustical effects associated with radiation force and bulk energy absorption are not important here recently they expanded their design to cavities as well as other obstacles in microfluidic channel and investigated the effect of design geometry on steady streaming flow shape structure and strength by conducting the experiments in channels with different oscillating boundaries in this work they improved upon their previous observation and showed that the trapping location is closer to the solid boundary than the core of the eddy the overall reported results of the particle trapping are quite similar among different posts however steady flow structure strength and trapping stability in cavities are significantly different employing hydrodynamic effects in microfluidic applications has been distinguished in the past decade to be fruitful both in terms of throughput and efficiency and continues to thrive in the future through further improvements in separation resolution and processing rate however there are new areas for applications of hydrodynamic microfluidic phenomena which appear promising and demand further investigations both theoretically to inform researchers of the underlying physics and experimentally to exploit them in biological applications although several active separation techniques have been developed to meet the growing demand in these new territories they lack the associated advantages of the passive methods reviewed in previous sections such as ease of design and maintaining the viability of genes sorting micro nano scale chiral objects by means of lateral drift induced by shear flow is among those areas requiring further studies chirality is common property of many biomolecules including well celebrated dna strands separating these molecules based on their chirality is strongly useful in variety of applications ranging from food industries to pharmaceutical products considering the inherent difficulties of the currently available methods several attempts have been made to harness chirality induced lift forces arising in shear flow to separate the molecules recently marcos et al presented technique to fulfill this purpose achieving an ample efficiency for the separation of microscale dormant helical bacteria nevertheless further work is required to expand the scope of this method in terms of operating at higher throughput and separating smaller chiral objects at nanoscale proceeding in this context cross stream migration in viscoelastic medium has been utilized to focus two types of double helical dna molecules radii of gyration m in the vicinity of the centerline of microchannel however the throughput of this technique is limited due to its operational flow rate corresponding to re by decreasing the size of the molecules brownian diffusive effects become significant which tend to destroy the focusing and alignment of separated objects it will be interesting to seek new methods to remedy this problem and broaden the application of microfluidic techniques even though trapping and ordering processes are well studied for non motile cells the interplay of cell motility with other hydrodynamic effects influencing the lateral migration is mostly overlooked however in recent years few studies have been conducted to shed light on the interaction between swimming behavior and shear flow for example durham et al experimentally demonstrated the generation of intense accumulations of phytoplankton in the high shear regions of confined flows due to tumbling behavior of the cells triggered by excessive hydrodynamic torque in the microfluidic framework hashemi et al designed and fabricated flow cytometer comprised of two sheath flows and central sample stream in order to hydrodynamically focus and characterize various phytoplankton species also ardekani and gore have analytically shown that cross stream migration induced by viscoelasticity can be used to aggregate bacterial cells in vortical flow in order to generate large enough concentrations of microorganisms required for detection procedures from practical point of view detection of microorganisms such as bacteria is important in medical diagnosis and microbiological analysis of food water and environmental samples thus another prominent area for future research can be towards providing insight upon the basic physics of lateral migration of motile cells in confined flows and its application in environmental and biological studies  the southern australian margin is one of the most energetic regions in the world suitable for the extraction of wave energy for electricity generation we have produced data set in which the deep water wave energy resource for the region is described by three representative deep water wave states equivalent to the th th and th percentiles of the deep water wave energy flux derived from archives of the usa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa wavewatch iii nww operational wave model the simulating waves nearshore swan wave model is then applied along the full southern australian margin to propagate these representative wave states into the near shore region to quantify the effects of shallow water processes such as refraction shoaling and bottom friction the wave energy incident on the isobath kw is approximately less than the world energy council estimates of offshore wave energy but is approximately greater than the energy observed from long term buoy deployments on the midshelf the latter discrepancy is attributed to an overestimation of significant wave height along the southern australian margin by the nww model the near shore model applied in this study adequately simulates the attenuation of wave heights across the continental shelf when compared with estimates of wave height attenuation obtained from the topex satellite altimeter the attenuation of wave energy across the continental shelf reduces the estimates of offshore wave energy as given by the world energy council however the wave energy resource incident on the southern australian margin remains considerable we estimate that if of the incident near shore energy in this region which is an ambitious target when conversion efficiency is considered were converted to electricity approximately tw yr one half of australia total present day electricity consumption would be produced the australian government has set target for renewable energy by to expand the use of renewable energy as part of its commitment to reduce australia greenhouse gas emissions by on levels by to achieve this goal an additional gw yr of renewable energy will have to be produced by wave energy has number of advantages over other renewable energy sources environmentally impacts occur during the construction and installation processes once in operation wave energy has the potential to provide clean source of energy with no greenhouse gas emissions while posing minimal impacts on the environment noteworthy advantage of wave energy conversion devices is that many have low visibility profile seafloor designs are essentially invisible while surface designs protrude only few meters above the ocean surface and are barely seen when installed several kilometers offshore these features make wave energy more appealing to nearby residents who have objected to wind turbines and solar farms on the grounds that they spoil coastal areas of high recreational value objections to wave energy farms have been made by competing industry sectors g transport and fishers on grounds of the potential hazard to navigation and access to resources recreational users g surfers on grounds of the potential for reducing incident coastal wave energy and public utilities commissions g electricity corporations on grounds of the high cost per unit energy associated with high maintenance expenses in early stages of the industry uncertainties remain on the effects of long term deployment of wave generation devices on the marine and coastal environments the wave hub site in the united kingdom is providing useful test bed for research in this field fundamental aspect to tapping wave energy is resource characterization initial estimates of wave energy potential have identified the southern margin of the australian continent as one of the most energetic wave climates suitable for wave energy generation the world energy council estimates however are based on deep water information while wave energy generation systems are typically positioned relatively near to shore with the offshore systems positioned in depth ranges of wave energy developers therefore require assessments of near shore wave energy that take into account the various transformations that take place as waves propagate across the continental shelf in this work we aim to refine the estimates of near shore wave energy potential for the world class wave energy resource along the southern australian margin taking into account the redistribution of wave energy density over the best available shallow water bathymetry at spatial resolution for this km stretch of coast we have used the long term archives of the usa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa wavewatch iii nww operational wave model which hemer et al identified as the most suitable wave model for the australian region to characterize the offshore deep water wave climate using this analysis of the deep water wave data the dominant and extreme sea states were identified and propagated into the near shore using the simulating waves nearshore swan wave model which accounts for refraction shoaling bottom friction and sheltering from coasts and islands swan and wavewatch iii are both widely used spectral wave models that have been validated in wide range of situations both models are governed by the same principle where the evolution of the wave spectrum in space and time is described by conservation of action density being balanced by source terms representing generation dissipation and wave wave interaction processes the action density is the energy density divided by the relative frequency wavewatch iii tends to be more efficient at global scales whereas swan offers advantages at smaller scales and its specific consideration of shallow water processes the swan model was implemented for this study to make use of these advantages the resultant map of wave energy resource is expected to complement the other issues that arise when determining suitable locations to extract wave energy such as proximity to ports navigation routes and aquaculture and fishing areas as well as proximity to the energy grid this paper is organized in five sections as follows this introduction is followed by sec ii outlining the methods applied results of the study are presented in sec iii section iv discusses the results in the context of australia energy use and sec presents the main conclusions of the study hemer et al assessed number of available wave models for the australian region for their suitability to describing the australian wave climate the archived output of noaa operational wave model an implementation of the wavewatch iii model nww ref was shown to compare best with waverider buoy data from sites located on exposed sections of the australian coast however nww has two distinct limitations as an information resource for assessing wave energy potential first the model archives include only integrated wave parameters significant wave height hs which describes the largest of the waves in the instantaneous wave field peak wave period tp which describes the most energetic waves in the spectrum and peak wave direction which describes the direction of waves corresponding to tp the directional wave spectra are not available second the spatial resolution of the nww model is latitude longitude and thus any climatology derived directly from the nww archives is not directly applicable to the near shore zone until the cross shelf wave transformations are taken into account deep water wave spectral wave measurements along the south western australian margin here defined as extending from perth to hobart indicate that the wave climate in this region is dominated by unimodal energy within the swell spectral band e waves with period greater than refs and the region is considered near enough to the extratropical storms which generate the waves in the southern ocean so that little separation between the sea and swell bands is observed in the wave spectrum the wave climate along the south western margin of the australian continent is therefore adequately described as unimodal wave climate which can be characterized by the integrated wave parameters in the nww archives in contrast the south eastern australian margin receives waves from large latitudinal range spanning the southern tasman sea to the coral sea in the north as consequence bimodal wave state often exists so archives of spectrally integrated parameters such as from nww cannot accurately describe the wave climate along the south eastern australian coast using the yr hourly archives of hs tp and from the nww wave model time series of wave energy flux ef is calculated at all nww grid points in the domain s assuming theoretical pierson moskowitz pm spectral shape e ef epm hs tp cg d where epm hs tp is the pm wave energy spectrum as function of hs tp and wave frequency and cg is the group wave speed as function of and water depth and is determined using the approach described in hemer et al water depth is derived from the geoscience australia ga bathymetry database averaged over the nww grid cell tp the only wave period parameter archived from nww is not the preferred wave period parameter for conducting energy resource assessments ideally the wave energy period te derived from the zeroth and first negative moments of the frequency spectrum is used for wave energy resource assessments as te corresponds to the weighted average of the wave energy we overcome this data constraint by assuming theoretical pm spectrum assuming deep water wave conditions the pm spectrum introduces the approximate relationship between tp and the mean wave period tz tp tz such that eq reduces to the international energy agency recommended equation for determining wave energy flux from integrated wave parameters e ef tzhs tphs by using eq the need to assume deep water wave conditions which may not be appropriate for long swell as occurs on the south australian continental shelf is removed the choice of unimodal pm spectrum is appropriate for the fully developed unimodal sea swell observed along australia south western margin in regions with bimodal seas g the south eastern australian continental margin the recent development of theoretical multipeaked directional wave spectra may enable extension of the approach taken in this study in this study we have limited our analysis to unimodal seas applicable to the south western australian continental margin the th th and th percentiles of ef are determined at all nww grid points ef ef and ef respectively for each of the months of the year and for the whole yr archive these parameters summarize the spatial and seasonal distribution of the wave energy resource for the southern australia deep water region near shore wave as waves travel over the continental shelf toward shallower water they start to feel the sea bed once the water depth is less than half the wavelength number of depth dependent processes become important including refraction shoaling and bottom friction these shallow water processes may modify the spatial distribution of wave energy typically observed as an attenuation of energy across the continental shelf to quantify the wave energy in the near shore and identify locations optimal for wave energy extraction we applied the swan wave model to propagate specified wave conditions from deepwater into the near shore regions of the southern australian margin ten midresolution and km model domains were configured along the southern margin of the australian continent fig bathymetry of each domain was derived from the ga bathymetry each of the model domains was chosen so that the seaward boundary aligned with the center of nww grid points near to the continental shelf edge directional resolution of and frequency bins over the range of hz were specified hemer calibrated the wave model for the grid which contains the cape de couedic waverider buoy model parametrizations of bed friction wind generation and whitecapping parametrizations the directional spreading of the boundary input directional wave spectrum and the presence of quadruplet or triad wave wave interactions were investigated calibration was carried out by minimizing error in the wave height simulation being considered more important than the wave period using each parametrization the model was run in stationary mode for individual sea states with the timing of these runs corresponding to the time of satellite altimeter passes over the model domain hemer found that in this region wave conditions were well described using forcing from swell boundary conditions only with no local wind forcing with root mean square error hs of in these circumstances wind growth and whitecapping source terms within swan are unnecessary and hemer found that the calibration was largely insensitive to bed friction parametrization at these scales the frictional drag law of collins was implemented with friction parameter of defined under these conditions swan was most sensitive to the directional spreading factor cosine power of the incoming swell at the open boundaries of the domain and value of provided best model data agreement following these calibration experiments the same parameters were chosen for all model grids the swan wave model was run in stationary mode for representative sea states corresponding to ef ef and ef for and as defined above for each midresolution domain for the ef m case where is the percentile or representative wave conditions are chosen as the mean of those waves which lie within the representative band of energy flux e hs m mean hs tx tp m mean tp tx qp m arg mean ei tx where tx are the times in the year archive for which the month is m or as defined above and ef is within five percentile levels of the xth percentile of ef for example the annual wave height associated with the th percentile of wave energy flux ef was determined as the mean of all wave heights for which wave energy flux was greater than the th percentile of all ef values and less than the th percentile of all ef values boundary conditions for the midresolution domain runs were then defined by assuming pm shaped spectrum and linearly interpolating between nww grid cells along the open boundary landward of the nearest grid cell to the coast is assumed to have constant wave properties fine resolution near shore wave properties were determined by nesting total of model domains within the ten midresolution grids which spanned the southern australian coast fig default one way swan nesting was used to force the model runs and the same swan parameters were used within the model runs as tuned for the parent run therefore in total stationary swan model runs were carried out made up from domains ten grids grids for three sea state scenarios th th and th percentiles for temporal periods and as defined above the computational cost was approximately on single ghz intel xeon cpu requiring approximately gb ram and produced approximately gb data validation of wave height and energy waverider buoy data from three sites located along the southern australian margin were used to validate the wave energy maps table again only integrated wave parameters hs and tp are archived from the waveriders and consequently wave energy flux was determined using eq assuming pm spectral shape th th and th percentiles of wave energy flux at each of the three sites were determined for and as defined above and compared to modeled ef values from the closest model grid cell the corresponding hs and tp values were also compared no directional data is available for model comparison in order to assess the ability of the swan wave model to attenuate the wave heights across the continental shelf we compared atlas derived significant wave heights with wave heights estimated from topex poseidon satellite altimeter records comparisons were made at offshore dw sites and continental shelf sw sites which lie on eight specified ascending satellite tracks which pass over the southern australian margin fig significant wave heights were obtained at each of the locations from the altimeter record for all available cycles between and from october to october data were rejected using the same procedure as specified in hemer et al and corrected using the calibration equations derived by challenor and cotton the altimeter passes over each point once every days at each point the th th and th percentiles of wave height were determined these altimeter derived hs percentiles were compared with corresponding estimates from the atlas as was the ratio of the dw sw hs in order to compare the modeled and observed rates of cross shelf attenuation as well as the absolute energy levels recall that the atlas derived percentile values are derived from percentiles of the energy flux and not just hs we have measured the impact of the other factors period and direction in the energy flux by comparing variously derived percentiles using time series data from the nww model and found less than difference between the different ways of defining the hs percentiles so we treated the definitions as if they are equivalent figures display plots of nww hs versus tp and hs versus bivariate probability distribution functions pdf for four example nww grid cells that were used to define boundary conditions for the near shore models also shown on these plots are the corresponding hs tp and values associated with the three energy flux percentiles for the southern margin figs the wave conditions associated with the th th and th percentiles of wave energy flux adequately describes the distribution of wave properties at these sites as evidenced by the fact that the black dots lie in or close to high density regions of the wave parameter space the same is not true however for the south eastern region fig where the distribution of wave properties is clearly bimodal comprising mix of eastward and westward propagation and short and long periods recalling that the data set analyzed here is unimodal on day by day basis this property of bimodality can only have come from the time dimension of the nww data set analysis of the full spectral information would doubtlessly show an even greater spread of the wave direction statistics which points to the relative importance of local wind forcing our omission of local wind forcing in the nested swan models is consistent with focus on areas where the wave climate is unimodal and dominated by remotely generated waves these conditions are not satisfied east of the southern tip of tasmania so we have restricted the domain of our output data sets to the region where our approach is most valid namely the south western shelf as defined above since this is the region of greatest wave energy in australia we think it is an appropriate region on which to focus for the purposes of the australian renewable energy industry validation of wave height and energy the wave energy flux predicted by the near shore high resolution swan models exceeds the wave energy flux estimated from buoy data for each of the three sites for almost the entire year for each sea state case th th and th ef percentiles fig for the th percentile median all month estimates of energy flux the relative errors of the model are and at the three buoy locations table ii this is due to the modeled wave heights exceeding the observed heights by and an error that is partially offset by the modeled wave periods being too short by and compared to the observations the relative errors of the th percentile values are larger while those of the th percentile values are smaller for example the th percentile model energy flux at cape sorell is larger than the buoy estimate due to the height being too great but the period too short table ii in the deep ocean where the best available validation data type is satellite altimetry we find that the model estimates of wave height exceed the satellite estimates table iii by at all locations for the th percentile values and west of for the median values the relative size of the th percentile values is inconsistent alternating from track to track but the relative errors are all less than many less than recall that principal motive of the present work was to model the attenuation of hs across the continental shelf for all locations across the south of australia table iii lists the ratio of deep and shallow water wave heights at the locations of the satellite tracks the model and altimeter based estimates of the attenuation rate agree well with consistent values of about for narrow shelf regions and or where the shelf is wider wave energy our wave energy resource atlas consists of maps of resolution over the domain s the maps are made up from four variables wave energy flux significant wave height peak wave period and peak wave direction for representative sea states these sea states are defined as representing one of three th th or th percentile levels of the wave energy flux for each of the individual months and for all months combined and respectively figure shows maps of the wave energy flux for the three all month percentile levels results for individual months are viewable via the australian federal government renewable energy atlas http www environment gov au sustainability renewable atlas index html and csiro marine and atmospheric research ocean renewable energy website http www marine csiro au griffin ore see supplementary material an inspection of the maps reveals both the value and limitations of our approach the principal motivation of this work was to provide accurate estimates across southern australia of the degree of attenuation suffered by the deep ocean waves as they cross the continental shelf into the near shore this effect is seen quite clearly there are also however number of modeling and or plotting artifacts that the user of the maps should bear in mind an obvious one is that the wave properties are discontinuous where the various model domains overlap second is the quantization of the peak wave period in the nested swan models see tp plots in supplementary material the least obvious artifact is that islands and headlands cast unrealistically sharp shadows this is because the th percentile map shows for example what the wave properties would be on day when the offshore wave height was equal to the median value and the direction and period equal to the corresponding values the shadows would be more diffuse if we had run the many nested models for many actual years and then computed the statistics from the time histories of the nested models such an approach would be much more computer intensive but the varying angles of incidence would allow time averaged rather than snapshot estimates of the wave properties to be calculated along coast integral of the wave energy integration of the flux propagating across the full length of the depth contour from in the west to was carried out on all wave energy flux maps table iv summer is the time of least wave energy with the th th and th percentile integrated energy flux being and gw in january in july these rise to and gw these figures indicate that the resource is fairly reliable it is only for about of the time and here we should recall that the nwwiii archive comprises estimates of wave properties at intervals of that the energy flux falls to less than half the median conversely it is only for about of the time that the energy flux exceeds twice the median value averaged over the whole year australia southern coastline has sustained wave energy resource of gw tw yr in australia generated around tw yr of electricity from an estimated total capacity of gw presently approximately of electricity generation is from coal with about from black coal the wave energy resource along australia southern margin gw is approximately three times australia total installed capacity if of the incident wave energy could be converted to electricity approximately one half of australia present day electricity needs could be satisfied assessing the engineering feasibility the cost or impact of converting this amount of wave energy to electricity is outside the scope of the present study our aim is simply to assess the extent of the energy resource and to characterize its variability our modeled wave energy estimates exceed buoy derived estimates by considerable margin when waves are small and by significant margin at other times this overestimation of wave energy is consistent with the overestimation of hs observed at the deep water sites where comparison between model values effectively at the boundaries at which nww input data are specified and satellite altimeter data has been carried out table iii we therefore attribute this error to the overestimation of hs in the region by the nww model an alternative data set that could have been used to provide the offshore boundary conditions for the nested domain swan models in this study is the one analyzed by hughes and heap we did not use it because the discrepancy from buoy observations is much greater problem common to many sources of renewable energy is the unpredictability of yield raising concerns regarding their capacity to produce base load electricity demand without storage wind and solar energy systems are susceptible to the rapid temporal variability of their associated natural processes the weather systems responsible for this variability have scales of km so whole regions are impacted at once not just individual farms five representative sites along the southern australian margin are chosen as potential sites for wave energy extraction which are proximal to the existing australian grid table four of these sites would connect to the australian national electricity grid nem while the fifth would connect to the west australian grid only we use time series of ef computed directly from the nww archives at each site we sum the energy across the four nem sites and across all five sites and compute percentile e p nefx where represents site where or and indicates percentile and these values are compared with the sums of percentiles presented in this paper from deep water nww values e p n efp the comparison provides measure of the spatial variability of the incident wave energy available to the national electricity grid summing over the nem sites only during low wave conditions th percentile case is larger than indicating that during low wave conditions distributing wave energy devices along the full extent of the nem grid along the south coast provides only minimal increase in energy available for the grid if summed over all five sites e if the wa and nem grids were connected is larger than indicating that when low wave conditions are experienced along the sa vic and tas coasts larger portion of wave energy could be input to the grid from the western australia sites these results are consistent with those presented by hemer et al which showed only h lag between wave events being observed off the south australian coast and off the west coast of tasmania and indicate wave energy devices connected to the nem will likely be coincidentally low energy storage systems would be required in order to provide consistent power supply from wave energy alone the australian government has set target for renewable energy by requiring an additional gw while an economic analysis of wave generation in australian waters is yet to be carried out possibly with the development of this atlas the massive availability of resource particularly when considered within the context of other renewable resources suggests that the target is certainly achievable our near shore wave energy resource maps describe resource that is approximately less than the world energy council estimates for the southern australian margin but greater than the estimates of hughes and heap our model derived wave energy estimates are approximately greater than estimates from buoy data we attribute this to overestimation of significant wave height in the region by the nww model in the region of the australian national electricity grid the wave energy resource is essentially spatially uniform when wave heights become low they become so over the full stretch of the nem with only short delay across the whole southern margin local storage or production offsetting rather than long distance transmission is therefore perhaps the more appropriate way of managing the variability unlike some forms of renewable energy however the range of the energy yield fluctuations is not extreme the yield is half the median value only of the time it is also probably fair to say although we have not proven this in this study that the time scale of variation and or the unpredictable component of that is somewhat longer for waves than it is for wind or solar we attribute this to the simple fact that waves result from the action of winds averaged over very large distance away from the diurnally varying heating and topographic effects of land the data set presented in this study aims to provide suitable data set for informing policy with details of the available wave energy in australia priority near shore regions for harnessing wave energy the data will also further refine the most suitable locations for commercialization of wave energy converters of interest to the wave energy industry however this user group will require wave energy time series data providing for example details of threshold exceedances above and below which device fails to operate not available from this study to enable complete assessment of the suitability of the wave energy resource for site specific locations for specific devices high spatial resolution wave transformation model as applied in this study run with time variable boundary and local wind conditions for period of approximately yr or more should be regarded as the next step to adequately define the wave climate for wave energy resource assessments the required model should be applied with single domain so that modeling artifacts observed in the present study are removed unstructured grids are now supported by swan ref and may prove suitable for future wave energy assessments for the extensive southern australian domain investigated here to support the required modeling effort we recommend greater investment in in situ observations along the southern australian margin in the form of directional waverider buoys or similar presently there is dearth of directional observations in this region hemer and bye identified offshore wave direction as the single most important parameter dictating attenuation of wave energy across the south australian continental shelf proper verification of wave models in this region would therefore ensure that wave direction is suitably represented which is not possible with the currently available observational data the australian government seeks to produce gw yr of additional renewable energy before the southern margin of the australian continent provides an abundant resource of wave energy which can contribute to this target typical annual mean wave energy fluxes along the southern margin are approximately kw gw yr km the total required renewable energy quota could be achieved if of the available wave energy resource over km section of the southern australian margin were converted to electricity  an imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence spectrometer at the vacuum ultraviolet vuv beamline of the swiss light source is presented and few initial measurements are reported monochromatic synchrotron vuv radiation ionizes the cooled or thermal gas phase sample photoelectrons are velocity focused with better than mev resolution for threshold electrons and also act as start signal for the ion time of flight analysis the ions are accelerated in relatively low cm field which enables the direct measurement of rate constants in the range all electron and ion events are recorded in triggerless multiple start multiple stop setup which makes it possible to carry out coincidence experiments at khz event frequencies as examples the threshold photoelectron spectrum of the argon dimer and the breakdown diagrams for hydrogen atom loss in room temperature methane and the chlorine atom loss in cold chlorobenzene are shown and discussed energy selected ions have been prepared and analyzed with photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy pepico for slightly more than years linear momenta and energy are conserved in photoionization processes thus the internal energy of the parent ion is defined by the initial internal energy of the neutral species the photon energy the ionization energy and the kinetic energy of the electron energy selected electrons are used as start signal for measuring the ion time of flight tof distribution two different approaches have been employed for electron energy analysis a fixed energy light source is used and the electron energies are selected by dispersive analyzer or a tunable light source is employed and only threshold electrons are detected process often termed as threshold pepico or tpepico benefits of the tpepico technique are the much higher collection efficiency for threshold electrons than for kinetic ones better than as well as higher electron energy resolution better than mev possible the major disadvantage is the contamination of the threshold electron signal by energetic electrons hot electrons which are difficult to distinguish from true threshold electrons by simple line of sight analyzers that discriminate electrons on the basis of their angular divergence several approaches have been used to eliminate the hot electron contamination in the first one an achromatic electron extraction lens is followed by dispersive analyzer which stops most but not all hot electrons more recently szt ray and baer developed velocity focusing optics that focuses threshold electrons onto small aperture and uses second off axis aperture close by that collects only energetic electrons by subtracting the hot electron pepico signal from the threshold signal they obtained clean threshold coincidence spectra limited by the mev monochromator resolution although this scheme has been proven to work to within mev its applicability for photoelectron spectra rich in peaks is determined by the distance between the two apertures which is ultimately limited by the channeltron diameter pulsed photon source such as synchrotron storage ring operated g in single bunch mode can also be used to select true threshold electrons by their tof however the very low extraction fields required for good electron energy resolution and therefore the need to pulse ions out of the ionization region results in structured false coincidence spectrum that is not easily separated from the true coincidences different approach using pulsed field ionization pfi was pioneered by ng and co workers at the advanced light source where they used the ns dark gap in the multibunch mode to field ionize the high rydberg states and collected these by selectively gating the electronics to pass the pfi electrons while suppressing the prompt ones although this approach provides very high resolution of mev it has the severe disadvantage that it also requires the use of very low electric fields that prohibit the ion from being efficiently extracted from the ionization region using the average extraction field of less than cm the ion tof distributions were not sharp and could not be used to analyze slow photodissociations in addition the yield of pfi electrons was low nevertheless this experiment set standard for high resolution energy selection of ions in pulsed experiments the need to minimize false coincidences constrains the experimental setup the expected number of ionization events has to be around one per pulse thereby lengthening the data acquisition time in continuous single start single stop ss and single start multiple stop sm experiments the count rates are still limited by the false coincidence background it is only the multiple start multiple stop mm data acquisition technique that was shown to allow arbitrarily high ionization rates as long as the detectors and the electronics are not paralyzed by the signal in this report we present new imaging pepico experiment based on quasicontinuous light source providing an energy resolution e coupled to electron velocity focusing optics that is capable of sub mev resolution for threshold electrons this imaging pepico ipepico at the db vacuum ultraviolet vuv beamline of the swiss light source sls is designed to handle ionization event rates in excess of khz by recording all electron and ion signals the electron velocity imaging detector enables electron kinetic energy analysis in the mev range with v cm extraction field the ipepico experiment is thus cross between tpepico and pepico apparatuses with dispersive electron kinetic energy analyzers the electron kinetic energy analysis and the ion tof analysis are carried out simultaneously in the following sections we describe the light source the vacuum system the electron and ion optics and the data acquisition system and illustrate the performance by reporting few benchmark measurements the main improvement with respect to previous synchrotron based experiments is the use of higher extraction fields that provide tof spectra with comparably good resolution and the simultaneous electron kinetic energy analysis with better than mev resolution light only brief overview of the vuv beamline at the sls is given here the bending magnet radiation is collimated using copper mirror with platinum reflective coating with vertical acceptance of mrad and horizontal acceptance of mrad two silicon gratings with and mm line density are employed in the constant deviation configuration to produce monochromatic light with resolving power in the and ev energy ranges respectively the collimated beam is focused with second mirror onto vertical slits in the cm long gas filter from the source the gas filter has eight differentially pumped chambers the sixth chamber can be filled with mbar rare gas in order to filter out higher harmonics above ev mbar ne ar or above ev mbar ne without compromising the mbar background pressure in the transfer line for ev mgf window is used that absorbs virtually all light above ev above the ne ionization energy the beamline currently delivers light contaminated by higher harmonics up to ev the exit slit position is determined by the focus position and in order to obtain high differential pumping efficiency the rare gas pressure is largest where the apertures are the smallest e near the focus this means the beam either has to be refocused transferred by glass capillary in the ionization region or the ionization region has to be moved as close as possible to the focal point at present the latter two options are available and we typically operate with relatively large spot size of mm which makes alignment easier than when using capillary refocusing at the expense of half the photon flux would be beneficial if smaller than mm spot size were desired the light intensity was measured to be approximately depending on the photon energy this means that the light intensity e the ionization rate is several times that at the lyman line at with conventional hydrogen discharge lamp where coincidence data acquisition is typically impossible due to the high count rates however the high count rates are actually advantageous with the mm data acquisition technique continuous skimmed molecular beam it is only possible to produce energy selected ions if the parent initial internal energy the photon energy and the ionization energy are known if room temperature sample is used the initial thermal energy contributes to the parent ion internal energy and may shift the photon energy at which the fragment ion appears to lower energies which leads to the thermal shift moderate to large size molecules not only have significant internal energy and hard to describe coordinates of internal motion vibrations bordering on being hindered internal rotations to name one but also many degrees of freedom which can potentially reduce the rate constants thus lengthening the dissociation rates well beyond the tof range of the parent this results in the daughter ion appearing at higher energies than it would if the dissociation were fast this effect is called the kinetic shift thermal and kinetic shifts typically arise in the same molecules thereby complicating the accurate determination of dissociation energies the kinetic shift is inherent in statistical processes but the thermal shift can be decreased by cooling the sample therefore well pumped source chamber was constructed to enable continuous molecular beams in the normal h gas flow range as illustrated in fig the sample enters the source chamber through m diameter aperture in nozzle according to buckland et al the source chamber is pumped by l leybold coolvac cl cryopump and l pfeiffer tph up turbomolecular pump coolvac cl has normal liter capacity for ar which is equivalent to at least two weeks of uninterrupted operation the sample enters the experimental chamber through the mm opening of beam dynamics skimmer is ionized and pumped by l leybold coolvac cl cryopump and l pfeiffer tmh yp turbomolecular pump the turbomolecular pumps are backed by an adixen acp series roots pump and the cryopumps are driven by leybold coolpak compressor unit and backed by an adixen acp series roots pump the total high vacuum pumping capacity of s backed with an oil free foreline system provides clean vacuum system that minimizes the background when dealing with low density samples entrained in the molecular beam to maximize the molecular beam gas density at the ionization region the skimmer has to be close to the ionization spot this also means that the electrodes that extract the electrons and ions should have as small diameter as possible consistent with minimizing field penetration the other design criterion is that the source and the ionization chambers should be separated by valve in order to enable regeneration of the cryopump without flushing the source chamber or venting the ionization chamber without having to regenerate the coolvac cl cryopump commercial dn valves are too thick and would place the skimmer too far from the ionization spot the slim valves proposed by chaban and reutt robey stolow and pper et al were all designed for high vacuum conditions and have only two states open through skimmer and closed our vacuum criteria are looser but we also wanted third open setting so that the molecular beam source can easily be converted into an effusive source the clockwork valve developed in the machine shop at the paul scherrer institut and shown in fig has dial with six possible positions in its current configuration two of the positions are used for skimmers three are closed positions and fourth is fully open detailed dimensions for the valve are available the skimmer is optically accessible directly through two dn windows and obliquely through dn window on the source chamber the valve protrudes slightly into the ionization chamber and the skimmer base to flange distance reported by pper et al to be mm in their design is only mm in ours albeit the skimmer base to valve end distance is mm the seal is provided by an ring against which the dial is pressed every time it is in position ring tear so far appears to be less of an issue than had been feared the skimmer has no mechanically fixed position and must be optimized together with the nozzle in mm range to maximize the molecular beam light beam overlap the electrons and ions are accelerated from ground in v cm field between two plates with mm openings separated by mm the electrons fly vertically into the mm long electron flight tube with mm opening which serves to velocity image the beam at the mm diameter roentdek dld delay line detector with resistance matched photonics microchannel plates mcps mounted in chevron configuration det pore size biased at from the front plate since relatively low extraction field is needed to ensure high residence times of the ions in the acceleration region to measure dissociation rate constants we opted to keep the velocity imaging optics simple and have not included magnifying lens to allow for higher fields electrons with zero transverse momentum are focused to less than mm diameter spot at the center of the detector the center spot of zero kinetic energy electron image is shown in fig the photon energy was decreased to approximately mev below the ar ie to obtain pure threshold electron signal taking into account the photon energy resolution and the stark shift the spot full width at half maximum fwhm is mm and the radial distribution function drops to half its maximum at mm which corresponds to mev electron kinetic energy this spot size is significantly larger than the mcp channel to channel distance or the theoretical limit of the spatial resolution of the delay line which has been shown to be practical limits to the spatial resolution thus it is determined by the quality of the velocity imaging optics just as was observed by janssen and co workers for ion imaging in their femtosecond coincidence apparatus the kinetic energy electron contamination of the threshold signal at the center of the image can be subtracted based on the average count rate in surrounding ring area this approach is guaranteed not to produce artifacts such as the concentration of the noise along central axis encountered in the inverse abel transformation as long as the photon energy resolution is commensurate with the expected electron kinetic energy in the ring area there are two advantages to using the threshold electron signal first threshold electrons are focused onto the smallest area which improves the n ratio at energies where most electrons are highly energetic and the background in the electron image is high and almost constant second electrons are focused onto sphere not uniformly in the detector plane which means that focusing conditions will only be ideal for given kinetic energy additionally because of the e dependence of the ring radius on the kinetic energy even constant focusing would entail deteriorating absolute energy resolution at higher kinetic energies the kinetic energy range imaged at the detector depends on the focusing and the flight tube voltages at flight tube potential of electrons with approximately mev kinetic energy moving perpendicular to the flight axis are imaged at the rim of the active area of the detector at mm radius cm extraction field the energy range can be changed by scaling the extraction field and the corresponding flight tube potential the electron image shown in fig was obtained with the flight tube at v cm extraction field displays the autoionizing peak of ar at ev mev electrons and also shows autoionization from resulting in electrons with mev more kinetic energy this is the two dimensional projection of the three dimensional electron velocity distribution e the raw image and only higher limit to the fwhm of the two peaks is given based on their half width at half maximum on the high side which are and mm respectively corresponding to at least and mev electron energy resolutions at and mm off center on the detector the total active range of the detector corresponds to mev in this case eke is estimated to be at most and for the two peaks respectively worse than the smallest value reported by neumark and co workers or the by janssen and co workers our target function in the center over the energy range of the detector is on the other hand better than f better than for the neumark setup see fig in ref two metal pieces one encapsulating the whole electrode stack and the second one acting as the electron flight tube itself provide magnetic shielding for the electrons the magnetic shielding is incomplete at the electron detector side but stray fields entering the electron flight tube through its opening do not seem to affect the image quality the second ion plate located mm from the ionization spot has mm opening and is cut in two half moon sections so that potential difference can be applied orthogonal to the ion extraction axis parallel with the molecular beam axis this transverse field enables us to correct the lateral offset of the ions at the detector caused by the initial transverse velocity in the molecular beam s for the case of room temperature argon as backing gas and can increase the ion collection efficiency however this only becomes important at longer flight times in excess of i a mm transverse path at the mm diameter jordan mcp detector after having flown mm in the constant acceleration field the ions are accelerated to in the case of cm extraction field within space of mm ca mm long field free section follows at the end of which they are detected the second half of the field free drift region consists of plates to each of which different voltage can be applied it is thus possible to decelerate ions and introduce second field free drift region at lower potential which can be used to distinguish daughter ions formed in slow dissociation reactions in the first field free region data acquisition recording all detector events e all detected electrons and ions not only shortens the acquisition time in continuous two particle experiments but also has two more advantages it simplifies the false coincidence background subtraction and makes it possible to measure at arbitrarily high count rates from the point of view of data analysis and signal to noise ratio tof acquisition schemes can be categorized as ss sm or mm conventional data acquisition techniques have been based on an ss ref or an sm refs and scheme however in the high count rate environment of synchrotron it is essential to collect all starts and all stops in order to prevent paralysis of either the electron or the ion signal we designed such system based on master clock that is used to time all detector events and correlate them in real time the tdc hp system by roentdek consisting of the hptdc acquisition card by cronologic ohg built on the cern hptdc chip supports measurements of up to without trigger logic to the best of our knowledge this mode had not been realized before in coincidence experiments the interface to the hptdc driver had to be rewritten in order to drive the acquisition card in the raw mode in which all events are recorded and registered by software hits x y and mcp signals from the electron detector and ion hits from the ion detector have time stamps but are not necessarily read out in chronological order therefore the events need to be ordered on the fly the two and the two signals from the roentdek detector are correlated in order to get the time stamp and the position information of the electron electron hits then need to be correlated with all ion signals multiple stop within the tof range irrespective of the readout sequence of the hits relevant sections of the microsoft visual code that interfaces between the hptdc driver and the measurement user interface written in delphi are available for download the user interface was also integrated in the epics beamline control system which enables continuous monitoring of the voltages pressures and fully automated data acquisition threshold photoelectron spectrum of the threshold photoelectron spectrum tpes of the argon dimer was recorded in the ev energy range ar was prepared in molecular beam using m nozzle at bar ar backing pressure the pressures in the source and experimental chambers were and mbar respectively the collection efficiencies for the electrons and ions were calculated at the ar edge at ev using nc ni and nc ne where and are the electron and ion collection efficiencies and ne ni and nc are the measured electron ion and coincidence counts respectively the photon energies were calibrated with the autoionization peaks of ar ev and ev and ne ev and ev by using the second harmonic radiation at half the ne autoionization energies and the xe line ev the photon energy resolution was measured to be mev using the autoionization peak widths the ar tpes and the photoionization efficiency curve for ar are shown in fig the tpes can be collected with or without coincidence with mass selected ar ions there is little difference between the two spectra except for the slightly worse signal to noise for the mass selected one which shows that g ar trimers are not formed and do not contribute to the tpes signal however for samples that consist of mixture of various species that ionize in the same photon energy range the tpes in coincidence with mass analyzed ions provides route for collecting clean spectra the peak positions and intensities agree well with the high resolution study of signorell and merkt although our resolution is far from theirs cm e ev the total measurement time with our setup amounted to less than day which is an appealingly short time for spectral survey finally as the photoelectron spectrum from to mev and the angular electron distributions are always recorded it will also be possible to use these data to look at autoionizing states and determine their final ion state atom loss from the ipepico setup was tested on the small methane molecule that dissociates rapidly on the time scale of the ion tof both effusive and molecular beam sample sources were used the room temperature breakdown diagram which is plot of the fractional abundance of the parent and fragment ion signals as function of the photon energy is available as electronic supplemental material the slowly descending parent ion signal and the corresponding ascending methyl ion signal is result of the thermal rotational distribution of the sample at cl atom loss from stevens et al measured and modeled the dissociation rates of halogen atom loss from halobenzenes over wide internal energy range we used h cl seeded in bar ar with m nozzle in the molecular beam source to reproduce their results and measure the temperature of the sample in the molecular beam the optimized breakdown diagram assuming sample temperature of and yielding best fit rrkm barrier of ev is shown in fig the breakdown diagram and the tof distributions were fit using the reported e function and only the internal temperature of chlorobenzene in the molecular beam and the barrier to dissociation were varied as shown in the insert of fig the statistical goodness of fit short dashed lines of the model to the tof distributions which are shown in the electronic supplemental material did not vary with the assumed temperature however the goodness of the fit long dashed lines for the breakdown diagram began to increase the fit became worse above temperature of this suggests that the sample temperature is below at which temperature the sample contains only kj mol mev of rovibrational energy compared to room temperature average energy of mev the insensitivity of the breakdown diagram to temperature below is because the major broadening of the breakdown diagram is result of the slow dissociation rates in view of previously published studies on the cooling of vibrations in continuous molecular beams temperature around is not unreasonable and the total temperature range only translates into kj mol uncertainty in the barrier height the measured and calculated tof distributions see ref agree very well which corroborates the reported e curve as well as our ability to measure slow dissociation rates the imaging pepico originally proposed by szt ray and baer in has been designed and built at the paul scherrer institut and is now operational at the vuv beamline of the swiss light source the main benefits of the experiment in comparison with the one described in ref include mev electron kinetic energy resolution in continuous experiment simultaneous electron kinetic energy analysis in the mev range the use of tunable synchrotron radiation up to ev photon energy and large throughput pump system to allow for continuous supersonic molecular beam successful applications of the ipepico setup described in this paper cover tpes argon dimer accurate appearance energies by means of tpepico atom loss from methane and measurement of slow rate constant in photoionization photodissociation processes of large molecules cl atom loss from chlorobenzene  perovskite ch nh pbi light absorber is deposited on the mesoporous tio layer via one step and two step coating methods and their photovoltaic performances are compared one step coating using solution containing ch nh and pbi shows average power conversion efficiency pce of while higher average pce of is obtained from two step coating method mainly due to higher voltage and fill factor the coverage pore filling and morphology of the deposited perovskite are found to be critical in photovoltaic performance of the mesoporous tio based perovskite solar cells perovskite solar cell is emerging photovoltaic technology because of low cost and high efficiency since the reports on the all solid state perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiencies pces of in rapid progress has been made for the past one and half years as consequence pces as high as over have been achieved ch nh pbi and ch nh pbi xclx are currently the front and center materials for high efficiency perovskite solar cell since perovskite was first used as sensitizer in dye sensitized type solar cell in the early stage perovskite has been tried to be deposited on the surface of tio spin coating of the solutions containing ch nh and pbi for ch nh pbi or ch nh and pbcl for ch nh pbi xclx led to the scattered nanodots or extremely thin layer this method requires infiltration of hole transporting material htm such as tetrakis n di methoxyphenylamine spirobifluorene spiro meotad into the pores of the metal oxide films photovoltaic performance relies significantly on the extent of pore filling with htm this issue was addressed by filling the pores with perovskite instead of htm which resulted in pce of building up the perovskite thin layer in the mesoporous metal oxide matrix nanocomposite structure eventually led to construction of heterojunction structure without the metal oxide layer recent progress in perovskite solar cell and its basic understanding can be found in the latest literatures for pore filling with ch nh pbi perovskite sequential deposition technique via two step dipping was found to one of effective ways to achieve reproducibly high efficiency perovskite solar cell average pce of with small standard deviation of was obtained using two step dipping method slight modification of dipping condition led to pce of it was mentioned that uncontrolled precipitation of ch nh pbi perovskite in single step deposition produced large morphological variation and thereby inconsistent photovoltaic performance however no comparative study between the one step and two step deposition has been carried out here we have studied morphology and photovoltaic performance depending on deposition procedure of ch nh pbi we performed two step sequential spin coating procedure for ch nh pbi deposition which was slightly different from two step dipping method both one step and two step coating methods resulted in reproducible photovoltaic performance but significant difference in especially photovoltage and fill factor electron life time was dependent on coating procedure such difference in photovoltaic performance was found to correlate to morphology of the deposited ch nh pbi ch nh was synthesized according to method reported in ref methylamine ml in methanol tci and hydroiodic acid ml wt in water aldrich were mixed at and stirred for the precipitate

then dried at for min it took to reach rpm the duration for acceleration the htm and au layer were formed by the same way in the one step coating procedure photocurrent and voltage were measured from solar simulator equipped with xenon lamp newport ns and keithley source meter light intensity was adjusted with the nrel calibrated si solar cell having kg filter for approximating one sun light intensity mw cm while measuring current and voltage the cell was covered with black mask having an aperture incident photon to electron conversion efficiency ipce was measured using specially designed

calibrated photodiode as standard ipce data were collected at dc mode field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jeol jsm was used to investigate surface and cross sectional morphology of the perovskite solar cells for transient photovoltage measurement nm and nm of wavelength lasers were used as probe and bias light source respectively the probe light was incident over the bias light generating steady state charge where the incident charge was rapidly decreased showing first order exponential decay both light intensities were varied by neutral density filter the transient photovoltage signal was amplified using low noise preamplifier stanford research system sr and monitored by an oscilloscope tds impedance spectra were measured in dark with an autolab with varying bias potential from to where the potential step is ac mv perturbation was applied with frequency from mhz to hz the resulted impedance spectra were fit using view software the nyquist plots and the best fit results figure of the supplementary material based on an equivalent circuit were described in the supplementary material in figure one step and two step coating procedures are schematically illustrated for one step coating of ch nh pbi the dma solution containing equimolar ch nh and pbi is spin coated on the mesoporous tio layer pbi is formed first for two step coating procedure which was followed by spin coating the ch nh solution in two step procedure compared to two step dipping method two step spin coating procedure is well defined method because of quantitatively managed process the amount of ch nh and spin coating condition should be carefully adjusted in terms of the amount of deposited pbi for coating with of pbi solution of ch nh is found to be sufficient to convert pbi into ch nh pbi as confirmed by no presence of pbi peak in ray diffraction spectrum data are not shown detailed method for two step coating is described in the experimental part as can be seen in sem images in figure morphology of the deposited ch nh pbi is remarkably different one step coating produces shapeless ch nh pbi figure whereas cube like crystals are formed by two step coating method figure besides morphological difference tio layer is not completely covered by the perovskite using one step spin coating method compared to full coverage with perovskite by two step coating procedure insufficient coverage in one step coating is probably related to wettability associated with high ionic strength of ch nh and pb and of of coating solution and or competition between positive ions of ch nh and pb contrary to one step method close packing with cube like crystal with dimension of about nm is induced by two step method which indicates that spin coating of of solution of pbi in dmf covers fully the tio film pbi is layered structure and well known to undergo intercalation reaction in which lewis base molecules such as pyridine and methylamine were found to be intercalated into interlayer of pbi it was mentioned that charge transfer was not obvious during intercalation reaction and the dipole moment of lewis base molecule or hydrogen bonding by the h bond was necessary requirement for intercalation thus reaction of pbi with ch nh may be regarded as pseudo intercalation because in ch nh salt acts as an electron donor reaction of pbi with forms presumably pbi via i interaction which is followed by reaction with ch nh to form ch nh pbi it was reported that vacuum deposited pbi was converted to ch nh pbi when it was dipped in ch nh solution where full conversion required more than however solution processed pbi film reduces significantly reaction time for conversion according to single crystal ray diffraction analysis need like crystals collected after cooling solution of pbi in dmf revealed that one dmf molecule was coordinated to pb via oxygen bridge thus substitution of ch nh for dmf could also explain the two step formation of ch nh pbi and the faster reaction than the vacuum deposited pbi beginning with surface reaction investigation from cross sectional sem images also confirms imperfect pore filling of perovskite by one step coating which leads to contact between fto and htm as can be seen in figure on the other hand pores are completely filled with perovskite by using two step coating as can be seen in schematic illustrations based on sem images one step coating leads to perovskite island but two step one results in void free perovskite layer mesoporous tio layer thickness is about nm and perovskite overlayer is around nm photovoltaic parameters are plotted in figure where the data obtained from cells are statistically analyzed all the parameters of two step deposited perovskite are superior to those of one step deposited one average short circuit current density jsc open circuit voltage voc fill factor ff and power conversion efficiency pce of ma cm and are observed from the one step deposited perovskite solar cells while higher values of ma cm and are obtained from the two step deposited ones standard deviation for pce is as small as and for the one step and two step deposited devices respectively which indicates that the data are reproducible morphology property relation can explain difference in photovoltaic performance higher jsc for the two step deposition is due to better pore filling of perovskite compared to its island structure for the one step deposition as shown in figure the absence of perovskite at fto interface loses absorption of short wavelength light as firmed by ipce measurement in figure which is responsible for lower jsc for one step deposition recombination kinetics of devices based on one step and two step procedure are investigated using transient photovoltage measurement and impedance spectra the electron life time is obtained from transient photovoltage signal by fitting it with first order exponential decay in the transient photovoltage measurement the electron life time is strongly dependent on the light intensity where strong light intensity induces high electron and hole density and thus fast recombination is resulted contrariwise longer electron life time is attributed to the lower density of electron and hole induced by weak light intensity it is reported that ch nh pbi perovskite solar cell also shows the power law dependence of electron life time on the light intensity or open circuit voltage as shown in figure the electron life time of two step deposited perovskite is about one order of magnitude longer than that of one step implying that the recombination kinetics highly depends on the perovskite structure determined by deposition method this suggests that the voids generated in one step coating allow htm to infiltrate into perovskite layer which increases potential recombination site and leads ten times faster recombination than in two step deposited perovskite the recombination resistance is obtained from impedance spectra where the first arc in high frequency region is related to the transport in sprio meotad and the second arc is related to the recombination the two arcs are fitted using simplified equivalent circuit resistance parallel resistance capacitance parallel resistance and capacitance in series and the resulted recombination resistance rr is plotted as function of an applied bias voltage in figure rr shows little change in the low applied voltage vapp region but it starts to decrease rapidly as the fermi level in photoanode increases by applying high bias voltage vapp rr for one step and two step deposited perovskite are similar as expected in the region of low applied voltage vapp but rr for one step shows lower value than that for two step as the applied bias voltage increases more than describing that the recombination kinetics for one step is faster than that of two step perovskite this result is also accordance with the tendency of electron life time likewise the two step perovskite shows enhanced recombination kinetics due to its well established layer with free void enabling to prevent the htm infiltration and thus decrease the recombination probability the lowered recombination rate for two step deposited perovskite layer has significant impact on the open circuit voltage leading mv higher voc than that for one step deposited perovskite it was reported that photovoltaic performance was found to be strongly dependent on degree of perovskite pore filling where decrease in perovskite pore filling fraction led to deterioration of jsc voc and fill factor in addition incomplete perovskite pore filling resulted in fast charge recombination of the injected electron in tio with spiro meotad thus we propose here that removal of the exposed tio allowing unwanted contact with spiro meotad is important to improve photovoltaic performance of the mesoporous tio based perovskite solar cell photovoltaic property morphology relation was systematically evaluated from the diverse deposition methodologies of perovskite ch nh pbi reproducible photovoltaic parameters extracted from statistical analysis were found to have strong correlation with the morphology of the deposited perovskite along with degree of the perovskite coverage recombination kinetics was significantly affected by the resulting morphology of the perovskite the exposed tio by one step coating was responsible for fast recombination and short electron life time on the other hand the complete pore filling with perovskite by two step method resulted in significant improvement of photovoltaic performance it is concluded that photovoltaic performance is strongly dependent on degree of perovskite coverage on the mesoporous tio layer and morphology of the deposited perovskite in the mesoporous tio based perovskite solar cells  hydropower is the largest renewable energy resource in the united states and the world however hydropower dams have adverse ecological impacts because migrating fish may be injured or killed when they pass through hydroturbines in the columbia and snake river basins dam operators and engineers are required to make those hydroelectric facilities more fish friendly through changes in hydroturbine design and operation after fish population declines and the subsequent listing of several species of pacific salmon under the endangered species act of public utility district no of grant county washington requested authorization from the federal energy regulatory commission to replace the ten turbines at wanapum dam with advanced hydropower turbines designed to improve survival for fish passing through the turbines while improving operation efficiency and increasing power generation as an additional measure to the primary metric of direct injury and mortality rates of juvenile chinook salmon using balloon tag recapture methodology this study used an autonomous sensor device the sensor fish to provide insight into the specific hydraulic conditions and physical stresses experienced by the fish as well as the specific causes of fish biological response we found that the new hydroturbine blade shape and the corresponding reduction of turbulence in the advanced hydropower turbine were effective in meeting the objectives of improving fish survival while enhancing operational efficiency of the dam the frequency of severe events based on sensor fish pressure and acceleration measurements showed trends similar to those of fish survival determined by the balloon tag recapture methodology in addition the new turbine provided better pressure and rate of pressure change environment for fish passage overall the sensor fish data indicated that the advanced hydroturbine design improved passage of juvenile salmon at wanapum dam hydropower is the world largest renewable energy resource accounting for more than of the global total renewable electric power capacity in the united states hydropower provides about of the total renewable electric generation and of the total electricity with the columbia and snake river basins contributing to of the nation total hydroelectric energy however hydropower dams may injure or kill fish that live in or migrate through impounded river systems several species of anadromous pacific salmon in the columbia and snake river basins are currently listed for protection under the endangered species act of consequently dam operators and engineers are required to make these hydroelectric facilities more fish friendly through changes in hydroturbine design and operation in the public utility district no of grant county washington grant pud requested authorization from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to replace the ten turbines at wanapum dam on the columbia river in washington state the existing kaplan type turbines have been in place for more than years and were reaching the end of their useful machine life grant pud proposed to replace the turbines with an advanced hydropower turbine aht design that would include features to improve survival for fish passing through the turbines while improving operation efficiency and increasing power generation from to mw major changes in the aht design to reduce adverse impacts to fish during turbine passage and improve hydraulic conditions included reshaped stay vanes improved alignment and reduced size of wicket gates runner with six blades the existing one has five blades discharge ring to eliminate gaps at the hub and discharge ring and reshaped draft tube to reduce turbulence major features of the aht design for improving operation efficiency and increasing power generation included larger turbine runner diameter greater hydraulic capacity and increased number of wicket gates fig one of these ahts was installed at wanapum dam turbine unit for testing in the first step in biological performance testing for the new aht was to compare fish passage and survival estimates and hydraulic conditions between the aht and existing conventional turbine designs based on this information decision would be made on whether to proceed with replacement of the remaining nine turbines with the new ahts the s department of energy office of energy efficiency and renewable energy provided cofunding to grant pud for aspects of performance testing that supported the ferc application the primary measure of biological performance for the application was direct injury and mortality rates of juvenile chinook salmon as determined by balloon tag recapture methodology randomized block experiment was conducted that included the two turbine types conventional and aht three intake bays two entrainment locations within each turbine and four discharge levels although balloon tag recapture field studies are used routinely to evaluate turbine biological performance they do not provide insight into the specific hydraulic conditions or physical stresses that the fish experience or the specific causes of the biological response to overcome this limitation an autonomous sensor device developed by pacific northwest national laboratory was released concurrently with balloon tagged live fish to measure hydraulic conditions such as pressure acceleration and rotation acting on the sensor body in situ during downstream passage the specific objectives of this study were to develop and apply methodology to classify sensor fish acceleration events and to analyze those events for general regions within the turbine system to statistically analyze sensor fish data together with live fish biological response data and to use sensor fish data to assess whether the aht design features led to improved biological performance wanapum dam is within the priest rapids project and is located in central washington state on the columbia river at river kilometer rkm fig it consists of m ten turbine powerhouse m bay spillway and nonoverflow earth fill section columbia river average discharge at this location is approximately s sensor the sensor fish fig is an autonomous device developed at pacific northwest national laboratory for the s department of energy and the s army corps of engineers to better understand the physical conditions fish experience during passage through hydroturbines spillways and other dam bypass alternatives it measures the three dimensional linear acceleration and three dimensional angular velocities plus pressure and temperature at sampling frequency of hz the sensor fish device is mm in diameter and mm in length weighs comparable to yearling salmon smolt and is nearly neutrally buoyant in fresh water sensor fish devices deployed for such studies are tested in calibration apparatus prior to deployment the relative errors of both the linear acceleration and angular velocity measurements are consistently less than the sensor fish has been used extensively in both laboratory environments and hydroelectric dam field environments to correlate with fish injury and provide information on severe hydraulic conditions the existing turbine at wanapum dam unit was selected as the conventional turbine to compare with the new aht at unit passage conditions treatments consisted of combinations of factors including turbine discharge the intake bay and release depth entrainment depth in both turbines sensor fish were injected at the centerline of each of three intake bays and at two elevations and termed shallow and deep releases respectively at the same horizontal locations fig the two release pipe elevations were and lower than the turbine ceiling elevation the consideration of elevation prior to turbine runner passage is critical because previous turbine biological assessments have found that the elevation of entry influences the turbine passage route for kaplan turbines fish passing lower through the wicket gates will pass nearer the runner blade tips while those passing higher through the wicket gates will pass nearer to the runner hub assuming fish follow the flow streamlines mortality rates for fish are significantly higher for fish that pass near the blade tips than for those that pass midblade and near the runner hub all sensor fish releases were interspersed with the balloon tagged fish being evaluated in separate study conducted by normandeau associates inc four discharge conditions and s were evaluated for each turbine in addition to maximum discharge condition of s for the aht total of sensor fish was released pressure measurements were used to estimate the depth and location of the sensor fish device for both the conventional turbine and aht general distinctive features were associated with passage locations including the time of passage from the injection pipe exit into the turbine intake through the stay vane wicket gate cascade through the runner and runner wake and through the draft tube fig when sensor fish contact solid structures or are impacted by turbulent shear high amplitude impulses occur in the acceleration and rotational velocity time history if the acceleration reaches certain threshold the exposure is counted as an exposure event based on previous laboratory studies the event is further categorized into three levels according to the acceleration magnitude severe if g medium if a and slight if a the identification of an event as collision or shear is based on the characteristics of acceleration during the exposure event peak duration was defined as the duration of acceleration within of the peak value and used as the criterion to distinguish collision from shear the exposure event is collision event when peak duration is less than and the event is shear event when peak duration is longer than standard deviations of the probabilities of collisions or shear events were derived using the bootstrapping method in addition to injury from collisions and shear fish may be injured or killed by exposure to rapid changes in pressure during turbine passage the magnitude and rate of change in pressure are greatest during passage from the wicket gates to exit of the runner the lowest pressures nadir pressure are observed on the underside or suction side of turbine blades while the highest are observed on the upper surface of the blades changes in the operating geometry of turbine as well as the design of runner blades and other turbine elements also affect the magnitude and distribution of pressure in turbine to account for the complexity of the pressure environment we computed the range and median of nadir total pressure for each treatment and rate of pressure change the magnitude of pressure change was computed from the pressure measurements obtained by sensors as they were carried in flow from the wicket gates through the nadir around the turbine runner the pressure rate of change was then estimated by dividing the pressure change measurement by the corresponding travel time severe exposure events were primarily collisions of the total releases there were severe collision events compared to severe shear events when all discharges and release elevations are combined the number of severe events in the stay vane wicket gate and draft tube regions was effectively the same for both turbines fig the new aht at unit had lower probability of severe events in the runner region compared to those at the conventional turbine at unit however due to small sample size there were no clear trends when the data were examined by discharge and release elevation in the intake region for both turbines there were only very few slight events six collisions and one shear there were no severe or medium events in the stay vane wicket gate region the aht had slightly higher probability of severe collision than the conventional turbine both turbines had very few severe shear events and respectively but the aht had more slight shear events than the conventional turbine in the runner region the conventional turbine had more severe collision events and more severe shear events than the aht for severe collision and for shear in the draft tube region there were very few slight shear events total of four and no severe or medium shear events for both units in addition the percentage of severe collisions was almost identical for the aht and the conventional turbine in this region when all four regions were pooled together fig the two turbines had almost identical probability of severe collisions at and even though the aht had six blade runner while the conventional turbine had five blade runner in addition the probabilities for both medium and slight collisions were similar for both turbines the aht had fewer severe shear events than the conventional turbine but the aht had more slight shear events than the conventional turbine possibly due to the addition of more wicket gates to the aht e compared to for the conventional turbine there was no statistical evidence to suggest significant difference in severe or medium events for these two turbines with all shear and collision combined however the aht produced slightly lower probability of severe events than unit for both turbines the sensor fish device released from the deep location elevation experienced significantly higher probability of severe or medium event than those from shallow releases fig this finding is consistent with the results of the live fish study showing that fish from deep releases had significantly lower survival rates that those from shallow releases recent research using simulated turbine passage pressure exposure indicates that factors such as nadir pressure the depth acclimation history of fish and their state of buoyancy prior to turbine entry significantly affect rates of injury and mortality median nadir total pressure and range measured by the sensor fish device decreased with discharge for both turbine units fig the new aht showed higher nadir values and narrower range than the conventional turbine the difference in median nadir pressure was consistent at approximately kpa for all discharges however the lowest nadir pressures observed for the new turbine were approximately kpa higher than those for the existing design turbine at the highest discharges tested the magnitude of pressure change from the turbine wicket gate through the runner exit was found to be consistently higher across discharge for both turbines for deep releases fig the new aht had smaller pressure change than the conventional turbine at the same release depth however the mean values for the shallow releases for the conventional turbine were lower or similar to those for the aht deep releases the highest rates of change were observed for the deep releases for the conventional turbine the lowest pressure changes were observed for the shallow releases for the aht the average pressure rate of change steadily increased with discharge for both test turbines fig trends similar to those observed for the magnitude of change in pressure were evident in the rate of change observations as well the highest average rates of change were observed for the deep releases in the conventional turbine unit the lowest rates of change were observed for the shallow releases in the new aht comparison of sensor there were fewer severe events for shallow versus deep releases which was reflected in fish survival rates table the overall rates of severe events for each turbine were similar although the aht had slightly fewer events than the conventional turbine this trend was not reflected in the live fish survival rate where the aht had slightly lower survival rate than the conventional turbine however the differences were not significant the survival rates were only the direct effects of turbine passage from the turbine system fish were recovered immediately after they passed through the dam and held for fish injuries due to predation were excluded when estimating the injury rates due to the turbine environment indirect mortality that may occur at later time as result of passage through the hydrosystem was not considered either overall the results could not reject the primary hypothesis that fish survival rate through the new aht is equal or better than that through the original turbine although the aht at unit had six blade runner it showed reduced rate of severe collisions compared to the five blade runner of the conventional turbine at unit severe shear events were also fewer in the aht these results suggested that the new blade shape and the corresponding reduction turbulence in the aht were effective in meeting the objectives of improving fish survival while enhancing operational efficiency and increasing power generation the draft tube in the aht was also modified to improve hydraulic conditions however sensor fish results did not show significant difference in severe events between the two turbines that corresponded to passage through this region the frequency of severe events based on sensor fish pressure and acceleration measurements showed similar trends to fish survival determined by balloon tag tests this trend was consistent within each turbine unit and by entrainment depth in addition the new aht turbine provided better pressure and rate of opressure change environment for fish passage overall the sensor fish data indicated that the aht design improved the passage of juvenile salmon at wanapum dam the federal energy regulatory commission approved the relicensing application of wanapum dam by grant pud and the remaining nine turbine units are being replaced with the aht turbines and will be completed by  perovskite is promising light harvester for use in photovoltaic solar cells in recent years the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has been dramatically increased making them competitive source of renewable energy an important parameter when designing high efficiency perovskite based solar cells is the perovskite deposition which must be performed to create complete coverage and optimal film thickness this paper describes an in depth study on two step deposition separating the perovskite deposition into two precursors the effects of spin velocity annealing temperature dipping time and methylammonium iodide concentration on the photovoltaic performance are studied observations include that current density is affected by changing the spin velocity while the fill factor changes mainly due to the dipping time and methylammonium iodide concentration interestingly the open circuit voltage is almost unaffected by these parameters hole conductor free perovskite solar cells are used in this work in order to minimize other possible effects this study provides better understanding and control over the perovskite deposition through highly efficient low cost perovskite based solar cells in recent years organo metal perovskite has been used as light harvester in solar cells the high efficiency perovskite based solar cells are simple to fabricate and low cost making them competitive source of renewable energy kojima et al were the first to use solution processed methylammonium ma lead halide iodide ch nh pbi perovskite as sensitizer on mesostructured tio using liquid electrolyte achieving power conversion efficiency pce of however these cells suffered from major stability issues the use of solid hole conductor material in ch nh pbi perovskite solar cells demonstrated pce of with much better stability recently pces of more than were demonstrated for perovskite based solar cells substitution of the iodide with chloride achieved mapbi clx perovskites which were deposited on mesoscopic tio and al achieving pces of and respectively one of the attractive properties of the perovskites is their ability to act both as light harvester and hole conductor with low exciton binding energy making the fabrication of solar cells based on these perovskites much simpler compared to organic photovoltaic opvs or dye sensitized solar cells dsscs moreover the structure of perovskite solar cells is not restricted to mesoporous structure and efficient planar perovskite solar cells have been demonstrated as well several deposition techniques are used for perovskite based solar cells including vapor deposition vapor assisted solution process vasp and solution processed via one step and two step deposition the effect of the perovskite deposition on the solar cells performance is critically important it determines the film coverage film thickness film quality and the transport properties graetzel and co workers have demonstrated the use of the two step deposition technique as powerful technique for achieving highly efficient perovskite solar cells the two step deposition enables better control over the perovskite crystallization by separating the perovskite deposition into the two precursors this paper describes an in depth study of the parameters influencing the two step deposition of perovskite in the solar cell hole conductor free perovskite solar cells were fabricated in this work in order to minimize other possible effects the influence of spin velocity dipping time annealing temperature and methylammonium iodide mai concentration on the photovoltaic pv performance are investigated this study provides further understanding and control over the perovskite deposition through highly efficient perovskite based solar cells this paper discusses the study of different parameters influencing the two step deposition of ch nh pbi perovskite in photovoltaic solar cells the perovskite solar cell structure discussed is presented in figure ch nh pbi functions both as light harvester and hole transport material as discussed elsewhere this dual function simplifies the cell structure and minimizes the effect of other parameters that influence the pv performance such as inconsistency in pore filling by the hole conductor two step deposition includes several stages dropping the pbi solution onto the tio electrode spin coating the pbi and heating the pbi dipping the pbi electrode into ch nh ch nh mai solution annealing of the ch nh pbi perovskite figure shows the different stages in the deposition process this paper describes changes in several important parameters in the deposition of the perovskite showing the influence of these parameters on morphology optical properties and photovoltaic performance pbi synthesis the first step in the two step deposition technique includes the pbi precursor not much attention has been devoted to the synthesis of the pbi usually this precursor is purchased from supplier in this study the pbi was synthesized in the lab according to reaction documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation rm pb left rm no rm right rm rm ki to rm pbi rm rm rm no rm rm end equation end document pb no ki pbi no the pb no was reacted with potassium iodide ki at ratio of in water at the pbi was precipitated immediately filtered and dried in vacuum oven ray diffraction xrd analysis was performed on the synthesized pbi and on pbi purchased from sigma aldrich figure shows xrd of the lab synthesized pbi and of the purchased pbi there is complete agreement between both spectra indicating that the pbi synthesized in the lab is the same as the standard purchased pbi ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis also confirmed that there is no difference between the two versions of pbi for xps spectra please see table and figure in the supplementary material figure presents high resolution scanning electron microscopy hr sem of the synthesized pbi deposited on mesoporous tio spin velocity the influence of spin velocity on pv performance was examined by changing the spin velocity of the pbi on the tio film process in figure figure presents top view hr sem of the ch nh pbi at different spin velocities the dipping time related to process in figure discussed in the section dipping time was the same for all spin velocities it is seen that for rpm the coverage of the ch nh pbi is not complete there are several voids when the spin velocity is increased the pbi film is more uniform than when the spin velocity is low low rpm as seen at rpm rpm and rpm the ch nh pbi crystals increase in size with increased spin velocity the reason for that is related to the dipping time in the ch nh solution process in figure as indicated in the previous paragraph the dipping time in this set of experiments was the same at rpm the pbi film is thicker than at rpm while the thinnest pbi film was observed at rpm different film thickness requires different dipping times however when the dipping time is the same the resulting crystals size is dependent on the spin velocity film thickness therefore in the case of rpm the thinnest pbi film thickness the perovskite crystals were the biggest the difference in the film thickness of the pbi and ch nh pbi is supported by the absorbance spectra in figure two different spin velocities are presented rpm and rpm in the case of the absorbance of pbi there is big difference between the samples related to thicker film of pbi at rpm in the case of the absorbance of ch nh pbi the difference between the spin velocities can be observed although it is lower than the difference between the pbi samples the explanation is related to the fact that the film thickness of the complete ch nh pbi is also dependent on the dipping process of the pbi electrode which affected the final film thickness of the perovskite table and figure summarize the pv parameters and the current voltage curves jv curves of the cells at different spin velocities the best pv results are achieved for the rpm sample with pce of the data show that by changing the spin velocity the current density of the solar cell is the parameter with the most influence dipping time the effect of dipping time in the ch nh solution process in figure on morphology and on pv performance was studied figure presents dipping times of min min and it is noted that increasing the dipping time increases the size of the ch nh pbi perovskite crystals spin velocity was the same for all samples in these experiments resulting in perovskite crystals the size of several micrometers the influence of dipping on pv performance is observed in table ii and figure the best pv performance was observed for the shortest dipping time of longer dipping time results in bigger crystals which affect transport through the perovskite film and enhance the recombination at longer dipping times as indicated by the dark current measurements in figure the open circuit voltage voc and fill factors ff were lower for dipping times of and for compared to the other dipping times annealing temperature the annealing step is the final stage before evaporation of the contact as indicated previously no hole transport material is used in these cells to investigate the effect of the annealing temperature several annealing temperatures were studied figure presents hr sem micrographs of four annealing temperatures c and at annealing temperature the ch nh pbi perovskite crystals are separate from each other when increasing the annealing temperature to some of the perovskite crystals are sintered together while at annealing temperature most of the perovskite crystals are sintered and there are no separate crystals of perovskite at the surface at annealing temperature the ch nh pbi perovskite crystals are melted resulting in the lowest power conversion efficiency the pv performance and the current voltage curves of the different annealing temperatures are presented in table iii and figure the best photovoltaic performance was achieved at an annealing temperature of and the highest current density was observed at this annealing temperature probably result of better sintering of the ch nh pbi perovskite crystals than at the lower temperatures c and figure summarizes the influence of the annealing temperature on the current density and the efficiency of the hole conductor free solar cells obviously the annealing temperature mainly influences the current density methylammonium iodide concentration the concentration of mai in the dipping solution has an important effect on the cells performance process in figure increasing the mai concentration results in more mai to react with the already deposited pbi which could increase the crystallization of the ch nh pbi perovskite however when an excess of mai is present in the dipping solution the free mai which did not react with the pbi could have the opposite effect the excess mai might remain on the ch nh pbi perovskite surface reducing the perovskite conductivity moreover excess mai could cause desorption of the perovskite from the surface table iv shows the pv parameters at different mai concentrations in the dipping solution at high mai concentration the pv performance decreases due to decrease in the current density for low mai concentration the current density is high although the ff is lower than the mai table iv shows that there is an optimum concentration where the ff and the current density are the highest resulting in pce of the highest efficiency in this study above this optimum point both fill factor and efficiency decreased due to an excess of mai in the dipping solution figure current voltage curves and internal quantum efficiency iqe graphs are presented in figures and respectively iqe is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of given energy that is absorbed by the cell the iqe spectra of the mai concentration achieved around in the range of nm in this research the two step deposition technique was used for the deposition of the ch nh pbi in hole conductor free perovskite solar cells the elimination of hole conductor in this study enabled isolating the effect of different parameters in the two step deposition process and to investigate their influence on the pv performance pbi was synthesized in the lab avoiding contamination and non desirable additives the effect on the photovoltaic performance was investigated by changing several parameters in the two step deposition e spin velocity dipping time annealing temperature and various methylammonium iodide concentrations it was concluded that the spin velocity has the most influence on the jsc dipping time on the ff annealing temperature on the jsc and mai concentration on the ff and jsc interestingly the voc was almost not affected by these parameters understanding the effect of these critical parameters on perovskite deposition could lead to highly efficient low cost perovskite based solar cells  organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells arguably represent the most auspicious new photovoltaic technology so far as they possess an astonishing combination of properties the impressive and brisk advances achieved so far bring forth highly efficient and solution processable solar cells holding great promise to grow into mature technology that is ready to be embedded on large scale however the vast majority of state of the art perovskite solar cells contains dense tio electron collection layer that requires high temperature treatment which obstructs the road towards roll to roll processing on flexible foils that can withstand no more than furthermore this high temperature treatment leads to an overall increased energy payback time and cumulative energy demand for this emerging photovoltaic technology here we present the implementation of an alternative tio layer formed from an easily prepared nanoparticle dispersion with annealing needs well within reach of roll to roll processing making this technology also appealing from the energy payback aspect chemical and morphological analysis allows to understand and optimize the processing conditions of the tio layer finally resulting in maximum obtained efficiency of for planar heterojunction solar cell within an ito tio ch nh pbi xclxpoly hexylthiophene ag architecture since the first reports on hybrid solar cells based on organolead trihalide perovskites these materials have thoroughly engrossed the photovoltaic community already from the birth of this new class of solar cells high photon to electron conversion efficiencies have been reported for cells containing either ch nh pbi or ch nh pbi xclx thereby almost immediately overtaking the record efficiencies of organic solar cells and dye sensitized solar cells and leading up to current world record of in matter of only few years this fast paced progress to such high efficiencies announces this new technology as true potential rival for si based photovoltaics in first instance the perovskite was regarded as new kind of dye that could boost the efficiency of dye sensitized solar cells the dye is grafted onto porous metal oxide structure to optimize light absorption and simultaneously guarantee favorable charge transport therefore and in unawareness of its true capabilities the perovskite solar cell concept initially often inherited the porous metal oxide structure which at the same time would be ostensibly required to guarantee sufficiently large area for exciton dissociation however not much later it was discovered that the typical three dimensional organolead trihalide perovskites exhibit very high charge carrier diffusion lengths especially for the mixed halide with cl up to and low exciton binding energy mev while having very high absorption coefficient and charge carrier mobility moreover it has been shown that the perovskite actually functions as the ambipolar layer in p n junction the combination of these observations raises serious doubts regarding the necessity of the well established porous metal oxide matrix in perovskite based solar cells even though there are many high efficiencies reported based on mesoporous tio indeed several groups pointed out that simpler device architecture where perovskite layer is sandwiched between selective contacts is able to deliver comparable or even better performance than mesoporous tio perovskite compound efficiencies of around were obtained for solution processed planar heterojunction ch nh pbi xclx based solar cells and even up to by vapor deposition in the latter cases the compact tio layer was deposited by heating precursor gel at high temperature lacking compatibility with flexible substrates and thus presenting drawback in view of industrial scale roll to roll fabrication this can in principle be remedied by using poly ethylenedioxythiophene polystyrene sulfonate pedot pss as bottom selective contact thereby inverting the device structure though the hygroscopic nature of pedot pss would likely hamper the long term stability of the moisture sensitive perovskite it was then shown that the high temperature treatment for tio can be circumvented by using layer consisting of tio nanoparticles rather than one that is in situ formed by annealing precursor gel two strategies have been demonstrated so far either the deposition of nanoparticle dispersion or the direct precipitation of tio nanoparticles from solution onto the substrate both methods use ticl as the titanium source which produces hcl fumes when in contact with humidity and thus has to be handled with great care another method does use titanium isopropoxide tip as titanium source but requires the addition of graphene flakes to the resulting tio dispersion to obtain optimal performance here we present the chemical and morphological characterization of tip based sub processed tio electron acceptor layer consisting of nanoparticles and we investigate the influence of this layer on the morphology of the subsequently deposited perovskite layer the nanoparticulate tio layer is deposited from an alcoholic dispersion that is very easy to synthesize and the resulting planar heterojunction solar cells outperform previously reported analogs containing high temperature processed tio layers the resulting maximum obtained conversion efficiency of is to the authors knowledge the highest reported value for solution processed planar heterojunction solar cell based on mixed halide perovskite ch nh pbi xclx our tio nanoparticle dispersion was prepared using slight modification of procedure reported by katoch et al l of tip was added dropwise to solution of nitric acid in ml ethanol under mild stirring after stirring for l of demineralized water was added for the hydrolysis to proceed and the solution was left stirring for another hour the result was then diluted with propanol this transparent dispersion is ready for use with no need for centrifugation washing and redispersing and is stable for months figure a dispersion fig shows dynamic light scattering dls measurement of the dispersion revealing narrow size distribution with an average particle size of nm an ray diffraction xrd measurement of dried powder sample is shown in figure confirming the anatase phase of the material and confirming the crystal diameter measured with dls via scherrer equation recently it was shown by wojciechowski et al that the addition of small amount of titanium diisopropoxide bis acetylacetonate tiacac to tio dispersion can serve as electronic glue between the nanoparticles in the eventual nanoparticulate thin film enhancing its conductivity and thus improving the resulting solar cell built on it in addition the tiacac can also assist in the film formation itself figures f show atomic force microscopy afm micrographs of nm thin tio films spincoated on indium tin oxide ito rpm rpm s from m dispersion with the addition of mol of tiacac mole of tiacac per mole of tio annealed for different times at in air smooth films are obtained with low root mean square roughness of nm or less on ito as base layer the thermally treated tio covered ito substrates were then used to build planar heterojunction ch nh

filled glovebox followed by thermal treatment at for min layer of poly hexylthiophene ht nominally nm was then spincoated on top followed by the evaporation of nm of silver at pressure of mbar to complete the devices key observation is the influence of the thermal treatment of the tio on the performance of otherwise identical solar cells devices made from unannealed tio exhibit reasonable open circuit voltage voc but negligible short circuit current jsc and very low fill factor ff resulting in close to zero photovoltaic output fig the extremely low jsc and ff indicate the presence of very high series resistance likely induced by the presence of precursor products indeed when the tio is annealed at for only min we already find reasonable conversion efficiency of around jsc keeps increasing with longer tio thermal treatment finding maximum at min leading to an average efficiency of efficiencies of even up to fig were obtained using an adapted annealing treatment as recently described by saliba et al where the perovskite is slowly heated to and then fast to longer tio treatments tend to have vastly detrimental effect initially resulting in highly fluctuating performance and in the case of min annealing even in breakdown of all cells during the first measurement it must not be overlooked that the best efficiencies obtained with our new low temperature processed tio layer are considerably higher than those obtained by using sintered tio layer we reported before jsc ma cm voc ff to find the origin of the performance dependence on the thermal history of the tio layer chemical analysis of the layers was performed using ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps no other elements than the ones expected from the starting products n ti were found in the tio layers confirming their chemical purity to probe more into detail high resolution core level spectra were taken of relevant elements fig shows s spectra of tio layers that were annealed at for times from to min in the pristine case there are two clear components higher binding energy component that represents nitrates ev and low binding energy component that corresponds with nitrogen in carbonated environment ev resulting from nitric acid and both tip and tiacac respectively as the tio layer is annealed the nitrate component shrinks which is logical since the annealing temperature of is well above the boiling point of nitric acid however the nitrite component vanishes in favor of the component at lower binding energy indicating that the nitric acid is disintegrated and its nitrogen being incorporated in the organic matrix of tiacac and tip residue this is seconded by the corresponding s core level spectra fig as will be clarified in the following the s comprises three components one at ev c bonds one at ev n and o bonds and one at ev carboxyl we observe that the n o component at ev decreases upon annealing while the carboxylic component at ev increases these are the organic moieties from the tip and tiacac that oxidize due to the annealing being executed in air the small remainder of the peak at ev must therefore be c contribution corresponding with the nitrogen peak at ev notice that the complete disappearance of nitric acid at min of annealing coincides with the maximum obtained efficiency of the corresponding solar cells fig indicating that the presence of residual nitric acid induces parasitic series resistance in the device and could possibly cause interfacial recombination we turn our attention now to the ti spectra in fig comparing pristine versus min annealed layer it is immediately obvious that there is no elemental ti present in either case ev all ti is in the oxidation state ev it has previously been speculated that tiacac might decompose upon heating forming tiox that acts as mortar between tio particles thus increasing the resulting layer conductivity while annealing does induce decomposition of the carbonated part of tiacac as shown above the presence of ti in different oxidation states g or should be corroborated by additional peaks appearing at the low binding energy side of the main line in contrast our measured ti signal comprising only ti component that is unchanged upon annealing at reveals the absence of any ti or ti contributions to the spectrum in fact when analyzing the ti photoemission peak using physically motivated line shape single symmetric line turns out to be sufficient to describe the experimental data thus ruling out the presence of any additional components with oxidation state other than at this point one might speculate that degraded form of tiacac with oxidation state for ti is capable of bridging the voids between tio nanoparticles such that the resulting layer has better conductivity the source of an improved conductivity can indeed be traced back by comparing the ti core level region for layer after annealing at with that of conventional tio sol gel film sintered at both measured under identical experimental conditions fig clearly the low temperature deposition induces significant line broadening as compared to the sintered film as the line shape of the latter represents the combined effects of line broadening due to the finite life time of the photoionized states of the probed ti ions and ii the broadening induced by the finite energy resolution of the spectrometer the increased line width in case of the low temperature sample clearly points to an additional broadening effect this additional line broadening most likely arises from small fluctuations deviations in stoichiometry around the probed ti ions which can best be expressed as tio reflecting distribution of different chemically shifted components that superimpose to form the measured photoemission line consequently significant density of g defects acting as dopants must be present in the low temperature deposited titania films which can most probably be assigned to the mortar material easily explaining their improved conductivity based on the analysis of the s and s spectra it is clear why the tio layer needs thermal treatment of min to obtain optimally functioning solar cells decomposition of no though it is still obscure why longer annealing step results in much less performance and in worst case even shunting cells to shed more light onto the negative effect of prolonged annealing we now examine the perovskite layer scanning electron microscopy sem images were recorded to investigate whether the annealing time could have an influence on the consecutively deposited perovskite the series of images in fig reveal that there is indeed correlation between the thermal history of the tio and the morphology of the eventual perovskite layer the smoothest layer is obtained for pristine tio layer however the photovoltaic properties are as mentioned overshadowed in this case by the detrimental presence of hno an intermediate annealing time of the tio min returns grainy to needle like perovskite morphologies that closely resemble those we previously reported accompanied by decent photovoltaic performance those films do show number of pinholes but contrary to foregoing hypotheses this does not need to degrade the resulting performance significantly treatment beyond min appears to induce considerably coarser perovskite morphology that shows much larger holes of several square micrometers this is the likely cause why corresponding solar cells shunt easily at such holes there is only thin layer of ht nominally nm that separates the tio from the top silver contact so the occurrence of occasional short circuits is conceivable it also deserves to be mentioned that the gradual change in morphology seen in the sem results is paralleled by decrease in peak height of the hh peaks in xrd not shown indicating reduced preferential orientation of the perovskite crystals this might lead to inferior charge transport and could be an additional reason for the low performance of solar cells containing overly annealed tio layers the origin of the perovskite morphology dependence on the thermal history of the tio layer can be explained by the presented chemical analysis the observed increased presence of carboxyl moieties on the tio surface as function of annealing time points to an enhanced wettability of the surface for the dmso based perovskite precursor intuitively implying better film formation in spite of that the eventual perovskite layers show an opposite trend becoming rougher when deposited on longer annealed tio this can be rationalized by considering that the actual perovskite is formed only when the precursor film is heated e the initial solvent wetting properties are subordinate to the subsequent crystallization mechanism of the dried film as has been shown before high quality perovskite film is often more easily formed when preformed matrix or textured surface is available functioning as kind of seed layer therefore we propose that the organic residue from the starting products at ev in the s spectra in fig assists in the formation of smoother perovskite films upon the conversion into carboxylic compounds at ev there are fewer seeding options for the perovskite crystals causing them to form more rough and discrete structures rather than an uninterrupted film finally it is interesting to remark that our extremely smooth anatase tio layers having minimal contact area with the perovskite e rather sharp bilayer interface still allow for very high photocurrents this is in contrast with recent report from yella et al who observe that rather rough rutile tio layers having more intimate contact with the perovskite are more efficient at extracting electrons an explanation for this apparent inconsistency might be offered by their use of the triiodide based perovskite that generally has lower charge carrier diffusion lengths as opposed to the mixed halide variety in our case typically with higher diffusion length in the former case rougher tio film may assist in compensating for the slightly inferior charge carrier diffusion length of the triiode perovskite by creating an ersatz bulk heterojunction whereas in the latter case any additional roughness would be redundant in conclusion we introduced low temperature processable tio electron collection layer customized for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells the layer is deposited from an easy one pot synthesis nanoparticle dispersion and requires thermal treatment at only in contrast with the typical c baking steps for conventional tio base layers making it compatible with roll to roll fabrication on plastic foils even slightly lower temperatures could deliver the same outcome provided longer annealing times and or lower pressure in addition the resulting planar heterojunction devices significantly outperform their otherwise identical counterparts containing high temperature processed tio layer from this initial set of experiments an efficiency of is achieved which is at the time of writing the highest value for solution processed planar heterojunction mixed halide perovskite solar cells so far and the highest value for perovskite solar cell using ht as hole transporting layer the results also show that the chemical composition and thermal history of the nanoparticulate tio film have consequential impact on the device performance finally it cannot go unnoticed that the observed high photocurrents and fill factors are obtained even with films exhibiting significant amount of pinholes illustrating that the interplay between the selective contact and the perovskite is probably an even more important consideration than the smoothness of the perovskite itself  accelerating the discovery of advanced materials is essential for human welfare and sustainable clean energy in this paper we introduce the materials project www materialsproject org core program of the materials genome initiative that uses high throughput computing to uncover the properties of all known inorganic materials this open dataset can be accessed through multiple channels for both interactive exploration and data mining the materials project also seeks to create open source platforms for developing robust sophisticated materials analyses future efforts will enable users to perform rapid prototyping of new materials in silico and provide researchers with new avenues for cost effective data driven materials design major technological advancement is largely driven by the discovery of new materials from the prehistoric discovery of bronze and steel to the twentieth century invention of synthetic polymers new materials have been responsible for vast transformations in human civilization today materials innovations also hold the key to tackling some of our most pressing societal challenges such as global climate change and our future energy supply however materials discovery today still involves significant trial and error it can require decades of research to identify suitable material for technological application and longer still to optimize that material for commercialization principal reason for this long discovery process is that materials design is complex multi dimensional optimization problem and the data needed to make informed choices about which materials to focus on and what experiments to perform usually does not exist what is needed is scalable approach that leverages the talent and efforts of the entire materials community the materials genome initiative launched in in the united states is large scale collaboration between materials scientists both experimentalists and theorists and computer scientists to deploy proven computational methodologies to predict screen and optimize materials at an unparalleled scale and rate the time is right for this ambitious approach it is now well established that many important materials properties can be predicted by solving equations based on the fundamental laws of physics using quantum chemical approximations such as density functional theory dft this virtual testing of materials can be employed to design and optimize materials in silico many research groups have already employed this high throughput computational approach to screen up to tens of thousands of compounds for potential new technological materials examples include solar water splitters solar photovoltaics topological insulators scintillators co capture materials piezoelectrics and thermoelectrics with each study suggesting several new promising compounds for experimental follow up in the fields of catalysis hydrogen storage materials and li ion batteries experimental hits from high throughput computations have already been reported in recent years perhaps an even more exciting trend has begun to emerge which is the integration of computational materials science with information technology g web based dissemination databases data mining to go beyond the confines of any single research group this development has expanded access to computed materials datasets to new communities and spurred new collaborative approaches for materials discovery the next step is to leverage open source development and interactive web based technologies to enable user contributions back to the community by reporting problems coding new types of analyses and apps and suggesting the next set of breakthrough materials for computation all the pieces are ready to change the paradigm by which materials are designed in this paper we introduce the materials project www materialsproject org component of the materials genome initiative that leverages the power of high throughput computation and best practices from the information age to create an open collaborative and data rich ecosystem for accelerated materials design started in october of as joint collaboration between the massachusetts institute of technology and lawrence berkeley national laboratory the materials project today has partners in more than ten institutions worldwide the materials project web site currently receives several hundred unique page views day and has registered more than users in academia government and industry figure provides an overview of the materials project the materials project seeks to accelerate materials design by creating open collaborative systems targeting each step in the computational materials design process data creation validation dissemination analysis and design in secs ii we discuss the materials project current efforts and future directions in each of these areas one of the materials project key thrusts is to compute the properties of compounds for which experimental data may be incomplete or absent however there exist formidable technical and scientific hurdles to achieving this goal despite significant improvements in robustness and user friendliness of first principles codes it is still far from trivial to automate and store tens of thousands of calculations first principles calculations are computationally expensive single material might require several hundred central processing unit cpu hours just to obtain basic properties often require serial actions g one needs to calculate an optimized crystal structure before one can perform property calculations and often require human intervention to arrive at converged reliable result to address these issues the materials project has developed its own workflow software fireworks for automating and managing all computational steps at large supercomputing centers and job management software custodian to perform all the calculations needed to determine property as an example when performing energy optimization runs it automatically self heals by applying rule based fixes to failed runs updating cluster as well as convergence parameters the system can also automatically prevent duplicating jobs and apply different types of workflows when detecting for example metal versus an insulator these codebases will be further described in future publication but are already available as fully functional open source packages that can be leveraged by the computational research community using this infrastructure the materials project has built sizable materials database that today contains computed structural electronic and energetic data calculated using the vienna ab initio simulation package for over compounds figure obtained using over million cpu hours of computational time at the national energy research scientific computing center nersc today the vast majority of the materials project data are for compounds in the inorganic crystal structural database icsd going forward significant challenge is the generation of novel compositions and compounds to perform calculations this problem presents one of the foremost challenges in computational materials science there already exist multiple algorithmic approaches to tackle this problem optimization based approaches such as genetic algorithm and simulated annealing have been heavily investigated and data driven approaches are beginning to emerge but no technique is ideal however the growth of web based collaboration presents the opportunity for another method of generating new compounds crowd sourced suggestions coupled to computations on demand in this method crystal structures designed by the user community will be automatically fed into our calculation infrastructure with the results reported back to the community final concern when generating large data sets is validating the accuracy of the calculated data major challenge of the materials project is to present calculated data for broad audience including researchers who may be unfamiliar with the limitations of first principles methods one way to address calculation inaccuracy is to develop strategies that improve agreement with experimental results for example inaccurate reaction energies are sometimes obtained when employing single approximation g dft to calculate reactions between solids and gases between some elements and their binary compounds or between metals and insulators containing correlated or electrons the materials project reports more accurate results over such wide chemical spaces by employing separate methodologies including use of reported experimental data for different classes of materials and using set of reference reactions to connect results from different methods this approach has been employed for solid gas reactions block oxide reactions and dissolved ions in solution the materials project is similarly exploring methods for improving other predicted properties such as band gaps the project aims to report data in way that can be interpreted as much as possible at face value by any materials researcher and provide additional information to guide the user figure furthermore the materials project makes available see sec iii for more details the raw unmodified data to users who want to apply their own correction techniques or datamine errors within the computational methodologies despite continual improvements in calculation methods it is reality of high throughput computation that some of the data will be incorrect we are currently using both automated and crowd sourced means to verify the integrity of our data in terms of automated analysis we validate calculated oxidation states cell volumes and bond lengths versus experimental data and report clear visual warnings on the web site for compounds where these values fall outside normal limits for example the structures of many layered compounds that are bonded by van der waals interactions are not accurately modeled by standard dft functionals those materials display visual warning on the web site indicating that experimental and computational structures do not agree just as important as automated verification is the report issues button on the web page for each material which users can click to report problems with the data for example users have employed this button to report issues with the magnetic structure of several entries which would be otherwise difficult to detect automatically dissemination providing open multi channel access to materials once the data is generated and verified the materials project aims to provide access to the data in way that enables flexible and innovative usage the materials project provides multiple channels to access its large and rich materials dataset the primary access point for most users is the web applications which provide graphical user interfaces to query for various forms of raw and processed materials data several such applications are already available the materials explorer for example allows users to search for materials based on composition or property and explore their properties figure while the lithium battery explorer adds application specific search criteria such as voltage and capacity for targeted searches for lithium ion battery electrode materials additional web applications allow users to interactively analyze the dataset for instance the phase diagram app figure constructs low temperature phase diagrams for any chemical system supporting both closed systems and open systems grand canonical construction the reaction calculator balances reactions and computes reaction energies between any set of compounds in the database with comparisons to experimental reaction energies automatically reported where available going forward the materials project is committed to further expanding the number of quality web applications that provides sophisticated analyses of its data an application that generates computed pourbaix diagrams aqueous solubility based on the methodology of persson et al is currently in development the materials project also plans to leverage on the expertise of the large materials research community to create novel applications with materials data and provide the means for user submitted applications to be hosted in the future while web applications provide means for exploratory data analysis they are not an effective means for user to obtain large quantities of materials data the materials project recognizes that there may be users who require access to large datasets to datamine for trends across chemistries alternatively users may wish to build their own applications that combine local dataset with that of the materials project for instance to build unified phase diagram through the phase diagram app to support the needs of such users the materials project recently launched the materials application programming interface api this api provides users with direct access to the data and operates similarly to other web based information portals such as google maps that allow external developers to create their own applications or analyses from the data set the materials api is based on representational state transfer rest principles that provide data access via the hypertext transfer protocol http for the purposes of the materials project this means that each object such as material can be represented by unique url g http www materialsproject org rest unique id and an http verb can be used to act on that object this action then returns structured data typically in the widely used javascript object notation json high level interface to the materials api has been built into the open source python materials genomics pymatgen analysis library see sec iv that provides powerful way for users to programmatically query and analyze large quantities of materials information today the materials api only supports unidirectional information transfer from the materials project to the user future versions of the materials api will provide channel for users to transfer information to the materials project for example it will be the method by which users can submit compounds to the materials project for automatic computation calculations on demand it will also allow users to submit supplementary information about materials g the crowdsourcing of experimental data or tag compounds with publication references two way interaction will further broaden the scope of collaborative science possible within this framework analysis to extract useful insights from the data the dissemination of large and rich materials data sets must be complemented by accessible analysis tools for instance from the energies obtained from basic electronic structure calculations one can derive stability assessments via the construction of phase diagrams which is useful for most materials design and synthesis problems from computed band structures one can derive band gaps the nature of optical transitions indirect direct and effective masses of charge carriers which are useful for design of functional electronic materials such as thermoelectrics or transparent conducting oxides with large and rich materials data sets such as those in the materials project there is also the potential to apply statistical learning techniques to datamine trends across broad range of chemistries one such example is given in figure which plots the percentage of cr sites in fold or fold coordination in oxides as function of oxidation state the data support known chemical principles the smaller cr ion strongly favors fold tetrahedral coordination while the larger cr ion strongly favors fold octahedral coordination the materials project believes that the best way to develop robust and insightful analyses is by leveraging on the expertise of the entire materials research community to this end the materials project adopts the best practices of open source software development to build collaborative platforms for materials data analysis almost all of the software infrastructure powering the materials project is publicly available under open source licenses for example the python materials genomics library defines core python objects for materials data representation and provides well tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications pymatgen already has more than active collaborators worldwide and continues to grow in functionality and robustness every day some examples of community contributions include support for effective feff calculations contributed by alan dozier from the university of kentucky and for abinit calculations by matteo giantomassi at universit catholique de louvain database add on pymatgen db enables the creation of local materials project like mongodb databases from high throughput computations that researchers can use to store and query their calculated datasets all software components are hosted on github www github com social coding platform that allows users to report bugs and contribute to development the libraries can also be easily installed using pip or easy install through the python package index design virtual laboratory for new materials computed information and analyses should ultimately culminate in new materials design an example of this process is depicted in figure using combination of several materials project tools it is possible to perform many aspects of materials design in silico one can imagine scientist looking for material with certain band structure features and thermodynamic stability criteria from searching the materials explorer the user finds very suitable ruthenium containing oxide compound but the cost associated with ruthenium excludes the material from being commercially viable candidate with the assistance of applications such as the crystal toolkit and structure predictor the user is able to design range of viable compounds consisting of less expensive transition metal ions with similar size and valence the user then submits the designs to the materials project and receives the results within few days where the electronic properties as well as the thermodynamic stability of the novel compounds are assessed using the materials explorer and phase diagram app compounds that meet property targets can then be fed into higher order calculations or immediately forwarded to the lab for experimental investigation real world example of such computational design workflow is illustrated in figure where we describe the steps in the discovery of novel class of carbonophosphate compounds for li ion battery cathode applications prediction of stable compounds and decision to use na li ion exchange for synthesis were largely done using computation along with screening the candidates for promising battery properties the computational data served to focus the experimental synthesis as well as the electrochemical testing to only the most promising portions of chemical space even in the short span of time since its inception in october we have begun to see the application of materials project data in materials design by researchers outside of the core group of developers users have already employed the data from the site in variety of applications including benchmarking theoretical investigations and in the design of li ion battery anodes photocatalysts and magnetic materials advanced materials are essential to human well being and to form the cornerstone for emerging industries unfortunately the traditional time frame for moving advanced materials from the laboratory into applications is remarkably long often taking years the materials genome initiative of which the materials project is part is multi stakeholder effort to develop an infrastructure to accelerate advanced materials discovery and deployment the materials project combines high throughput computation web based dissemination and open source analysis tools to provide material scientists with new angles to attack the materials discovery problem looking ahead the materials project aims to form backbone that can be expanded to new areas as new theoretical techniques are developed they can be plugged in to our workflow engine and applied across all materials in the database efforts targeting prediction of surface energies elastic constants point defects and finite temperature properties using large data sets and novel algorithms are underway the dissemination and front end tools are being expanded to new datasets such as experimental data for comparison with computed results finally calculations on demand feature will allow scientists to directly contribute new compound ideas to the database far from being final product the materials project is an evolving resource that we expect will grow more useful from ever increasing data sets and network effects from its user base it is our belief that deployment of large scale accurate information to the materials development community will significantly accelerate and enable the discovery of improved materials for our future clean energy systems green building components cutting edge electronics and improved societal health and welfare  when wind turbines are deployed in large arrays their ability to extract kinetic energy from the flow decreases due to complex interactions among them the terrain topography and the atmospheric boundary layer in order to improve the understanding of the vertical transport of momentum and kinetic energy across boundary layer flow with wind turbines wind tunnel experiment is performed the boundary layer flow includes array of model wind turbines particle image velocity measurements in volume surrounding target wind turbine are used to compute mean velocity and turbulence properties averaged on horizontal planes results are compared with simple momentum theory and with expressions for effective roughness length scales used to parametrize wind turbine arrays in large scale computer models the impact of vertical transport of kinetic energy due to turbulence and mean flow correlations is quantified it is found that the fluxes of kinetic energy associated with the reynolds shear stresses are of the same order of magnitude as the power extracted by the wind turbines highlighting the importance of vertical transport in the boundary layer if wind energy is to become substantial contributor to the world overall energy supply mix wind farms both on and off shore are expected to become larger and cover increasingly extended areas for single wind turbine the kinetic energy harvested is due to the difference in upstream and downstream kinetic energy fluxes for large arrays the kinetic energy must be entrained from the flow overhead e vertical transport becomes crucial ingredient in determining the overall efficiency of large wind farms in order to help understand the macroscopic structure of this vertical transport it is convenient to study the horizontally averaged flow structure in the vertical direction therefore the present paper is devoted to such study based on experimental mean velocity and turbulent stress measurements in small wind tunnel model of an array of wind turbines as argued recently in frandsen et al the structure of individual wind turbine wakes has been studied extensively see g refs as have the details of blade aerodynamics and single turbine optimization for maximum power extraction for useful reviews see refs and also number of studies and models have been developed taking into account the superposition of wakes stemming from finite number of wind turbines even considering the limit of an infinitely large array these can be considered bottom up approaches to the problem of understanding the structure of large wind farms approaching the problem from another top down direction wind turbines in large array are often modeled as surface roughness elements leading to an increased roughness length that needs to be parametrized examples of such studies include papers that aim at predicting interactions among wind turbine farms with the global climate regional meteorology or more short time weather patterns the reynolds averaged navier stokes boundary layer equation in the streamwise direction at high reynolds number is given by eq where v and are the streamwise vertical and transverse velocities respectively in directions y and and contrary to the atmospheric sciences convention where is usually the vertical direction u v y u dp xu yu zu fx primes indicate turbulent fluctuations the force term fx is the thrust effect of the wind turbine that acts only in the region where the wind turbine is located it includes pressure and viscous forces acting at the moving blade air interface the overbar denotes time averaging so the term fx also has been averaged over time to eliminated periodic time dependence from the rotating blades note that the viscous terms have been neglected in this equation because distances sufficiently far from the ground are here considered where viscous stresses have negligible effect on the mean the coriolis force term is also neglected because even though it is warranted in the atmosphere in the outer parts of the boundary layer flow it is not relevant in the wind tunnel flow the mean velocity distribution is complex three dimensional field including wakes the boundary layer shear etc further simplification can be sought by performing horizontal spatial average over directions spanwise and streamwise denoted by brackets in the direction if the boundary layer is developing the averaging is understood as an average over at least one row of wind turbines horizontal averaging is commonplace in studies of vegetation canopies and the reader is referred to refs and for more details this spatial averaging and the classical boundary layer approximations yield u v y dp dx u u fx where the dispersive stress v arises due to correlations among the spatially nonhomogeneous horizontal and vertical mean velocities the deviation velocities that determine the dispersive stress are defined according to u and v in this paper spatial horizontal averaging will be denoted by or at places also indicating as subscripts which directions are being averaged over as in xz in classical boundary layers without the presence of wind turbines in the inner region say below where is the boundary layer thickness the advective terms and the pressure gradient are negligible for distances above the ground that are significantly larger than the viscous height or the roughness length an approximately constant reynolds stress region is postulated in which v i where the vertical flux of horizontal momentum is dominated and carried exclusively by the turbulence in the presence of wind turbines in the wind turbine array boundary layer we believe it is still instructive to consider the surface layer simplification and consider what are expected to be the dominant terms there motivation is that in wind farms the typical order of magnitude of the atmospheric boundary layer height is about whereas the wind turbines occupy height up to about i still within region that can be considered the inner surface layer in this region the dominant terms in the horizontally averaged description are expected to be u u fx multiplying the momentum equation by mean velocity leads to the mechanical energy equation describing the kinetic energy in the horizontally averaged mean flow the equation reads u v y dp dx u u v u u u u p where y is the the product of the spatially averaged velocity and the averaged thrust force fx the power density extracted from the flow by the wind turbines is slightly different namely fx in the inlet region of wind farm the first advective term e the streamwise derivative of the mean flow kinetic energy flux is expected to be important for very large wind turbine arrays the developing terms become less important in the surface layer and the dominant terms are expected to become u u v u u u u p the objectives of this paper are to perform measurements of the turbulent momentum and kinetic energy flux terms v and u respectively and to compare them with the dispersive fluxes caused by spatial variations e terms v and u also vertical profiles of turbulent and dispersive dissipations e v y and v y respectively will be measured these are called dissipation because if they are positive they are interpreted as loss of kinetic energy in the horizontally averaged mean flow the turbulent dissipation v y is also the negative of the production of turbulent kinetic energy which ultimately is dissipated due to viscous effects the dissipation due to dispersive stresses v y is the loss of mean horizontal kinetic energy into kinetic energy associated with the spatial fluctuations of the mean flow around this horizontal mean flow one goal is to assess the typical magnitudes of these terms and compare them to the mechanical power extracted by the wind turbines at this stage it is also instructive to review the momentum theory developed in refs and starting from the inner approximation in eq and integrating between some height on top of the wind turbine canopy yhi across the heights corresponding to the wind turbine disks down to ylo one obtains v yhi v ylo fd where fd is the total drag force per unit mass and per unit horizontal area it can be obtained by vertical integration fd yh yh fx dy where yh is the hub height and is the rotor diameter and the drag on tower and hub are neglected applying standard equilibrium layer theory it can be postulated that there are two equilibrium layers one above the wind turbine canopy with friction velocity hi v yhi and second layer below the wind turbine array where the friction velocity is reduced due to the momentum lost to the wind turbines and equals lo v ylo and again it is recalled that viscous forces due to the ground surface are expected to be negligible at these heights useful estimates of these friction velocities can be made if one relates the force fd to the mean flow velocity at hub height simple model is to assume that the mean velocity in the two constant stress layers follow separate logarithmic equilibrium profiles where the vertical extent of the rotor is effectively zero for the bottom and top boundary layers one may write y lo ln yy lo for yh y hi ln yy hi foryh equivalently one may write eqs and as y ln yu u defining an effective velocity shift for each of the profiles ulo and uhi the velocity shift is related to the effective roughness according to b ln y where is the von rm constant is the usual shift in the boundary layer and is the roughness height of either the low or high portion of the profiles now assuming that the wind turbines are exposed to typical velocity on the order of the mean velocity at hub height yh one may write the momentum balance eq as ref hi lo ct u hi ln yhy hi sxszd above the horizontal spacings of wind turbines are sxd and szd in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively and ct is the thrust coefficient of the turbine the above equation may be simplified tou hi lo ct sxsz lnyhy hi hi another objective of the present experimental study is to measure the representative values of the friction velocities below and above the wind turbine array and from their difference study possible effects on the effective roughness length hi or velocity shift uhi in order to measure profiles of horizontally averaged quantities such as mean velocities mean reynolds stresses and dispersive stresses it is necessary to perform measurements in sufficient detail so that the initially distributions may be integrated in horizontal planes in sec ii the experiments conducted for this purpose are described in detail measurements were carried out in the corrsin wind tunnel at the johns hopkins university this is return type two storey facility with primary and secondary contractions the test section is high wide and long inflow conditions that aim at reproducing those prevalent in the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer under neutral conditions are generated by means of an active grid strakes and surface roughness as depicted in fig high levels of free stream turbulence are generated using an active grid the active grid design follows that of refs and and consists of seven vertical and five horizontal rotating aluminum shafts the shafts are made of mm square aluminum tubes each shaft is independently actuated by hp ac motor likewise each motor is controlled independently and is set to randomly change direction and rotational speed every second within range of and rpm the horizontal and vertical shafts have eight and six winglets respectively winglets are mm agitators made of mm thick aluminum plates these plates have circular perforations with diameter of mm additional details about the driving mechanism control of the active grid and decay laws can be found in ref strakes are used to recreate mean velocity shear profile at the inlet similar strakes have already been used in other wind tunnel experiments of environmental boundary layers nine strakes as shown in fig are equally distributed from the sidewalls of the test section on plane normal to the flow direction and located at from the leading edge they are made out of mm thick acrylic plate using laser cutting piecewise linear function is used to describe the shape of the strakes such that the blockage decreases with wall normal distance in turn these result in velocity and turbulence intensity gradients the flow develops over rough flat plate used to model the rough terrain in which wind turbines typically operate the plate is long mm thick and spans the width of the test section it is located downstream of the active grid and has an elliptical leading edge with profile the flat plate is entirely covered with grit aluminum oxide sand paper an independent laboratory performed the characterization of the topography of the surface roughness the ten point height or the average of the five highest peaks and the five deepest valleys yield value for the roughness height of mm full details of the roughness can be found in ref an array of model wind turbines was constructed and mounted on the flat plate the three bladed wind turbine rotor has diameter of cm and the tower is yh cm high as shown in fig the rotors were cut from sheet metal and twisted from at the root to at the tip these angles are measured from plane normal to the flow and were arrived at after some trial and error experimentation by twisting the blades at different angles with the goal of producing angular velocities that would correspond to desired ranges of tip speed ratio due to the complexity of the flow in which the wind turbine models operate the resulting rotation speeds were not exactly equal in all of the turbines differing by about see sec ii below the blade thickness is uniform and equal to mm the towers of the models are built using rapid prototyping comparing with field scales and assuming m turbines with hub height of means that models of wind turbines are scaled down about times from real life length scales this is also approximately the ratio of relevant reynolds numbers since the characteristic velocities in the wind tunnel as well as the fluid viscosity will be similar to those prevalent in field conditions hence dynamic similarity will certainly not be achieved in representing the detailed wind blade and other interactions this has to be kept in mind when interpreting the results which will focus instead on the large scale transport properties of the turbulence where reynolds number effects are known to be less dominant nine wind turbine models are placed in array and are separated three and seven rotor diameters in the crosswind and downwind directions respectively sx and sz the array and its placement is depicted in fig the array was placed downstream of the leading edge and separated rotor diameters from the sidewall the blockage ratio of the wind turbine model to the wind tunnel area is calculated by dividing the cross section area of the space over the plate by the projected area of three wind turbine models including the three rotor disk areas and projected area of three towers this results in relatively low value of small ratio is important in order to allow relatively unimpeded expansion of the wakes past studies have had ratios ranging from to with most studies in the lower half of that range see ref the overall experimental arrangement of the wind turbine array in the test section is shown in the photograph in fig hot wire measurements are performed to characterize the inflow conditions cross wire probe with spatial resolution of is used to sample data points per measurement point at sampling rate of khz e duration of all hot wire measurements are conducted at from the leading edge and upstream of the wind turbine array mean velocities and turbulent fluctuations are measured in the three spatial directions by positioning the hot wire probe in y and z planes mean velocity and reynolds stress profiles are examined to analyze the uniformity of the flow in the spanwise direction measurements are taken at fixed streamwise and wall normal location at height of m and traversed from to with an increment of cm results display reasonable homogeneity of the flow in the transverse direction upstream of the wind turbine array small difference was observed with the maximum deviation of mean velocity across the spanwise direction equal to s while the deviations in reynolds stress profiles were less than then mean vertical profiles of streamwise velocity and reynolds stresses are analyzed to characterize the flow in the wall normal direction measurements of the streamwise velocity were performed at different wall normal locations from to figure presents the streamwise mean velocity y as function of height in fig the data are fitted using the log law eq using the measured shear stress see below friction velocity of m is determined using the fitted roughness scale can then be obtained and is approximately equal to mm see solid line for the scaled atmospheric boundary layer this surface roughness height would translate into distributed roughness of an average height of cm which is consistent with very rough open terrain vegetated surface conditions figure shows the reynolds stress profiles of the inflow normalized with the peak shear stress measured near cm the profile of u increases as the wall is approached as would be expected for atmospheric boundary layers while v and w show peak also near cm but then decrease closer to the wall this near wall decrease differs from what is expected for atmospheric boundary layers and can be traced to the effects of the strakes which may damp turbulence in the near wall regions our focus will be mainly on heights between and cm the hub height of cm is much larger than of the boundary layer height therefore unlike the assumption in eq we do not expect to see log layer above the array of wind turbines in the present wind tunnel experiments this limitation of the experimental length scale ratios will affect the interpretation of results still the relationship between the momentum fluxes right above and right below the wind turbine region specifically their difference being given by the integrated drag from the wind turbines as expressed in eqs and is still applicable moreover one may expect to see log layer underneath the wind turbine array longitudinal energy spectra of streamwise and cross stream velocity components measured by the wire probe at cm are shown with solid and dashed lines respectively in fig they are normalized with measurement height which is almost the same as the hub height or rotor diameter and friction velocity to improve statistics and range of wavenumbers the energy spectra are combined from the results using two different numbers of bins for fft that is bins are used for the energy spectra in range of while bins are used in range of the vertical arrow corresponds to the wavenumber of the particle image velocimetry piv resolution kh with mm in the inertial range both and collapse which indicates isotropic behavior there is slope change near as can be expected in atmospheric turbulent boundary layers with production range see g ref but unlike real atmospheric boundary layers the extent of possible production range scaling is quite short perhaps decade piv measurements are carried out around the wind turbine model in the center of the third row in order to examine an entire volume around wind turbine most representative of conditions in large array tsi stereoscopic piv system is used with double pulse nd yag laser of mj pulse and with time between pulses of the laser beam passes through cylindrical lens to create laser sheet with thickness of mm two megapixel cross autocorrelation digital ccd cameras are used to capture the images the field of view has dimensions of about cm and resolution of mm this resolution captures of u and v based on the integration of the energy spectra measured with the much higher resolution hot wire system up to kh shown in fig as shown in fig piv measurements are performed on planes nine planes are measured upstream of the target model turbine and nine planes downstream an angled mirror is placed at the bottom wall to reflect the laser sheet thus reducing undesired reflections and scattering and allowing to measure considerably closer to the wall the angled mirror was mm high mm wide and cm long and had an angle of the mirror was moved with each measurement plane the piv system was calibrated before measuring each plane calibration target consisting of marker grid composed of white dots and cross in the center on black background was used the piv software uses the cross to identify the center of the target the location of the target in the direction was determined by measuring the distance from the cross to the blade tip of the rotor thus for the direction the target location was estimated as the distance from the rough plate to the center cross two perspective calibration images one for each camera were taken for the calibration the expected uncertainty of the velocity vectors in the y plane the piv data plane from the piv measurements is about the expected error in the component coming from the stereo piv is larger although difficult to estimate therefore the component will be used only to compute the mean velocity but not turbulence properties in this paper an optical sensor is used to trigger the piv externally in order to perform measurements at any desired phase the monarch instrument visible optical led light source sensor has an operating range of rpm and is placed downstream of the wind turbine array data in upstream planes are not phase locked since no significant phase dependence is expected because of the distance from the second row of wind turbines for present experimental conditions the optical sensor is also used to measure the average angular velocity of the target wind turbine v transistor transistor logic signal is generated when the laser beam is reflected from piece of reflecting tape mounted on the rear rotor blade the signal is sampled for and digitized by using the d converter over the entire measurements the average angular velocity was constant at rpm with maximum deviation of for all experiments the reference mean velocity of the wind tunnel remained constant at s this reference velocity was measured using pitot tube at location upstream of the active grid downstream of the secondary contraction of the wind tunnel for piv measurements samples were taken at each plane at rate of hz e not time resolved for the planes downstream of the wind turbine model phase locked measurements were performed to enable analysis of periodic structures two thousand images were collected for each phase total of six phases separated by dividing the total rotation between blades into six intervals for the data analysis performed in the present study no phase averaging is performed and so all phases are used in computing averages at the experimental conditions the wind turbine angular velocity of the target wind turbine was rpm as measured using the optical sensor the other wind turbines angular velocities were measured with hand held tachometer which was difficult to use due to time varying readings using this instrument it was verified that the other wind turbine rotation speeds were within about of the angular velocity of the target wind turbine static pressure measurements were also made with series of pressure taps on the wind tunnel sidewall the measurements have an uncertainty of about the piv data are postprocessed using fft based cross correlation analysis on the conditioned image pairs by dividing them into pixel interrogation regions with overlap recursive nyquist grid is used as the grid engine to process the images in multiple passes down to pixels this postprocessing produces the instantaneous velocity vector maps these velocity maps are then averaged to obtain the mean and fluctuating quantities in the different planes in the front planes samples per plane are averaged to produce converged statistics in the back planes where phase locked data are acquired the average consists of samples per plane due to the six phases taken into consideration convergence test is carried out by averaging and samples the results between and samples match very well and so samples are sufficient to ensure well converged statistics in both the mean and higher order moments for the data downstream of the wind turbine all available data sets are used to obtain an average over all phases we remark that phase averaging analysis of these data reveals very little differences between phases e the turbulence overwhelms any periodic behavior that could be correlated with the rotor phase angle since there are slight misalignments among the points at which data are available on the different y planes to allow consistent statistical and visualization analysis further postprocessing is performed for each of the planes the averaged data are mapped onto common grid with common and locations among the nine planes at different locations common grid is generated by identifying the common area among the planes front and back planes independently this grid is divided into grid with grid spacings of mm the velocities are then mapped into the common grid from their previous grid using bilinear interpolation the common area has dimensions of cm this common grid will allow to create spatial averages of the data as will be explored in sec iv spatial distributions of velocity and spatial distributions of mean velocity and reynolds stresses are obtained on each data plane and are shown as contour plots in figs and respectively the planes surround the middle turbine in the last row of turbines which is located at z and hub height yc combined the data sample volume around that turbine covering volume of d in the streamwise vertical and spanwise directions respectively the contours have been stretched in the direction for visualization purposes the sense of rotation of the rotors is in the negative direction e in the view angle of figs and in counterclockwise direction on fig the streamwise mean velocity contour shows indications of the wake of the upstream wind turbine as lower velocity in the middle planes before approaching the target wind turbine there is also significant further streamwise velocity decrease as the flow approaches the wind turbine rotor as in the classic streamtube analysis analyzing the midplane downstream of the wind turbine strong hub wake can be observed it diffuses relatively rapidly with the overall rotor wake in less than two diameters downstream we observe slight asymmetry when comparing the streamwise velocity in between columns of wind turbines with larger velocities in the canyon at negative compared with the canyon at positive such column to column variations have been observed in large eddy simulation les studies the origin of these variations is not clearly understood at this time the wake angular velocity see below does not seem to explain this trend figure shows the vertical mean velocity contours and shows an upward deflection as the flow approaches and begins to interact with the wind turbine also the flow in front of the rotor is deflected downward in smaller amount as the air is deflected under the hub the results show significant top down asymmetry due to the blockage effect of the ground and the vertical prevailing velocity gradient of the boundary layer vertical mean velocity contours on the wake show left right asymmetry with upward motion on the left negative and downward velocity on the right positive this is consistent with clockwise fluid angular momentum as expected from conservation of angular momentum this clockwise rotation is in the opposite direction as the angular velocity of the rotor figure depicts the mean spanwise velocity contours contours located upstream of the wind turbine show the flow of air around the sides of the rotor in asymmetric fashion contours in the wake region show positive velocity in the direction in the upper portion of the wake and negative spanwise velocity below the hub these trends are again consistent with clockwise wake angular momentum in the wake the left right asymmetry observed in the distribution can be attributed to blockage from the wall the normal reynolds stress distributions in streamwise and vertical direction are shown in figs and the elevated variances in the wake region are clearly visible also the direction variance significantly exceeds that in the vertical and spanwise directions the reynolds shear stress contours are shown in fig upstream contours show the shear layer characteristic stress from the wake of the preceding wind turbine the additional shear generated by the velocity defect created by the upstream turbine is still far from being diffused with the free stream also as far as the turbulent fluxes is concerned moreover very small shear stress is observed in locations below the hub height showing that the shear characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer have been modified significantly by the wake in the case of the downstream contours in the lower region below the hub negative shear stress v is visible which recovers at increasing distances beyond the wind turbine the middle plane shows high shear stress at the tip and the root of the rotor similar behavior is observed in the planes at the sides the induction factor defined as the fractional reduction in velocity between the incoming reference velocity and the velocity prevailing at the rotor can be obtained from the data as uback ufront where ufront and uback correspond to the average streamwise velocities upstream and downstream of the wind turbine rotor inside streamtube that passes through the rotor disk these velocities are estimated directly from the piv measured data for simplicity an axisymmetric streamtube across the wind turbine model is assumed then the induction factor is computed by averaging the velocity through concentric circles upstream and downstream of the wind turbine model for this two cross stream locations are selected at upstream and downstream of the wind turbine model using bilinear interpolation in the and directions cross stream planes of resolution of are computed from piv data these two planes are interpolated in the direction and an additional cross stream plane located at the rotor location is thus obtained at the rotor plane the velocities inside of circle of rotor diameter m and centered at the model hub are averaged the resulting volumetric flux through the rotor is s and the mean velocity at the interpolated rotor disk is s the volumetric flux is then computed for several concentric circles upstream and downstream at upstream position m and downstream position m range in which the streamlines are seen to expand this is repeated for different diameters until the flux through those circles matches that through the rotor the resulting diameters for the upstream and downstream circles are and mm respectively the small expansion of the streamtube can be attributed to the low loading and low power that the wind turbine model extracts from the flow the average velocities for the upstream circle were and s for the downstream one with these velocities the induction factor is computed resulting in a value characteristic of lightly loaded wind turbine thus the ideal stream tube analysis for this value of would imply thrust coefficient ct a and power coefficient of cp a visualizations of the entire streamtube not shown verify that the assumption of circular cross section is quite good for the purposes of estimating the induction factor in order to assess the sensitivity of these calculations to spatial resolution in the piv data we point out that the mm resolution when multiplied by the maximum observed mean velocity gradient in the data planes of about would map to maximum mean velocity uncertainty of about the mean velocity difference between front and back planes is on the order of of the mean velocity since the induction factor is proportional to the mean velocity difference the uncertainty in the obtained induction factor can be estimated to be about using as reference velocity the upstream stream tube average velocity of ufront s the rotor radius d cm and the target turbine angular velocity of rpm the tip speed ratio is ufront the results from the pressure measurements on the wind tunnel sidewalls are shown in fig they show significant pressure drops as expected across the active grid ag the strake region and slight pressure drop along the developing boundary layer the streamwise pressure gradient variation is relatively small in the area surrounding the last row of wind turbines consistent with the previous analysis of friction velocities and drag forces in sec however the wind tunnel sidewall pressure gives only rough indication of the local pressure drop and does not allow us to relate it with the detailed pressure distributions around the wind turbines however the results are consistent with pressure drop of about dp dx pa through the region with the three wind turbines e between x where is measured from the active grid indeed the results appear reasonable in that for the first wind turbine row location at m the pressure is slightly larger as expected in front of turbine while the trend is opposite for the second row turbine where the pressure measurement location falls just behind the wind turbine and the pressure is lower than the global trend the level of the measurement uncertainty in the pressure is only about pa so the relatively larger pressure at m than that behind the second row can be attributed to the combination of the relatively larger pressure drop that occurs just behind the second row of wind turbines and the pressure recovery at m behind the last row in this section the data are described in terms of horizontally averaged variables the definition of the horizontal spatial averaging of variable x z xz requires evaluating integrals over the horizontal plane around single target wind turbine domain according to xz lxlz lx lx lz lz x z dxdz where for convenience we have assumed that the target wind turbine is located at and and lx sxd and lz szd are the streamwise and transverse lengths of wind turbine domain in the array the integration is approximated as summation using trapezoidal rule on the piv data grid this approach is equivalent to assuming linear interpolation between the available grid points where the data are available in the transverse direction data are available in the entire span between lz and lz on nine planes as explained in sec ii the central five of the nine planes are distributed with spacings of cm in the region where the turbine disk is located while four more planes nine at each side are spaced cm apart the averaging in the direction is thus evaluated according to z y j x zj x zj zj with zj for and zj for streamwise integration is performed in four different ways thus defining four horizontal averages the averages in the front domain by integrating only in the available volume upstream of the turbine according to r xi z xi z with m the averaging is denoted by xz the averages in the back domain downstream of the turbine using similar expression but for index limits to where represents the location xi the back averages are denoted by denoted by xz cases and these cases represent total averages approximating the results expected to hold over the entire domain integrating between d and d since data are not available on the entire length in the direction linear interpolation and or extrapolation across the missing volumes is used the three missing volumes are where the wind turbine is located e between cm and cm and upstream between and and downstream between and as can be seen in the contours in fig the variation across planes around the volume where the turbine is located is relatively smooth and so errors introduced by the assumptions underlying linear interpolation across this missing data volume are not expected to be large in order to approximate the data in missing volumes up and downstream of the data volumes two approaches are used and compared assuming periodic behavior the back data are replicated upstream of the front data and the front data are copied downstream as if it was in periodic arrangement see fig as result the trapezoidal rule can be interpreted as equivalent to extending the sum to span from and setting the extended values x z and x z equal to those on the periodically repeated volumes the corresponding locations are m and m the quality of the available piv data is more reliable away from the edges of the data planes and so we use data rows into the domain e we set z y z y and z y z y the corresponding total averaged values are denoted by xz tp total periodic the last approach is to simply take the end point values and extrapolate in the streamwise direction assuming constant values in this approach we use z y z y and z y z y for the outside values for the missing data around the wind turbine we assume z y z y for and z y z y for m the corresponding total averaged values are denoted by xz tc total constant in summary we define the four different types of profiles according to xz y i z xi r xi x m xz y i z xi r xi x m for cases and while for cases and we have xz tq d r xi r xi xi m m m and xi otherwise figure shows the four vertical profiles of streamwise velocity obtained according to the procedure described in sec iii the profile computed in the back region displays clear wake behavior while the profile in the front region shows weaker already diffused wake from the upstream wind turbine the solid line shows the total averaged profile assuming periodic replication while the circles use the constant extrapolation the fact that they are quite close provides support for the procedure employed namely that filling in the missing data assuming reasonable behaviors periodic or constant has little impact on the total profile the most severe spatial deviations from the measured values are expected to occur in the immediate neighborhood of the wind turbine but the overall volume occupied by these regions is small compared with the total and so they do not have large weight on the overall averaged variables since the two methods of interpolation give essentially the same results henceforth we only show results for methods and the latter using the linear interpolation approach also note that because the profiles are for horizontally averaged quantities the wake may appear to be smaller than the rotor disk figure shows the vertical profiles of reynolds shear stresses while fig shows the profiles of variances obtained in the front and back regions as well as in the total domain using the periodic extrapolation it can be seen in fig that above the wind turbine region the peak shear stress level is about v xz yhi s whereas in the lower region below the wind turbines the shear stress is about v xz ylo s the former implies friction velocity of hi s and is slightly higher than the inflow condition value at the lower height the result implies lower friction velocity of lo s figure displays the mean velocity profiles in linear log units the gray dashed line above the wind turbines denotes possible logarithmic profile using the measured friction velocity hi s and displacement velocity of or equivalently roughness height of hi mm the figure has no indication of logarithmic profile there which is not surprising since the overall boundary layer thickness is not sufficiently high for such layer to develop in our experiment still if such layer were to develop the intercept or roughness height hi would be approximately as quoted of course with possible deviations on the order of or more the gray dashed line below the wind turbines denotes possible logarithmic profile using the measured friction velocity lo s and displacement velocity of as can be seen in fig of ref for or so fully rough regime and log linear relationship between and roughness length scales such as in eq can be assumed to be valid in our experiment this holds for the inflow condition upstream of the wind turbines as well as above the wind turbines for or so the flow is known to be transitionally rough see again fig of ref therefore fit using effective roughness is not meaningful there because the low reynolds number in such almost viscous dominated limit is more meaningful parameter than the effective roughness lo figure shows the profile of dispersive stress v xz computed from the spatial fluctuations in mean velocity differences between the temporally averaged mean velocity and their horizontal average different lines again denote different spatial domains as in fig as can be seen by comparing with fig the dispersive stresses are much smaller than the reynolds stresses although their behavior in the back wake region differs significantly from the smoother and positive trend in the front region as will be seen later this has implications for the balance of terms in the kinetic energy equation see below next we turn our attention to profiles arising in the kinetic energy equation see eq first in fig are profiles of v xzd xz dy the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation in the horizontally averaged energy budget positive values denote loss of mean kinetic energy to turbulence e in the budget of turbulent kinetic energy this is source term as usual peak values are observed above and below the wind turbine region furthermore fig shows profiles of v xzd xz dy the kinetic energy dissipation in the horizontally averaged energy budget due to the dispersive stresses as can be seen in the total region this term is very low interestingly in the wake back region it is negative and rises to about of the peak turbulent dissipation in the same region this implies that the mean horizontally averaged flow gains kinetic energy there from the spatial deviations of the mean flow this is consistent with the notion that in the wake energy is recovered by the wake recovery finally in fig are shown profiles of flux of kinetic energy due to turbulent transport v xz xz as comparison the generally smaller fluxes caused by the dispersive stresses are also shown only for the case of integrating over the total domain with the assumption of periodicity to avoid clutter positive flux means downward transport of kinetic energy as discussed in more detail in sec b the difference in fluxes across the wind turbine canopy plays an important role in determining the kinetic energy available to be extracted by the turbine in large array the results of sec iv are discussed here in terms of important aspects of the momentum balance and effective roughness scale for wind turbine arrays sec a and in terms of kinetic energy fluxes and power extracted sec b based on considerations of momentum theory in this section we compare the value of the roughness height that was inferred very approximately in sec iv namely hi mm with predictions of two methods the lettau formula and the formula proposed by frandsen et al as argued in sec such formulas are useful in large scale simulations see g ref and the lettau formula proposed in ref is given byy lett ss where is the height of the roughness elements which can be taken here as the hub height yh and is the rotor disk area d also sxszd is the horizontal area per wind turbine e sxsz in our case as result for our array the lettau formula predicts lett mm significantly larger than the value estimated from the data the approach proposed in refs and based on eq and solving for hi can be used to obtainy yhexp sxsz ct lo hi the result depends on the rotor thrust coefficient ct geometric parameters sx sz yh the von karman constant as well as on the ratio of friction velocities lo hi making assumptions about the mean velocity profile this ratio can further be modeled see refs and in terms of available parameters however here we will use the measured values lo hi in order to minimize the number of assumptions that need to be made using the value ct a estimated in sec iii from the measured induction factor and replacing the values sx sz we obtain f yh for yh this gives f mm slightly smaller than the lettau formula but still larger than that estimated from the data several effects may cause the discrepancy likely effect that is useful to consider in interpreting the experiments is the possible influence of pressure gradient while it was neglected using the inner region approximation the fact is that the pressure gradient across the wind turbine array is not exactly zero as shown in fig if the effect of pressure gradient integrated across the disk height difference is included in the momentum balance eq is changed toy yhexp sxsz ct u hi dp dx lo hi the contribution of the pressure term is u hi dp dx including this effect and using ct yields f mm now quite close to the value of mm obtained directly from the mean velocity profile note that these values of hi are of the same order than the original roughness of the surface without wind turbines mm when the pressure gradient is included in the formula the value obtained is even slightly smaller than mm which is not what is expected since the case with wind turbines should result in increased effective roughness scales the lack of separation of roughness length scales between the cases with and without wind turbines is due to various contributing factors the weak loading of the wind turbines already noted which makes their overall effect rather weak ii the rough bottom sandpaper surface which provides fairly large even without wind turbines iii the moderate reynolds number which introduces significant viscous effects in the bottom near wall behavior iv and the many uncertainties in evaluating hi due to the lack of log law above the wind turbines these limitations of the length scale ratios of the present study will be taken into account when designing followup experiments vertical flux of kinetic energy in this section we consider the results from the point of view of kinetic energy and power specifically we consider the integral version of the kinetic energy eq integrated vertically between yh and yh an important question is whether the difference between the flux of kinetic energy coming from the top and leaving at the bottom can provide sufficient kinetic energy to the wind turbines in very large array as seen in fig the region near the top of the turbine receives flux of around v xz xz yhi s from the upper parts of the flow while feeding about v xz xz ylo s to the regions below the wind turbine region at m therefore the net difference is about s which when multiplied by air density kg is net flux of m multiplying by the horizontal area sxszd associated with turbine in the array gives pflux the integral of the kinetic energy dissipation between yh and yh approximated from the data by integrating the profile of fig using trapezoidal rule is approximatelyploss sxszd yh yh u xz xz y the effect of the dispersive stress flux is small and can be neglected for the purpose of this discussion in order to quantify the power extraction produced by the turbines we apply method described in detail in ref briefly the target turbine motor is replaced with dc motor and mounted inside the hub on ball bearings so that it can in principle rotate freely in reaction to the applied torque from the rotor small arm with pin is attached to the dc motor and the pin presses against thin phosphorus bronze plate size of mm in length mm in width and mm in thickness mounted on the hub which prevents the motor from rotating the plate is instrumented with two miniature strain gages omega sgd ly calibration is done by hanging weights on an arm thus creating known torques that can be correlated to the measured voltage from the strain gages the wind turbine thus equipped with this torque measurement system is placed in the array loading the dc motor acting as generator with different electrical resistances its angular velocity can be varied and adjusted to be equal to that during the fluid dynamical measurements that were done earlier using the ac motors under the conditions of the experiment the measured torque was mnm which when multiplied by the measured angular velocity yields mechanical power extraction of pt incidentally this yields power coefficient of cp pt ufront which is reasonable when compared to the ideal value of deduced from the induction factor the overall balance of kinetic energy neglecting advection dispersive and the pressure terms is expected to bepflux ploss pt using our data pflux ploss which is of the same order of magnitude and larger than the value of pt measured directly from the torque on the turbine however we point out that there is possibly additional effects from the pressure gradient as discussed in sec a estimating the effect of pressure work using an assumed value of dp dx pa we obtainppres xz dp dxsxszd i of comparable magnitude as the other terms estimated from the data since the wind turbine array boundary layer in this study is not fully developed both the pressure gradient and advection terms including the gradient term in streamwise direction dx can affect the overall energy balance thus the overall balance of kinetic energy in eq does not necessarily hold in the developing boundary layer with the limited size of the wind turbine array nevertheless the main point of the analysis is that aside from the pressure gradient the vertical flux of kinetic energy due to turbulence v xz xz which enables kinetic energy to be entrained from aloft into the boundary layer towards the wind turbine is of sufficient magnitude to account for the observed kinetic energy extraction from the flow in this wind tunnel experimental study we have considered the horizontally averaged structure of boundary layer over an array of wind turbine models the study of such wind turbine array boundary layers is important to better understand the interplays between the atmosphere and arrays of wind turbines this becomes especially relevant as wind farms are becoming increasingly large previous studies have focused on the details of wake growth wake mergers superpositions etc while here the focus is on the large scale structure in conjunction with the boundary layer the variables of interest in this context are at this stage the horizontally averaged velocities and reynolds stresses it is argued that in principle dispersive stresses can also be responsible for exchanges of momentum and kinetic energy see also ref in order to measure all of these variables the distribution of the flow must be measured with sufficient accuracy the measurement results in the wind tunnel show that the dispersive stresses are fairly small compared to the reynolds stresses although in the near wake region they may contribute to wake recovery but this is canceled mostly by an opposite behavior in the frontal region of the flow the horizontally averaged structure of the flow can be understood using momentum theory in the sense that there is consistency between the friction velocities prevalent above the wind turbine region and below with the thrust coefficient from the turbines as result an estimate of the effective roughness of wind turbine canopy was obtained from the data due to the small boundary layer thickness in the experiment no equilibrium log layer was visible in the mean velocity profiles above the wind turbines however using the measured reynolds shear stress the friction velocity above the wind turbines could be estimated unambiguously assuming log law that passes through the measured mean velocity right above the wind turbines allowed an estimation of an effective roughness although its value must be considered to be very approximate two models for the effective roughness were compared with the data the formulation by frandsen et al and by lettau gave similar results both significantly larger than the measured value the frandsen approach is thought to be superior to that of lettau since it allows taking into account the thrust coefficient of wind turbines as well as the roughness height of the bottom surface or the bottom friction velocity as was done here the les results of ref also show the frandsen approach to lead to better results however in the presently lightly loaded wind turbine application the difference between the two approaches is small generalization of the frandsen formula to include effects of mean pressure gradient was considered and resulting effective roughness lengths agreed better with the approximate values obtained from the velocity measurements the measured values involved significant uncertainties due to the limitations of the length scale ratios of the present study these will be taken into account when designing followup experiments finally the data were analyzed from the point of view of kinetic energy the salient conclusion was that in an array interacting with turbulent boundary layer the vertical fluxes of mean kinetic energy associated with the streamwise velocity due to reynolds turbulent shear stresses are of the same order of magnitude as the power extracted by the wind turbines in fact in fully developed infinite array of wind turbines this becomes the dominant mechanism providing kinetic energy to the turbines it remains to be seen whether this can hold true also in the case of more strongly loaded wind turbines further experimental studies should be performed to consider larger arrays so that the conditions better resemble those of nearly fully developed wind turbine array boundary layers and detailed analysis of the data may also be useful to compare with the various wake boundary layer coupling models proposed in ref also by redesigning the rotor and by including more resistive load to the generator to induce larger induction factor and thrust coefficient stronger and more realistic couplings between wind turbines and the boundary layer may be studied furthermore the roughness of the bottom surface should be decreased g using finer grained sandpaper in order to accentuate the difference between the roughness heights with and without wind turbines  molybdenum disulfide mos is layered semiconductor which has become very important recently as an emerging electronic device material being an intrinsic semiconductor the two dimensional mos has major advantages as the channel material in field effect transistors in this work we determine the electronic structures of mos with the highly accurate screened hybrid functional within the density functional theory dft including the spin orbit coupling using the dft electronic structures as target we have developed single generic tight binding tb model that accurately produces the electronic structures for three different forms of mos bulk bilayer and monolayer our tb model is based on the slater koster method with non orthogonal sp orbitals nearest neighbor interactions and spin orbit coupling the tb model is useful for atomistic modeling of quantum transport in mos based electronic devices molybdenum disulfide mos belongs to family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides tmdc in which the layers are held together by weak van der waals forces and it can be exfoliated mechanically to single layer thickness in its bulk form mos is an indirect band gap semiconductor which turns into direct band gap semiconductor for monolayer structure this intrinsic semiconducting nature of mos is major advantage over graphene which has no intrinsic band gap as two dimensional channel material in field effect transistors fet indeed fet devices based on mos monolayer and bilayer have already been fabricated in the experimental labs and demonstrated to have useful device performances several theoretical studies of mos fet devices based on simplified description of the electronic structures within an effective mass model have also been reported recently due to the complex nature of the layered tmdc materials and the great interests in the electronics community for its applications in emerging devices more reliable accurate and atomistic treatment of the electronic structures of tmdc is desired since ab initio models are computationally expensive and often intractable for realistic device structures having large number of atoms widely applied intermediary option is the tight binding tb model tb models are atomistic full band yet computationally efficient due to the small number of basis orbitals and the rigid nature of the hamiltonian properly parameterized tb models have been extensively applied to predict reliable results for diverse range of devices including the resonant tunneling diodes quantum dots si nanowirefet and compound semiconductor heterostructures in this study we report generic tb model with non orthogonal sp orbitals including the nearest neighbour interactions and spin orbit coupling that accurately determines the electronic structures of bulk monolayer and bilayer mos reliable and accurate target band structure is the primary requirement for successful tight binding modeling for the calculations of the target band structures we employ density functional theory dft with the screened hybrid functional of heyd scuseria and ernzerhof hse that has been shown in the literature to produce accurate band gaps and reasonable effective masses for wide range of semiconductors our calculated band structures of mos from the self consistent dft hse shows excellent agreement with the available experimental data and compare well with other theoretical studies even though an accurate target band structure is obtained by dft hse it is nontrivial to develop generic tb model which can accurately capture electronic structures and effective masses of not only bulk mos but also its double layer and single layer forms for the layered tmdc structures there is thickness dependent interlayer interaction that significantly affects the electronic properties the tb model must capture these effects so as to be applicable to devices made of different layer thicknesses as shown below our generic tb model accurately produces the band structures for three different forms of mos bulk monolayer and bilayer the reported tb model can be easily extended to other mos structures of higher number of layers as well as other layered tmdc materials such as ws wse and mose the accuracy of our tb model is validated by comparing the band gaps and effective masses with our calculated ab initio results in our study all the dft hse calculations are performed using the projector augmented wave paw pseudopotential plane wave method as implemented in the vasp software package monkhorst pack scheme is adopted for the sampling of the brillouin zone with point meshes of for the bulk and for the two dimensional structures an energy cutoff of ev is used in plane wave basis set we also included the spin orbit coupling self consistently due to the presence of van der waals interaction which determines the interlayer distance in mos geometry optimization becomes quite tricky and complicated without the van der waals intereaction the lattice parameter vertical length of the unit cell is overestimated by large margin however it is not yet possible to include van der waals interaction in the hse calculations and it is an area of active research we therefore optimize the bulk crystal structure using the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe functional for which the van der waals interaction can be included explicitly by adopting the dft method we then use this optimized structure for the hse calculations the values of our optimized lattice parameters for bulk mos are and with layer thickness of s vertical distance although the value of parameter improves significantly with the dft method it is still overestimated by around compared to the experimental value it is well known fact that dft within the local density approximation lda or the generalized gradient approximation gga underestimates band gaps of semiconductors due to factors such as the self interactions this error can be minimized in the hse scheme of hybrid functional method by incorporating short range sr exact hartree fock hf exchange with the pbe functional screening parameter defines the range separation and is empirically set to hse scheme for both the hf and pbe parts in our calculations for mos we observe that the band gap energies vary significantly with the screening parameter for both the bulk and the structures we therefore decided to adjust the value of to fit the experimental band gap and an optimize value for is found to be which corresponds to an interaction range of for the sr nonlocal exchange note that single value of is used for all the three structures of mos bulk double layer and single layer namely the hse results presented here were all obtained using our calculated band structure results for mos are plotted in fig as observed in previous studies we also notice from our dft hse calculations that the monolayer mos has direct band gap at the point whereas an indirect band gap opens up due to the presence of interlayer interactions in the bilayer and the bulk structures although both bulk and bilayer mos have indirect band gaps the conduction band minima cbm are located at different points for bulk it is at point midpoint of and points and for bilayer it is at point similar behavior is observed in previous theoretical study for monolayer mos the splitting of the valence band maximum vbm at point is solely due to the spin orbit coupling soc whereas combination of soc and interlayer interactions is responsible for the vbm splitting in bulk and bilayer mos with the self consistent calculations of the spin orbit effects within the dft hse model we obtain split off value of mev for the vbm at point for monolayer mos which is comparable to the experimental value of mev the splitting of cbm due to soc is minimal around mev the calculated band gap energies for different transitions are presented in table our dft hse results show good agreement with the experimental data the values of effective masses at different band edges along different directions as presented in table ii also compare well with other available theoretical studies with the calculated dft hse band structures as target we employed the nanoskif software package to obtain set of tb parameters for the on site energies the slater koster energy integrals overlap integrals and the spin orbit splitting in our tb model we adopted non orthogonal basis set of sp orbitals considering only the nearest neighbour interactions the effects of spin orbit coupling is included through split off energy term set of parameters are optimized through the automated process built in nanoskif the root mean square deviation of the fitting is within mev the optimized tb parameters are listed in table iii note that this single set of tb parameters is capable of producing accurate band structures of all three different forms of mos the band structures obtained from our tb model are plotted in fig along with those obtained from dft hse the agreement in energies around both vbm and cbm for all three structures of mos is excellent fig shows the energy contours around the valence band maximum vbm and the conduction band minimum cbm for the monolayer mos again we observe excellent agreement in the shape of the energy contours from dft hse and tb fitting the band gap energies for different transitions and the effective mass values at different symmetry points obtained from the dft hse and the tb model are presented in table and table ii respectively for the band gap energies fitting accuracy of less than is achieved on the other hand for the effective masses in most cases the deviations between the dft hse and the tb values are less than which is quite acceptable in four cases excluding the monolayer structure the deviations are higher with the worst situation at given that just single set of tb parameters is used to produce the band structurues of all three different forms of the material this level of quantitative consistency is rather satisfactory in conclusion we have developed generic tb model for accurately calculating the band structures of bulk monolayer and bilayer mos our tb model is based on the slater koster method for the optimization of the tb parameters accurate target band structures are obtained using the screened hybrid dft method the accuracy of our tb model is verified by comparing the band gaps for different transitions and the effective masses at different band edges against the ab initio band structures one main feature of our tb model is that with only one set of parameters it can reproduce the band structures of mos of different structural configurations from bulk to structures our tight binding model can be easily extended to other tmdc materials that show electronic characteristics similar to mos the tb model reported in this paper is useful for simulations of quantum transport in nanoelectronic devices based on the tmdc materials  multi target pathogen detection using heterogeneous medical samples require continuous filtering sorting and trapping of debris bioparticles and immunocolloids within diagnostic chip we present an integrated ac dielectrophoretic dep microfluidic platform based on planar electrodes that form three dimensional dep gates this platform can continuously perform these tasks with throughput of min mixtures of latex particles escherichia coli nissle lactobacillus and candida albicans are sorted and concentrated by these dep gates surface enhanced raman scattering is used as an on chip detection method on the concentrated bacteria processing rate of bacteria was estimated when of heterogeneous colony of colony forming units ml was processed in single pass within min typically biomedical samples contain mixture of debris bacteria and other organisms creating heterogeneous matrix of bioparticles in order to isolate the target pathogen from this matrix expensive and large laboratory equipment must be used such as centrifuge the centrifuge can effectively separate undesired materials that differ in size and mass but bioparticles are similar in size and composition and require higher speeds and longer centrifugation times however at these speeds cells and bacteria can be damaged or ripped open due to the strong centrifugal force needed for this type of separation once the target pathogen is isolated the concentrations are typically low and require time consuming culturing steps to reach concentrations high enough for detection despite the time and labor costs for centrifuging and culturing samples these methods still remain the gold standards for pathogen detection modern immunoassay techniques like agglutination utilize antibody functionalized immunocolloids to trap or detect specific bacteria thus eliminating or reducing culturing requirements lab on chip devices strive to integrate and miniaturize these bioparticle filtering sorting trapping and detecting processes into continuous flow chip scale device that can reduce labor and equipment needs and yet process realistic sample volume within reasonable duration for typical medical sample with more than one million bacteria ml this translates into need for processing more than bacteria current sorting technologies for integrated chips typically use electrokinetic and hydrodynamic forces on the particle they rely on the principle that with the same applied electric or flow field different pathogens experience different particle forces and can then be directed to different positions on the chip for example field flow fractionation is based on the differences in the size or density of the bioparticle therefore it is insensitive to bacteria that are roughly of the same size and density particular electrokinetic method that is pathogen sensitive and is not damaging to the bioparticle itself is ac dielectrophoresis particle in nonuniform electric field will form an induced dipole based on the relative permittivity of the particle and the surrounding medium the movement of the particle to regions of high low field due to this induced polarization is termed dielectrophoresis dep bioparticle dep effects are highly sensitive to the dimension shape conductivity and permittivity of the cell interior and cell membrane which vary widely for different species live dead and diseased bacteria cells moreover this selective sensitivity can be tuned by adjusting the ac frequency and the conductivity of the solution for example live and dead bacteria have been shown to migrate by dep forces to different regions on the chip at the same frequency because of the change in their ion channel activity dep separation by size and shape of the bacteria can be adjusted by altering the condition of the medium or by forming conductivity gradients continuous flow dep devices that have been used to sort cells include electrical field flow fractionation fff trapezoidal electrode arrays and dep deflection however as the dep traps are typically planar electrodes their field gradient penetration depth is limited by the electrode gap more importantly the field intensity gradient is mostly in the direction normal to the through flow and therefore cannot be used effectively to counter stokes drag as result these inefficient dep traps and sorters require long channels and low flow rates thus severely limiting the throughput recent work has tried to overcome the low trapping efficiency of planar dep traps and sorters by combining hydrodynamic and electrokinetic methods to sort bacteria optical detection is used to actively direct the flow to specific channels and pinched flow fractionization design has been reported however the insensitivity of cells bacteria and viruses to hydrodynamic sorting effects still reduce the selectivity of these faster devices using series of interdigitated castellated electrodes alternating flow directions and electrode activation can separate live dead yeast cells in continuous flow system however due to the drop off of the dep force in the bulk with respect to the electrode surface and the scaling of the particle radius with relation to the dep force a small particle can only be affected by dep when it is in close proximity of the electrode surface dep has also been used to concentrate bacteria but the speed of this process is again limited by the short range and normal field gradient direction of planar dep electrodes by combining converging flow field near the stagnation point of an internal recirculation flow driven by ac electro osmosis longer range and faster trapping onto planar electrodes can be achieved however robust through flow would still severely limit their trapping efficiency promising solution to the low efficiency of planar dep traps in through flow is to use three dimensional electrode system where the electrodes are fabricated on the top and bottom of the channel the configuration produces dep gate whose field spans the entire height of the channel and whose field gradient and dep force field intensity gradient is exactly against the flow direction these gates used in continuous flow device can be used to direct and deflect particles to specific regions on the chip or trap the particles however the alignment and bonding of the top and bottom electrodes is difficult and has prevented many dep techniques from adapting to this configuration the aligning can be done using microscope however the bonding of the chip once the electrodes are aligned creates additional difficulties bonding the chips by heat is undesirable because the electrodes and the chip would be removed from the microscope causing the alignment to shift gluing the electrodes together also is difficult because along with aligning excess glue can contaminate the channel or an unevenly coated surface will cause some areas to be glued while others are not thus using planar electrodes on one side of the chip is less time consuming and is often used in dep chips to our knowledge due to these technical obstacles an integrated dep chip for continuous filtering focusing sorting and trapping of bacteria has not been reported in the literature after the bacteria are sorted and concentrated their identity must be determined by an on chip or an external sensor for lab on chip devices the current identification methods include micro pcr impedance and immunocolloids while impedance spectroscopy cannot offer species identification it can quantify the amount of bacteria that are trapped for immunoassays micron and nanometer sized particles are functionalized with antibodies to be used as immunocolloids however to reduce the transport time for colloid pathogen docking large number of immunocolloids must be utilized thus the sorting and detection of colloids with and without docked pathogens then becomes the technological challenge micro pcr can identify the species but it is unable to quantify and detect live dead cells fluorescence labeling and specific genetic sequence labeling have also been used as detection methods however these methods require multiple steps to prepare the sample for detection such as washing separating and setting specific temperature sequences these preparatory sequences create additional processing steps that need to be developed for an on chip device in contrast detection method that has minimal preparatory sequences and has been used for on chip detection is spectroscopy such as infrared ir ultraviolet and visible uv vis and raman spectroscopy ir and raman spectroscopy measure the vibrational modes of the molecules and the various structures thus providing detailed spectrum in particular raman spectroscopy can often show bonds that are undetectable through ir thus it has been shown to be extremely specific to each bacterium where each spectrum can act as fingerprint additionally no preparatory steps are needed for raman spectroscopy and the sample can be scanned while the bacteria are concentrating recent advances and applications have shown the range of characterization abilities for raman detection of amino acids dna bacteria live dead yeast cells and tumor nontumor cells raman scattering is very weak effect where only in photons that scatter result in raman scatter thus high concentrations of bacteria are required for detection advances in raman spectroscopy have led to the development of surface enhanced raman scattering sers sers uses mixture of the sample and metal nanoparticle nm to enhance the intensity of the raman scatter of the molecule the metal nanoparticles must be either chemically bonded to the bacteria or settle in the proximity of the bacteria in order to increase the scattering this advancement has allowed for more detailed spectra at lower concentrations and faster scanning times currently the fastest scanning time reported is however high bacteria concentrations were used chemical agents and nucleic material have also been further characterized using sers in this study we designed an integrated chip see fig that allowed continuous flow bioparticle filtering focusing sorting trapping and detecting by using dep forces and sers the bioparticles were sorted by deflecting them into individual channels by angled electrodes based on their negative dep mobilities in the individual channels negative dep electrode gate was used to trap and concentrate the sorted bioparticles for further detection by sers the frequency ranges of positive and negative dep were found experimentally for each bacterium so that they could be sorted based on these frequencies different dep trap geometries shown in fig were examined and an arrowhead design was found to be the optimal latex particles candida albicans sepsis causing yeast cell coli nissle and lactobacillus gastrointestinal bacteria were focused sorted and trapped with this integrated chip as the bacteria were trapped their raman spectrum was taken simultaneously and enhanced by the addition of silver nanoparticles about samples were processed in min corresponding to the analysis of about particles electrode dep we used high frequency ac field such that there was little double layer screening at the electrode and the force from the dep electrodes was more effective thus we operated at frequencies above mhz however the dep force on the particle must be negative for the electrodes to deflect the particles toward channels on the chip and thus requires careful design and selection of operating conditions under nonuniform ac electric field particle that is more easily polarized than the surrounding medium will be attracted toward the region of highest field however if the particle is less polarized than the medium the particle will be repelled from the high field region this attraction toward the high field region is termed positive dielectrophoresis pdep while the repulsion from the high field region is termed negative dielectrophoresis ndep the time averaged dep force fdep mr re fcm is dependent on the permittivity of the medium the radius of the particle the clausius mossotti cm factor fcm and the magnitude of the electric field gradient if the value of re fcm is positive the particle exhibits positive dep properties and if the value of the re fcm is negative the particle exhibits negative dep properties however if fcm the corresponding frequency defines the crossover frequency where the particle exhibits neither nor dep properties the cm factor is defined by fcm m m where and are the complex permittivities of the particle and the medium respectively and can be defined as where is the conductivity of the medium and is the frequency of the applied field it is clear that the permittivity effects dominate at high frequencies and the conductivity effects dominate at relatively low frequencies the permittivity of cells is typically higher than that of the medium and therefore undesirable pdep typically occurs at frequencies higher than mhz to remedy this we employed high conductivity buffer much higher than the particle conductivity to produce very high cross over frequency such that ndep was still observed at the highest frequencies mhz of commercial power supplies as such there was little double layer screening of the electric field and yet the particles still exhibited ndep under the ndep working conditions we employed where the frequency was far lower than the cross over frequency the cm factor was real and roughly fcm using the electrode width which is typically to estimate the lateral field penetration length and d to estimate the field where is the peak to peak voltage and the channel height the dep force on any particle can be estimated as fdep mr d that acts in the direction normal to the electrode edge consider particle that has been trapped by an oblique gate with an inclination angle of as shown in fig since we are considering ndep gate the same electrode configuration is located on the top and the bottom of the channel however for simplicity we only consider d case where we have top view of the chip to study the effect of the shape of the ndep electrode gates the particle cannot penetrate the gate and pass through the channel due to the dep force but can translate along the edge of the gate toward the tip at the center the stokes drag on the particle which is in the flow direction must be countered by the projection of the dep force in the flow direction fdepsin to arrest penetration across the gate the linear flow velocity must be lower than the critical value of vc mr d sin for particle with radius of an applied field of vp a channel height of an electrode width of and an inclination angle of the corresponding critical velocity is roughly mm this corresponds to the linear velocity in the flow direction at the normal position of the particle if the particle transit time v where is the length of the channel and the average liquid linear velocity is much smaller than the sedimentation time tsed vsed then the relevant velocity is roughly the average linear liquid velocity or the velocity at the middle of the channel otherwise the particles would settle to the bottom of the chip and reduce the particle throughput this imposes the condition that l vsed for settling to be negligible where the sedimentation velocity vsed g s is negligible for micron and submicron particles despite the large aspect ratio d larger debris with significant settling can however be readily filtered as they experience lower drag at the bottom of the channel thus the velocities vc and d vsed bound the operating velocities of the chip we have designed our chip to operate at roughly mm the critical velocity decreases with inclined gates however for the sorter electrodes with an oblique angle of about the critical velocity was only reduced by factor of more problematic was the trap design of fig where larger inclination must be introduced to concentrate the particles in the middle of the channel and much lower velocity must be used however slot velocity profile decays rapidly in boundary layer of thickness near the side walls hence the largest inclination can be introduced within these side boundary layers as shown in fig beyond the boundaries the inclination should be reduced to about to prevent leakage and yet produce healthy migration to the tip of the electrode the design of the tip of the trap can also be optimized it is known that electric field lines tend to be compressed near corners so much so that even infinitely high fields and field gradients are possible near sharp corners in fig d finite element simulation of the laplace equation for an arrowhead and horizontal electrode geometry show much higher field for the sharp arrow head geometry the simulation was done under the conditions of deionized di water where the applied field to the electrodes was vp the field penetration depth of versus beyond the wide electrode was nearly twice as high for the arrowhead design this suggests an enhanced dep force at the tip that can be used to collect more particles with the arrowhead design the constant potential condition on the electrode was justifiable because at the mhz frequency we use there was very little double layer screening at the electrode the entire integrated chip contained single channel with height of m width of mm and length of cm from inlet to outlet hole shown in figs and labeled with the four different stages filtering focusing sorting and trapping the first parallel arrays of planar electrodes near the inlet were used to filter debris from the sample by removing particles that exhibit pdep this design is similar to interdigitated electrodes that are used in dep separation however we use d gate where the electrodes are on the top and bottom of the channel to enhance the trapping in the entire height of the channel if these particles were left in the sample they would be attracted to the electrodes and become barrier for other particles by distorting the flow field and the electric field as the mixture passed through the array pdep particles were attracted and trapped to the electrode while ndep particles passed through the electrode array the second stage contains two types of planar electrodes used for focusing both electrodes used ndep force to direct the particles toward the center of the channel the first pair was used as coarser focusing unit which brought the particles from the entire mm channel to width of while the second interdigitated electrodes was used for finer focusing process and brought the particles to region of which formed single line of particles such focusing section is important as each particle to be processed must be sorted under identical environments as the flow field and the electric field vary over the channel the particles should ideally be focused to the same spot to produce effective sorting once the particles were focused toward the center of the channel they were sorted into three individual channels by three oblique dep gates that did not span the entire channel they directed and deflected the bacteria to specific channels by using ndep conditions specific to each bacterium as shown in the diagram in fig at the first electrode all the particles were deflected by the oblique electrode but at the second electrode pair only particle was not deflected and traveled toward the bottom channel particles and were both deflected to the third electrode where was deflected again toward the center channel and passed through into the top most channel the fourth and final stage of the integrated chip was used to trap and concentrate the particles as they were being sorted unlike an electrode straight across the channel we designed an electrode to optimally counter stokes drag and trap and concentrate the particles as shown in the chip image in fig the final electrodes in each channel have different shapes an arrowhead crescent and flower all trapping electrodes are tuned to the frequency that all the bacteria would exhibit ndep to act as gate and prevent the bacteria from passing through the electrode pair however due to the high flow rate and the strength of the dep force some bacteria would pass through the electrode therefore the different electrode designs were used to test their trapping efficiency the crescent electrodes should slowly focus the particles toward the center leaving large regions at the tip of the electrode for the particles to concentrate the flower electrode due to the multiple curves should allow the particles to first trap in one curve and as they slow down due to the ndep force the particles would concentrate in the final curve at the tip of the electrode the arrowhead electrode was designed to focus the bacteria to the tip of the electrode and to trap at the sharp tip au cr electrodes nm nm thick were deposited on glass slide kimble mm by an electrobeam evaporator beam vt ce ulvac negative photoresist az was spin coated on the deposited metal layer and patterned by standard photolithography techniques with the electrode geometry the metal layer was then etched and the remaining photoresist removed after electrode patterning each slide was cleaned by acetone and isopropanol photosensitive epoxy based photoresist su was spin coated on one slide following standard lithography techniques of exposure and developing channel was patterned into the su with height of a width of mm and length of mm the three branch channels are in width and mm in length the inlet and outlet holes were drilled by diamond drill into second electrode patterned slide uv curable adhesive glue loctite with viscosity of cp was spin coated onto the slide with the su layer leaving m thick coating of glue when the glue was spin coated on the chip it did not enter the channel because of the surface tension of the glue the two electrode slides were aligned by microscope pressed together and exposed to uv to cure the bonding of the two slides together after applying pressure the adhesive layer was found to be less than thick to prevent the glue from entering the channel when pressure was applied to the two slides small groove was patterned on the outer edges of the desired channel to ensure none of the glue entered the channel the common method used to bond slides with uv glue is to inject the glue into the chip edge and rely on capillary action to spread the glue however the channel is often contaminated by this method by spinning the glue on the chip and fabricating groove contamination of the channel is prevented allowing for fast and clean bonding method the fabrication process is illustrated in the schematic in fig an applied function generator wavetek was used to reach an output voltage range of mvp to vp with frequency range of to mhz and can output four different signals simultaneously the sample was injected continuously into the microchannel by microsyringe pump through teflon tube the experiment was observed through an inverted microscope olympus ch and recorded by ccd camera depiction of the experimental setup is shown in fig an additional microscope and imaging system was used an olympus inverted microscope and an speed cdu camera system olympus usa an applied function generator tektronix cfg was used to reach voltages up to vp and frequencies up to mhz along with second function generator agilent that can to reach voltages up to vp and frequencies up to mhz renishaw raman microscope with nm laser and silver nanoparticles nm made as described in the procedure by lee and meisel were used for sers detection fluorescent latex particles sigma aldrich usa ranging from to suspended in di water at concentrations of particles ml were used for imaging each process of the integrated chip albicans was obtained from the department of medical laboratory sciences and biotechnology at the national cheung kung university in tainan taiwan the yeast sample was grown in sda synthetic defined agar for at the albicans was then suspended in mm kcl solution to reach concentration of colony forming units cfu ml with conductivity of m heat killed albicans min were dyed with trypan blue and suspended in mm kcl solution coli nissle and the lactobacillus were obtained from the university of chicago pritzker school of medicine the coli was grown in tryptic soy broth and lactobacillus was grown in mrs deman rogosa sharpe medium both bacteria were grown for at temperature of samples of cfu ml of each bacterium were suspended in mixture of saline and mannitol sigma aldrich usa solution to reach conductivities ranging from mto m as compared to the typical conductivity of ms for saline solutions the dep behaviors were first characterized by varying the frequencies from khzto mhz at fixed voltage to map the dep properties highly concentrated solution of single bacterium cfu ml was placed on top of planar electrode array as drop and the motion of the bacteria was observed under an ac field the trapping location of bacteria on the electrode edge or between the electrodes indicated whether the bacteria exhibited positive or negative dep at that applied frequency at low frequencies mhz all the bacteria and the yeast exhibited ndep in the conductive medium with conductivity beyond m and were trapped in the electrode gaps as the frequencies were increased the bacteria reached their cross over and were attracted to the electrode edges by pdep however these preliminary cross over frequency estimates were repeated within the chip under flow conditions as detailed in the following section dep the frequency ranges of ndep and pdep were experimentally determined for the albicans lactobacillus and coli nissle slow flow rate of min linear velocity mm was used so that the bacteria would not pass through the filtering stage too fast for the dep properties to be tested at voltage of vp the frequency across the parallel electrodes was slowly increased until the dep directions of the particles changed the latex particle exhibited pdep at frequencies below khz and ndep above this frequency the latex particles exhibited ndep at all frequencies above khz for suspension conductivity of m the coli was found to exhibit strong ndep at frequencies below mhz and strong pdep above mhz while lactobacillus exhibited strong ndep at frequencies below mhz and strong pdep properties above mhz the albicans was found to exhibit pdep above mhz at vp while heat killed albicans stayed at ndep through the entire frequency range mixture of live and dead albicans was passed through the filter under an applied field of vp and frequency of mhz the live cells were trapped at the filter electrodes while the dead cells passed through the electrode array unaffected the live albicans trapped on the parallel electrode are shown in fig in the next stage of the chip fluorescent latex particles were seen being deflected toward the center of the channel indicated by the light streak between the electrodes in both images of figs and these images are enhanced in the supplemental material the particle velocity was roughly mm through the channel under an applied voltage of vp and frequency of mhz the first set of focusing electrodes is shown in fig where the particles are confined to region of approximately however there are multiple streaks indicating that there were many particles passing through the gap between the focusing electrodes in fig the secondary focusing array of interdigitated electrodes are shown where the particles are confined to much smaller area and individual particles are seen passing through the electrode gap in single line this single file queue for the particles is sustained in the remainder of the chip until the trapping stage if debris filtering is unnecessary the downstream focusing sorting and trapping can be done at flow rate of min linear velocity mm for typical sample this corresponds to processing time of min recall that the dep force scales as thus larger particles will experience stronger ndep force than smaller particles and should therefore be deflected more readily mixture of and latex particles in an applied field of vp and mhz was pumped through the chip the particles were indeed deflected by the sorting electrodes while the particles passed through the electrodes with only minor deflections in fig after the mixture of particles are focused to single line the latex particles are seen to the left of the electrode pair traveling along the length of the electrodes as they are deflected while the particles pass through the electrodes into channel this image is enhanced as video in the supplemental material along with sorting by size different bacteria exhibit different dep properties in s solution at vp and mhz lactobacillus has strong ndep force while at the same frequency coli is near its cross over frequency the deflection due to the electrodes was minimal for the coli and was seen passing through the electrodes lactobacillus was deflected along the electrode like the latex particles and continued through the channel after traveling the length of the electrodes as seen in fig thus the electrodes can be used to sort mixtures of bacteria into various channels and can be further scaled to accommodate larger number of bacteria mixtures with linear particle velocity of s this translates into about particles being processed per second this number is consistent with the product of the typical sample volume and bacteria concentration cfu ml divided by the typical processing time min the final electrodes on the integrated chip were used to trap and concentrate the bacteria once they were separated into their individual channels as the coli and lactobacillus were being sorted they were trapped in the arrowhead and the crescent electrode respectively as seen in figs and in both electrode designs large fraction of the bacteria was trapped however the amount of coli trapped in the crescent electrode was considerably less than the lactobacillus the two different electrodes configurations were trapping at different rates as expected from the analysis of fig from the image of the chip in fig three trapping electrode designs were used however only two designs were found to be effective in trapping and concentrating the arrowhead and the crescent shaped electrode the trapping rate for both of these configurations was rapid as seen in the sequence of images of the crescent electrodes in fig taken at intervals this image is enhanced in the supplemental material to show the trapping rate of the arrowhead electrode sample of latex particles was trapped with an applied field of vp at frequency of mhz the particles can be seen being deflected by the electrode and directed toward the concentrated particles by the streaks in the image however particles can be seen passing through the electrodes suggesting that the trapping electrode cannot prevent all the particles from passing through the channel this may be due to the particle particle interaction and the varying vertical position of the particles the trapping electrode regime can also become saturated with particles at high concentrations and prevent particles from trapping at the electrode once the particles have packed together at the trapping electrode and settled to the bottom they will affect the flow above them and force the particles to flow higher in the channel and not through the optimal region of ndep in the electrode gate the trapping efficiency of the two electrode designs was compared to horizontal electrode gate the flow rate and the voltage required to successfully trap particles using the crescent arrowhead and horizontal electrodes were measured and plotted in fig as expected the arrowhead electrode can trap at higher flow rates and at lower voltages this is most likely due to the tip of the arrowhead because the sharp angle of the arrowhead electrode increases the electric field as seen from the simulation in fig allowing for stronger ndep effect on the particles while the crescent electrode slowly curves the particles toward the center of the channel and the particles are seen to migrate toward the concentrated slug the field at this tip is not as strong as the field due to sharp angle another criterion that is considered in the trapping efficiency of the electrodes is the amount of particles that leak through the electrodes latex particles at flow rate of min mm and vp were trapped in both the arrowhead and the crescent electrodes and the area of the particles trapped was measured over time of the resulting area versus time was plotted in fig the horizontal electrode was not considered because it cannot trap at high flow rates as can be seen in the images the trapping area of the arrowhead electrode is much greater than that of the crescent indicating that fewer particles were leaking through the arrowhead electrode with the small channel height of and suspension consisting of particles the piling effect of the particles once they were stopped was relatively low and it occurred for both electrode systems thus we can see that the arrowhead electrode is better trapping electrode not only because it increases the field effect on the particles by the sharp electrode tip but also utilizes the profile of the flow field to maximize the ndep effect on the particles as it enters into the channel as the bioparticles were trapped at the crescent and arrowhead electrodes concentrated slug was found on the glass slide as seen in the previous images within this slug the concentration is extremely high and can be used for raman detection mixture comprised of of nm silver nanoparticles and ml of cfu ml of coli is trapped at the electrodes in an applied field of vp at frequency of khz focusing the laser onto the concentrated slugs through one of the glass slides of the enclosed chip raman spectrum was taken of the concentrated slugs min after sorting commenced the resulting spectrum of coli is shown in blue in fig using an integration time of with one accumulation step similar experiment with the same conditions was used for obtaining the red spectrum of the lactobacillus in fig the two bacteria spectra have very distinct peaks and distinct spectra list of some of their similar peaks and possible corresponding bonds is shown in fig current databases are still compiling raman spectrum and characterization information on bacteria and other micro organisms due to their complex exterior there are many proteins and amino acids that are common in more cell walls and cell membranes however their interactions with other molecules orientations and quantities still differ in producing very distinct and different raman spectra thus the integrated chip is equipped to accommodate raman detection of the bacteria and can be used as quantification and identification method with the concentrated slug at the traps we have fabricated continuous integrated chip that can filter focus sort and trap heterogeneous bioparticle and colloid populations on single chip at rate of particles these processes were achieved with electrode gates that utilize different ndep mobilities of the bacteria and other particles in high conductivity buffer to manipulate them within the channel the trapping electrode utilized special design that exploits the strength of the electric field at sharp electrode corners and the low flow rate at the side of the channels the arrowhead electrode design was found to be the most effective in trapping and concentrating particles at high velocity of mm we have successfully sorted and concentrated sepsis causing yeast albicans and two gastrointestinal bacteria coli nissle and lactobacillus and have identified the latter two by raman spectroscopy sorting and identification can be done in less than min for l sample this rapid sorting of large volume of sample suggests that the chip can be scaled up to accommodate finer sorting into more bins than three and that much more complex matrix can be processed at higher efficiencies with recycling or higher number of sorting and filtering stages trapped particles can also be released in stages to examine different particles with crossover frequencies over wide range these massively parallel chips are currently being pursued in our laboratories  we report on the patterning of organic single crystal transistors with high device performance fabricated via solution process under ambient conditions the semiconductor was patterned on substrates via surface selective deposition subsequently solvent vapor annealing was performed to reorganize the semiconductor into single crystals the transistors exhibited field effect mobility fet of up to cm s good reliability under bias stress conditions indicates low density of intrinsic defects in crystals and low density of traps at the active interfaces furthermore the function method clearly suggests that the variation of fet of organic crystal transistors was caused by contact resistance further improvement of the device with higher fet with smaller variation can be expected when lower and more uniform contact resistance is achieved the application of organic field effect transistors ofets in next generation electronic products has been the subject of intensive interest due to simple fabrication low cost and large area significant number of studies in this field have considered organic single crystals oscs as ideal materials for devices with the highest performance due to their highly ordered molecules grain boundaries and molecular disorder in amorphous or polycrystalline thin films limit the charge transport by scattering charge carriers the absence of these scattering centers is the principal advantage of oscs the reported values of carrier mobility are over one order of magnitude higher in oscs than those in ofets made of polycrystalline semiconductors despite the reported high mobility of osc transistors numerous factors limit their application one is the difficulty in the patterning of osc transistors which is beneficial for the reduction of parasitic current paths crosstalk between neighboring devices in thin film transistors simple patterning of the active semiconductor layer is carried out via shadowmasking for oscs hand picking and placing individual crystals is the most common approach however this process limits the potential industrial application of oscs and lowers device performance due to the introduction of contamination and crystal damage recently patterning of vapor grown organic crystals by controlling the nucleation location has been reported the field effect mobility fet is over cm s based on rubrene single crystals in comparison device performance of solution processed osc transistors on patterned substrates is considerably lower therefore patterning solution processed osc transistors with device performance comparable to that of the vapor sublimed devices remains challenge in the present work self assembled monolayer sam was grown on sio si substrate and selectively exposed to uv ozone to form patterned wettability the type organic semiconductor dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene btbt was subsequently deposited from solution mixed with polymer dielectric of polymethylmethacrylate pmma the patterned films were treated with solvent vapor annealing sva under ambient conditions such as exposure of the functional materials to saturated solvent vapor to allow partial dissolution and recrysallization the resulting transistors exhibited fet of up to cm s in the saturation regime of the transfer characteristics the devices also showed good reliability in bias stress measurement suggesting low density of localized states at the active regions for the oscs via the sva process our results demonstrated an easy and efficient solution processed method of patterning oscs for transistors application with high device performance moreover further analysis on the device performance showed that the field effect mobility is highly dependent on contact resistance the molecular structures of the materials used are shown in fig including tridecafluoro tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane fts pmma and btbt the fabrication process for the patterned osc transistors is illustrated in fig pre cleaned sio nm si substrate was immersed overnight in the fts solution with chloroform in glove box with nitrogen atmosphere the fts lowered the surface energy of substrate dramatically and achieved water contact angle of approximately compared to the angle of the bare sio si substrate after cleaning by ultrasonication in chloroform acetone and isopropanol the substrate with fts was covered with shadowmask and subjected to uv ozone treatment for min the treatment resulted in partial removal of the hydrophobic fts layer and formation of hydrophilic square areas mm without fts coating subsequently the mixture solution of btbt wt and pmma wt in anisole was spin coated onto the substrate with patterned wettability due to the wettability difference small droplets were confined in the square regions without fts and formed film arrays after spin coating resulting in selective deposition in desired geometry c btbt and pmma double layer was formed due to phase separation which conforms to the result of previous study subsequently the as spun film arrays with polycrystalline btbt were annealed with chloroform saturated vapor under ambient conditions at room temperature and reorganized into single crystals via self assembly as critical factor in the formation of btbt crystals during the sva process pmma provides high molecular mobility to facilitate rearrangement of btbt molecules over large distance on the substrate the previous study showed that resulting oscs are located on the thin polymeric dielectric pmma film approximately nm thus an osc dielectrics structure can be formed spontaneously during the sva process this suggests that our method could be further applied in devices used for simple fabrication with lower cost figs and shows the formation of btbt crystals within the patterned regions after the sva process the crystals exhibited strong birefringence under the cross polarized microscope fig confirming their crystalline nature previous studies have shown that btbt crystals are in the face centered cubic unit cells with growth orientation along the crystal direction finally moox and au were thermally evaporated through shadowmask to form the source and drain electrodes approximately of the patterns on the substrate were with the oscs that are bridging the source and drain electrodes the transfer and output curves of typical osc transistor are shown in figs and respectively the figure shows the negligible hysteresis in both curves besides the gate leakage current is in the region of to the field effect mobility fet was extracted from the saturation regime with the capacitance of cm nm pmma on nm sio the fet yielded saturation regime mobility of cm s with an on off ratio greater than the threshold voltage vt and sub threshold swing were and dec respectively such high mobility results from highly ordered semiconducting molecules in the conducting channel allowing efficient charge transport along the crystal growth orientation as vt and are determined mainly by the density and distribution of the traps in the active area the small vt and indicate low trap density at the semiconductor dielectrics interface figure shows the output characteristics of the device and reveals its good field effect transistor behavior consequently the results show that our method is an efficient approach for patterning osc transistors with high device performance which is comparable to the patterned transistors based on the vapor phase deposited organic crystals such as rubrene and pentacene compared with devices with oscs obtained from the natural drying solution the significant improvement in the performance of our device is due to the fact that the sva process allows longer and more controllable time for reorganization and recrystallization leading to higher degree of molecular order despite the featured high performance the devices showed variation in fet ranging from to cm s this variation has been reported in fets with other oscs and is attributed to the anisotropy of charge transport influence of channel traps and variation in contact resistance in our devices the effect of anisotropy was less apparent because the carriers transport preferentially in the crystal direction however the influence of channel traps as defects of btbt crystals and at the active interfaces were probably introduced during the sva process under ambient conditions such intrinsic defects could trap the mobile charge carriers in the channel shifting vt under prolonged operation in on condition and lowering device reliability thus we carried out the bias stress measurement in vacuum and excluded the influence of water and oxygen from ambient conditions during electrical measurement in fig a slight shift of the transfer curve to negative is observed even after application of stress of gate voltage for and even when the off current remained at very low level the drain current managed to keep approximately of the initial value and the shift of vt vt was only after bias stress measurement for fig as result fet extracted from each transfer curve was maintained within small range of magnitude fig and remained as high as cm s after the entire bias stress measurement this reliability indicates that charge trapping in pre existing or stress generated deep localized states in osc bulk and at the dielectric interfaces is limited despite the fabrication under ambient conditions with oxygen and water moreover as reported in polycrystalline ofets charge trapping into the deep trap states at the grain boundary in the metal semiconductor contact region could also bring about bias stress instability however in our osc transistors the density of trap states in the contact regions was less than the organic polycrystalline surface moreover the discrepancy between the initial fet in the bias stress test and that in the device performance measurement could be due to the influence of ambient environment on the top surface of organic crystals because the bias stress test was carried out more than twenty days after the device performance was measured however when the device was measured several months after the bias stress test it still showed good device performance with the extracted fet close to cm s it indicates that the present device exhibits long term stability in performance after slight degradation as shown above the intrinsic defects from the sva process and the stress generated localized states in the channel region are limited this suggests that the variation of field effect mobility is highly dependent on contact resistance to evaluate contact effects we applied the function method yfm the method was established for silicon metal oxide semiconductor fets mosfets and has been applied recently in ofets to estimate contact resistance and low field mobility from individual devices contact resistance includes resistance at the metal organic interface and access resistance from metal semiconductor interface to the conducting channel moreover characterizes the intrinsic carrier mobility as the maximum available mobility in real transistors assuming the contact resistance is equal to zero in the yfm the function is defined as documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation frac d sqrt

compared to the effective values thus contact resistance can be estimated from the slopes of the plots of vg and gm vg when the drain voltage is low to set the device in the linear regime in fig the value of fet vd saturation regime is significantly lower than in each individual device and generally decreases with the increase in contact resistance as the calculated values are at the same level the variation of fet comes mainly from contact resistance although the channel resistance shows certain variation the variation in the contact resistance can be due to the different osc thicknesses influencing access resistance hence with further improvement aimed at achieving lower and more uniform contact resistance ofets that exhibit higher fet with smaller variation can be produced in conclusion we have demonstrated method for patterning osc transistors using surface selective deposition the btbt oscs were formed through sva under ambient conditions the devices exhibited typical transistor behavior and the highest fet reached cm s good reliability under bias stress measurement suggests that the density of the intrinsic defects in the crystals and the density of traps at the active interfaces are limited further analysis on device performance showed that fet was influenced by the contact resistance for further improvement and future application in real devices several technical requirements such as controllable orientation alignment of the organic crystals in patterned areas with lower and more uniform contact resistance are desirable such progress is based on deeper understanding of the growth mechanism of osc of which we are currently conducting study on  the performance of perovskite solar cells recently exceeded solar to electricity conversion efficiency for small area devices the fundamental properties of the active absorber layers hybrid organic inorganic perovskites formed from mixing metal and organic halides g nh pbi and ch nh pbi are largely unknown the materials are semiconductors with direct band gaps at the boundary of the first brillouin zone the calculated dielectric constants and band gaps show an orientation dependence with low barrier for rotation of the organic cations due to the electric dipole of the methylammonium cation photoferroic effect may be accessible which could enhance carrier collection progress in the performance of hybrid pervoskite solar cells has rapidly advanced over the last five years they represent the convergence of inorganic thin film and dye sensitised solar cells the conversion efficiencies have quickly surpassed both those of conventional dye cells as well as next generation thin film absorbers such as cu znsns despite their high performance for small area cm cells the underlying material properties are largely unknown which could help with producing more robust large area devices perovskite refers to the crystal structure of the mineral catio which is adopted by large family of abx materials with two notable examples being srtio and batio figure they are well known for their phase complexity with accessible cubic tetragonal orthorhombic trigonal and monoclinic polymorphs depending on the tilting and rotation of the bx polyhedra in the lattice phase transitions are frequently observed under the influence of temperature pressure and or applied electric field while oxide perovskites abo are formed from divalent aii site cuboctahedral and tetravalent biv site octahedral metals halide perovskites g abi can be formed from monovalent ai and divalent bii metals for example the application of cssni in solar cells has recently been demonstrated hybrid organic inorganic perovskites are produced by replacing one of the inorganic cations by an isovalent molecule g cssni nh sni where documentclass pt minimal begin document rm nh end document nh is the ammonium cation recently the methylammonium ma cation e ch nh has been widely applied resulting in the highest performance perovskite structured photovoltaic absorbers more generally large series of hybrid perovskites have been reported which vary in their dimensionality and the orientation of the underlying perovskite lattice in this letter we assess the properties of the two archetypal hybrid perovskites nh pbi and ch nh pbi using density functional theory dft for the ground state properties and density functional perturbation theory dfpt for the dielectric and optical response functions we provide insights into the key properties required for device models and screening procedures and that underpin their utility in photovoltaic cells characterisation of the crystal structures of inorganic perovskites is difficult and hybrid perovskites are even more challenging recent analysis of high quality ma pbi crystals identified cubic documentclass pt minimal begin document pm bar end document pm tetragonal mcm and orthorhombic pnam phases from ray diffraction while transmission electron microscopy suggested pseudo cubic behaviour that is consistent with variability in the octahedral titling and or rotations for our investigation we take cubic basis starting from the documentclass pt minimal begin document pm bar end document pm lattice and investigate the potential energy landscape associated with the molecular orientation the crystal structures internal forces and external pressure were optimised at the level of dft with the exchange correlation functional of perdew burke and ernzerhof revised for solids pbesol the pb orbitals were treated as valence and scalar relativistic effects are included further calculations were made using non local hybrid exchange correlation functional hse calculations were performed using the vasp code ev plane wave cut off and reciprocal space sampling of point density internal structural parameters were converged to within mev and the phonon frequencies were checked at the zone centre to ensure that no imaginary modes were present the high frequency and static dielectric constants were computed using dfpt based upon tightly converged electronic wavefunction within ev and denser grid of points for pbi there is no strong orientation dependence of the ammonium ion owing to its approximately spherical topology local minimum structure is found where the four hydrogens are directed towards interstitial positions for ma pbi the behaviour is more subtle owing to molecular dipole of strength associated with the methylammonium ion e ch nh we identified three local minima where the dipole is aligned along of the and directions relative to the origin of the cubic lattice figure the total energy difference is within mev per atom with the orientation being most stable the absence of significant barrier to rotation mev is consistent with labile movement under standard conditions indeed and spectra have confirmed that ma cation rotation is rapid process at room temperature the predicted lattice constants for ma pbi vary from to table depending on the molecular orientation these compare well to the value of obtained from powder diffraction measurements and from computations distortions of the pbi octahedra are observed for both materials even within the cubic basis the presence of the molecule lowers the internal lattice symmetry of the parent perovskite structure and allows octahedral tilting to take place the inherent structural softness of pb ii is well documented arising from the stereochemical activity of the lone pair electrons the electronic band gap is determined by the states at the valence band maximum vbm and conduction band minimum cbm for both materials the vbm is formed of an anti bonding pb i combination while the cbm is formed of empty pb orbitals consistent with the formal electronic configuration of s from the topology of the band edge wave functions figure isotropic hole and electron band conduction is expected the strong dispersion of the bands in reciprocal space confirmed from k plots with documentclass pt minimal begin document n end document mn and documentclass pt minimal begin document p end document mp me is consistent with the reports of effective bipolar electrical conductivity dedicated study of the defect physics is required to fully assess the origin of intrinsic conductivity but partial occupancy of the organic cation sites is likely which would correspond to type doping the magnitude of the band gap determines the onset of optical absorption and is closely related to the maximum voltage achievable in photovoltaic device the gap increases from ev for pbi to ev for ma pbi table in all cases the band gap is strongly direct and determined at the boundary of the first brillouin zone documentclass pt minimal begin document frac pi frac frac frac end document a the increase is related to the significant expansion of the cell due to the larger cation there is no evidence of or ma contributing electronically to the frontier orbitals in agreement with our results previous investigation of sn based hybrids showed that while the organic cations maintain overall charge neutrality implying electronic mixing with the framework they do not contribute the upper valence or lower conduction band states responsible for conductivity indeed the bonds of and ma are found at least ev below the highest occupied state and ev above the lowest empty state respectively although the application of hybrid perovskites in solar cells has predominately focused on ma pbi our results suggest that pbi would also be effective for sensitisation towards longer wavelengths and an x ma xpbi alloy could be used to tune the absorption onset it should be noted that the same trends calculated with pbesol are observed using the hybrid hse functional however the predicted band gaps are larger optical absorption measurements place the band gap of ma pbi at ev while pbesol and hse predict values close to ev and ev respectively the calculated band gaps for materials formed by ns cations such as pb ii are reasonably described without non local electron exchange this originates here from cancellation of errors with the neglect of spin orbit splitting in the p valence and pb conduction bands due to the pseudo cubic lattice symmetry the dielectric response of the hybrid materials is anisotropic table the high frequency optical constants are close to those of other absorber materials g documentclass pt minimal begin document epsilon infty cdte end document cdte however the static dielectric response is much larger the large dielectric constants of pervoskite materials are associated with the structural flexibility that can support ferro anti and para electric ordering of dipoles associated with the organic and or inorganic sublattices pbi is predicted to have low frequency constants from to while ma pbi exhibits stronger screening of which can be understood through the additional response from the molecular dipole in ma pbi an isotropic average of the tensor across each orientation results in an effective dielectric constant of for ma pbi which is significantly larger than most tetrahedral semiconductors g documentclass pt minimal begin document epsilon cdte end document cdte and will affect electron transport in photovoltaic device with stronger screening of any macroscopic electric fields across the absorber layer an order disorder transition associated with the molecular dipole of ma in perovskite analogue has recently been reported to give rise to reversible switching in the dielectric response while no evidence has been reported of this effect in hybrid halide perovskites it is expected that they will also display some degree of amphidynamic behaviour arising from the collective motion of the constituent polar molecules tuning of the molecular dipoles represents potential route for further improving the performance of this class of materials in summary we have reported key properties of the hybrid perovskite layers used in thin film solar cells these materials combine low energy direct band gaps with static dielectric constants larger than due to the low barrier for rotation of the organic cations no long range ordering of the molecular dipoles associated with ch nh is expected however this could change in the presence of an external electric field transition from para to ferroelectric order would enhance electron hole separation if the electric field was light induced g in photovoltaic device this could give rise to novel photoferroic effect  the conventional microfluidic filter is modified with multi insulating blocks to achieve flow through manipulation and separation of microparticles the device transports particles by exploiting electro osmosis and electrophoresis and manipulates particles by utilizing dielectrophoresis dep polydimethylsiloxane pdms blocks fabricated in the main channel of the pdms filter induce nonuniform electric field which exerts negative dep force on the particles the use of multi insulating blocks not only enhances the dep force generated but it also increases the controllability of the motion of the particles facilitating their manipulation and separation experiments were conducted to demonstrate the controlled flow direction of particles by adjusting the applied voltages and the separation of particles by size under two different input conditions namely a dc electric field mode and ii combined ac and dc field mode numerical simulations elucidate the electrokinetic and hydrodynamic forces acting on particle with theoretically predicted particle trajectories in good agreement with those observed experimentally in addition the flow field was obtained experimentally with fluorescent tracer particles using the microparticle image velocimetry piv technique with the advancement of microfabrication technologies recent developments in biological and chemical analyses seek to integrate the complicated process of separation and sorting of particles and cells onto chip leading to the well known lab on chip loc technology numerous particle manipulation and separation techniques have been developed such as flow field fractionation fff optical tweezers fluorescence activated cell sorter facs electrophoresis ep and dielectrophoresis dep while optical tweezers and facs require sophisticated peripheral equipment and or modification on the surface of the samples for separation fff frequently encounters difficulties associated with the overlapping zone of particle samples due to band broadening in addition as separation using ep is promising only for charged particles and molecules such as proteins and dna in uniform electric field dep originally termed by pohl has been widely used for manipulating and separating biological cells such as live dead yeast cells bovine red blood cells bacteria and dna in nonuniform electric field the dep based techniques widely used in microscaled devices may be classified as the conventional dep cdep traveling wave dep twdep moving dielectrophoresis mdep and insulator based dep idep dep employs spatially nonuniform electric field to induce dipole in particle resulting in the unbalanced forces on each pole thus the net effect on the dipole gives rise to dielectrophoretic force as cdep utilizes metallic electrodes with ac voltages to manipulate the particles of different types toward either the high or low electric field region and uses pressure driven flow to elude the target particles the flow through separation of both types of particles is difficult to achieve although twdep offers continuous separation of particles it requires metallic electrodes and multichannel voltage power supply with phase adjusting functions mdep could separate particles for stationary fluid with single channel voltage supplied however the requirement of metallic electrodes remained in contrast by placing external electrodes into reservoirs idep is able to separate particles in simple channel with insulating posts using the idep concept lapizco encinas et al achieved separation of two species of living bacteria in water but their device could not provide flow through separation of these species as result the collection of the target particles is not efficient kang et al fabricated kernel block inside microchannel for separating polystyrene particles and red blood cells by size however the device requires multichannel dc voltage power supply the commercially available microfluidic filter offers continuous extraction and separation of analytes using mass diffusion as driving force and its platform also facilitates easy collection of analytes however the separation function of this device can suffer low efficiency and even fail especially for large sized particles such as cells whose mass diffusivity is very low and the difference of mass diffusivities between cells is not significant we report here modified polydimethylsiloxane pdms based filter platform with multi insulating blocks manipulation of flowing particles and size based continuous separation of particles are demonstrated using such modified filter device operated by only single channel dc power supply specifically we show that the use of multi insulating blocks can enhance the dielectrophoretic force effect on the particles which not only can improve the manipulation and separation of particles but also can confine the particles in small region so as to facilitate the necessary functions of the microfluidic device subsequently by employing single power supply that can simultaneously produce both ac and dc electric field we demonstrate that while the particles can be transported by the dc voltage the combined ac and dc electric field allows for the controlled manipulation of the particles this provides yet another parameter namely the ac voltage for controlled manipulation and separation of particles more importantly this leads to reduction of the threshold dc voltage for directing and separating particles in the filter device figure depicts the structure and dimensions in millimeters of the modified filter all channels have depth of the patterned pdms microfluidic channels were fabricated using the standard photo and soft lithography techniques and fig shows an image of the fabricated filter channels by scanning electron microscopy sem after four reservoirs were punctured for inlets and outlets the patterned pdms and glass slide were irreversibly bonded through an oxygen plasma treatment photograph of the entire device is shown in fig as reported in the literature the hydrophobicity and surface charges of the pdms channel walls changed with time in terms of hours the bonded channel was left overnight to obtain stable operation conditions such that the pdms walls exhibited hydrophobic tendency and decrease in the zeta potential as result during the operation of the device the particle ep is stronger than the fluid electro osmotic force eof latex polystyrene microspheres duke scientific usa of and in diameter were selected in our experiments as their sizes are comparable to biological cells such as yeast and red white cells the number concentration of particles in deionized di water purchased from the supplier was approximately ml prior to experiment the particle dispersion was diluted in m nahco buffer with volumetric ratio of this particle buffer mixture was introduced at inlet see fig while other reservoirs were filled with the buffer solution only after electrodes were placed in the four reservoirs but before the application of an electric field the buffer level in each reservoir was balanced using l precision syringe until no noticeable particle motion was observed under microscope the device was operated under various voltages produced by either one of the two different power sources in the dc electric field mode operation dc power supply stanford research usa and ii in the combined ac and dc field mode operation function generator

per second fps through charge coupled device ccd camera sensovation germany image resolution of pixels attached to microscope zeiss germany under objective lens since an image contains many particles only one representative particle was selected for analysis and its trajectory was constructed using image processing software imagepro plus in addition the microparticle image velocimetry piv technique was used to measure the velocity of the fluorescent tracer particles duke scientific the fluorescent particles have maximum excitation wavelength of nm and maximum emission wavelength of nm the original concentration particle ml in di water was diluted with nahco buffer solution in volumetric ratio of mercury lamp mbq ac zeiss connected to the fluorescence microscope zeiss with an appropriated filter set excitation of nm and emission greater than nm was used for fluorescence excitation to illuminate the fluorescent tracer particles two sequentially captured images were then evaluated with the pivview software pivtec gmbh to obtain the velocity field of the tracer particles in the modified pdms microfluidic filter the motion of charged particle in an electrolyte solution subjected to an externally applied electric field can be approximated to two dimensional model the following assumptions are made sedimentation due to particle gravity is negligible as the density of particle cm is close to that of the solution ii the zeta potential values of particles and channel walls are constant iii the electrical and thermophysical properties such as electrical permittivity and viscosity of the buffer are constant due to negligible joule heating effect in pdms glass channel filled by low concentration mm nahco iv the electric field distribution in the modified filter is two dimensional because both top and bottom wall are electrically insulating and the coupled particle channel interactions are not included therefore the equation of the particles trajectory can be described by newton second law in two dimensions mpd dt where the position of particles center is denoted by vector xpi ypj mp p is the particle mass and are the particle radius and density respectively and represents the net external forces exerting on the charged particle by applying voltage an electric field over the whole channel can be generated as schematically illustrated in fig near the insulating block corner the physical forces exerting on charged particle are attributed to electrophoresis ep electro osmosis eo hydrodynamics and dep as illustrated in fig it is further assumed that these forces on particle can be decoupled since the walls and particle are usually negatively charged the direction of the eof and ep forces on the particle is opposite figure shows the situation where ep is stronger than eof resulting in particle transport against eof toward the positive electrode electrophoretic under the assumptions of thin electric double layer edl of particles and no retardation effect the electrophoretic force acting on charged particle is given by ep m pe where is the electrical permittivity of the buffer in the absence of eof the negatively charged particle with zeta potential under an electric field is induced toward the positive electrode hydrodynamic and electro osmotic as charged particle travels in the microfluidic filter with velocity of dr dt it experiences hydrodynamic drag that retards its motion according to stokes law expressed as drag dr pdt eof with the assumption of thin edl of the channel walls the eof velocity can be estimated from smoluchowski equation eof w where is the dynamic viscosity of the buffer and is the zeta potential of the channel wall dielectrophoretic when particle is suspended in dielectric medium under an applied spatially nonuniform electric field both the particle and medium are polarized and dipole on the particle is induced each pole undergoes unequal electric forces resulting in net or dep force on the particle using the dipole moment method the time average dep force exerting on spherical particle is given by dep ma re e where denotes the time average and p p is known as the clausius mossotti cm factor is complex permittivity where is permittivity is an electrical conductivity and is the angular frequency re denotes the real part of the cm factor ranging from to when the particle is more polarized than the suspending medium re is positive and the positive dep will direct the particle toward the region of high electric field if the particle is less polarized than the medium re becomes negative and the negative dep force will repel the particle to the region of low electric field since the channel walls in the modified filter are insulating the total current is conserved in any cross sectional area of the channel when the area is considerably reduced at the blocks gap the electric field becomes high the maximum gradient of the electric field occurs at the blocks corners yielding the greatest dep force specifically under operation of the dc field mode where the cm factor reduces to p p for an electrically insulating particle whose conductivity is negligible compared to the buffer conductivity the cm factor becomes therefore the particle experiences negative dep force that repels the particle away from the blocks corners the dep force in eq becomes dep ma substituting the expressions of the ep hydrodynamic eof and dep forces into eq we obtain the equation governing the particle trajectory as au eof m pe ma adr pdt mpd pdt to solve eq the electric and eof velocity fields are required the typical thickness of an edl is in the range of to nm while the characteristic hydraulic diameter of microfluidic channels is of order to with such large difference the electrical potential distribution and the eof velocity profile within the edl region become insignificant thus the electrical potential distribution can be governed by laplace equation expressed as furthermore under such thin edl assumption the eof can be considered to be induced by moving wall with slip velocity and thus the eof velocity field is governed by the navier stokes equation and the continuity equation respectively expressed as t u u the boundary conditions for eqs and are summarized in table for laplace equation the electric field normal to the wall must be zero since all channel walls are insulating the symbol is the unit vector whose direction is perpendicular to the insulating walls to transport the negatively charged particle from inlet to either outlet or a voltage of vdc is applied at outlets and while inlets and are electrically grounded in the combined ac and dc field mode is the ac output voltage and vdc is the dc component as for the navier stokes equation all channel walls are set to have slip velocity according to the smoluchowski equation the unit vector is tangential to the insulating walls in the electrokinetic flow there is no external pressure applied at any reservoirs with the stated boundary conditions the electric and velocity fields were numerically solved using comsol multiphysicstm grid independent study was also performed in the simulations the zeta potential of hydrophobic pdms walls at room temperature was set to mv the zeta potential values of the and particles suspended in mm nahco buffer solution were chosen as and mv respectively the buffer solution density dynamic viscosity and electrical permittivity were kg kg s and v respectively experimental trajectories of the and particles under the effect of various applied dc voltages ranging from to are presented in figs and starting from arbitrary locations when passing block the particles were pushed away from the block where the electric field was high and thus the dep force was large and finally the particles were found to be confined area in small region of the gap between the block and the channel wall depending on the applied voltage the particles can be directed into either the upper or lower reservoir according to eq the ep and eof forces are linearly proportional to the electric field strength however the magnitude of the dep force depends on the gradient of the square of electric field an increase of applied voltage causes the particle to move faster and more importantly results in greater repulsive dep force that pushes the particle away from the block hence the particles trajectory can be shifted into the upper reservoir once the applied voltage researches threshold voltage vth as shown in figs and under the experimental conditions reported in this study the threshold voltages vth for the and particles were and respectively for voltages above vth the particles were transported towards the upper reservoir as suggested by eq the particle required lower threshold voltage since it acquired larger dep force compared to the particle under the same applied voltage figures and show reasonable agreement between experimental dotted lines and simulated solid lines results in the simulations the initial locations of the particles were selected to be the same as those determined from the experiments size dependent separation according to eq the dep force is proportional to the cubic power of particles radius particles of different sizes will thus experience significant difference in the dep force such mechanism was utilized in the modified filter to perform the separation of particles by size which may have potential in separating cells of different sizes for biomedical applications for demonstration purposes mixture of two sized particles g and was placed in the reservoir of the filter while an equal dc voltage was imposed to the two reservoirs and making use of the experimental findings presented in figs and v was applied such voltage reaches the threshold voltage of the particles but is still below the threshold voltage of the particles as shown in fig the particles were successfully separated from the particles another set of experiments was also conducted in the modified filter to separate the particles from the particles and the separation was achieved using the same voltage see fig these experimental observations are in good agreement with simulations as shown in figs and as demonstrated in the previous section rather high applied voltage is required so as to intensify the repulsive dep force for deflecting the particle trajectory high voltage however not only may produce joule heating effects but also can generate bubbles due to electrolysis furthermore in biomedical applications high voltage could also potentially jeopardize those cells sensitive to high voltage to reduce the applied voltage the utilization of combined dc and ac electric field is proposed moreover the ac component presents an added parameter for the control of the particle motion figures and show the experimental investigation of the and particles trajectories under combined dc and ac at khz voltages and the experimental and simulation results are compared in figs and the results indicated that the threshold voltage for the and particles was reduced for example the required threshold voltage for the particles was decreased from in the dc field mode to sin v in the combined dc and ac field mode and correspondingly the electric field strength at the blocks gap is lowered from to cm similarly for the particles the threshold voltage was reduced from to sin v experimental measurements and observations were supported by theoretical modeling lee et al reported that the electric field strength required for cell lysis was kv cm at frequency of mhz for both yeast cells and coli in microchannel however the electric field strength in our device was only cm through the application of sin v therefore the combined dc and ac electric field mode proposed in our technique will be useful and safe in applications of living cell separation scaling analysis suggests that the characteristic response time of charged particle to an applied electric field is of order ep a using in diameter and kg in density we can obtain particle electrophoretic response time of order ep s in the same fashion the characteristic response time of an eof to electric field can be estimated from eo dh for typical microchannel of in hydraulic diameter dh we can find the eof relaxation time of order eo s since khz was used in the experiment the particle ep should be able to follow the applied ac field component but not the liquid eof in other words the ac component of the eof is suppressed however as our ccd camera could only record images at rate of fps steady particle motion still was observed during the experiment but change in particle velocity due to ac electric field was noted the experimentally observed particle trajectories were in reasonably good agreement with the theoretical predictions however in the simulation the zeta potential values of the and particles suspended in mm nahco buffer solution were chosen as and mv respectively obviously such dependency of the particle zeta potential on size does not comply with the conventional electrokinetic theory hence the particle zeta potential can only be considered as fitting parameter in the model prediction it should be pointed out that several factors were not included in the model presented in this study and they include pressure head built up due to unequal solution levels at the reservoirs ii hydrodynamic and electrokinetic interactions between the particle and the channel wall iii heterogeneous electrokinetic effects such as discrete surface charges and nonuniform zeta potential and iv roughness and inclined edges of the channel walls therefore further improvement of the theoretical model is required in our future studies electro osmotic flow subjected to the boundary conditions table the numerically simulated eof velocity field induced by performed using comsol multiphysicstm is shown in fig since outlets and are assigned with higher voltage than inlets and two eof streams transport from outlets to inlets the eof velocity profiles at channels linked from outlets and exhibit plug like flow but are distorted at the junction the eof velocities satisfying the conservation of mass are increased when passing the blocks gaps in addition the velocity measurement of the fluorescent tracer particles subjected to was performed using the piv technique and the piv results are presented in fig a qualitative comparison between simulations and the experimental results indicates reasonable agreement in the eof flow pattern the piv measurement showed that the tracer particles moved along the same direction of the eof streams this implies that the tracer particles have lower electrical zeta potential compared to the channel walls as both the channel walls and the particles were negatively charged eof was opposite to ep therefore the magnitude of the velocity field obtained from the piv measurement was smaller than that from the simulation in addition the tracer particles dep was not considered in the simulation and it also contributed to the discrepancy however due to limitation of the frame speed of our ccd camera the piv measurement of the eof field was not performed for the combined dc and ac field mode  to shed light on the mechanism responsible for the weak ferromagnetism in undoped wide band gap oxides we carry out comparative study on zno thin films prepared using both sol gel and molecular beam epitaxy mbe methods compared with the mbe samples the sol gel derived samples show much stronger room temperature ferromagnetism with magnetic signal persisting up to and this ferromagnetic order coexists with high density of defects in the form of zinc vacancies the donor acceptor pairs associated with the zinc vacancies also cause characteristic orange red photoluminescence in the sol gel films furthermore the strong correlation between the ferromagnetism and the zinc vacancies is confirmed by our first principles density functional theory calculations and electronic band alteration as result of defect engineering is proposed to play the critical role in stabilizing the long range ferromagnetism the prospect of incorporating magnetic properties into wide band gap oxides has attracted much attention as promising route to develop diluted magnetic oxides dmo there have been intensive research efforts focused on wide band gap oxides among which doped zno is considered as prominent candidate and has attracted tremendous research interest over the past decade this intense interest on zno is also fueled by the fact that zno promises many applications in optoelectronic and transparent electronics as it boasts wide band gap ev and large exciton binding energy mev at room temperature the initial attention was drawn on zno by the theoretical prediction that type zno doped with mn would show room temperature ferromagnetism rtfm this report has been followed by numerous experiments on rtfm in zno doped with wide range transition metals such as mn co fe cr and cu however progress has been hampered by large disparities in experimental results and interpretations and controversies also originate from the fact that the observed ferromagnetism is usually so weak that it is hard to distinguish it from the extrinsic sources or artefacts it has been well recognized that the major obstacle in studying the magnetism in dilute doped oxides is related to extrinsic tendency of metal clustering as illustrated in fig although the transition metal ions with open shells are intended to dope homogeneously into the oxide host the strong cohesive force between the neighboring impurities leads to their aggregation instead of the desired random distribution this is particularly true if the samples are grown in reducing environment or annealed in vacuum these nanoscale metal clusters may contribute to the overall magnetism but the cluster oxide composites do not qualify as genuine diluted magnetic semiconductors recently there has been accumulating evidences suggesting that defects play important roles in establishing the magnetic order in wide band gap oxides in particular rtfm has been reported in undoped zno which to certain degree helps to settle the controversies delineated above due to the absence of any intentionally doped metallic element this emergent ferromagnetism in undoped oxides is often called ferromagnetism where defects are believed to be responsible in initiating hybridization at the fermi level and establishing long range ferromagnetism it may not be very surprising as the defects have been recognized for long time to play important roles in dictating the electrical and optical properties of most wide band gap oxide semiconductors as we illustrated in fig this approach forms strong contrast with doping transition metals by avoiding the occurrence of unintentional clustering indeed experimental observations of ferromagnetism in zno thin films and pure zno powders have been attributed to the intrinsic defects it was also proposed that defects like zn and vacancies zn interstitial grain boundaries and lattice distortion can induce ferromagnetism rtfm has been observed in wide range of undoped oxides such as tio hfo in sno ceo cu and mgo suggesting that the underlying physics is universal however open questions still remain related to this approach of defect engineering towards magnetism in oxides g what kinds of defects can contribute magnetic moments how to establish the long range magnetic coupling of local moments in an oxide host thus it is of paramount importance to investigate the roles of intrinsic defects in the onset of ferromagnetism because of their abundance in wide band gap oxides on the other hand we should note that although there is no immediate danger of metal clustering in undoped oxides extreme cares should still be taken to exclude the contribution of magnetic contaminations which clearly entails deliberate experimental designs furthermore although native defects have been recognized as important players influencing the electrical and optical properties of zno it is formidable task to quantitatively determine their concentrations as well as their exact contributions to the physical properties one approach is to adjust the growth environment with the hope that the tuned chemical potentials of zn and may lead to the preferred formation of different defects this can also be accomplished via post synthesis treatments such as annealing in different gas atmospheres another complimentary approach is to compare the experimental results with the first principles calculations which often can provide useful insights regarding to the defect formation energies their positions in the band gap and even the possible magnetic orders in this work we carried out systematic study on the effect of defects in particular zinc vacancy vzn on the ferromagnetism in undoped zno by comparing the results of two distinct growth methods e sol gel sg and mbe by carefully selecting the precursor and deliberately maintaining an oxygen rich growth environment we can reproducibly create high density of vzn defects in the sg films while suppressing the formation of other types of defects these high density vzn are accompanied by characteristic defect related light emission in the photoluminescence spectra importantly clear signal of rtfm was observed in the zn deficient sg samples which is absent in the near stoichiometric mbe zno thin films these complimentary optical and magnetic data suggest clear correlation between the ferromagnetism and the zinc vacancies moreover ab initio calculations were carried out to confirm that vzn in wurtzite zno can indeed induce magnetic moments at the fermi level and the spin dependent band alteration as result of this defect engineering is the origin of the observed ferromagnetism in undoped zno to implement comparative study we used two distinct routes to synthesize undoped zno thin films it is well known that the structure and property of thin films strongly depend on the synthesis routes and the synthesis can be tuned effectively to engineer the type and density of defects in particular oxide thin films grown by chemical solution based methods like the sol gel growth are often characterized by an oxygen rich composition and contain large amount of point defects like vzn as the first type of samples sol gel zno thin films were coated on si substrates followed by annealing in typical experiment commercialized si substrates were first cleaned ultrasonically in ethanol and then treated by plasma to render hydrophilic surface zn ch coo o was dissolved in mixture of solvent methoxyethanol and stabilizer aminoethanol after thoroughly stirring the solution at rt for a homogeneous and transparent solution was obtained the precursor films were formed by spin coating the starting solution on the substrates at rpm for after the spin coating the precursor films were heated at oc for min in order to remove the volatile species and then crystallized at oc in oxygen ambient for this process was repeated several times to achieve desired film thickness of nm the second type of zno films samples is high quality nm thick epilayers grown on plane sapphire substrates using v mbe system equipped with knudsen cells of zn solid source purity and rf plasma oxygen source in order to obtain clean surfaces the substrates were chemically etched in hot solution of so po at oc for min the mbe growth took place at substrate temperature of oc two dimensional growth mode was sustained throughout the growth process as evidenced by the streaky reflection high energy electron diffraction rheed patterns in terms of structure and stoichiometry the mbe samples show different characteristics from the sg ones which allows us to carry out comparative study and determine the role of defects in the onset of ferromagnetism we performed comprehensive and systematic analysis on the structural and physical properties of the samples the crystalline structure of the samples was characterized by ray diffraction xrd with cu radiation nm atomic force microscopy afm images were taken on scanning probe microscope veeco digital instruments with si probe tips quantitative compositional analysis was carried out using an ray energy dispersive spectrometer eds and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims iv instrument from iontof gmbh was employed to yield elemental depth profiles photoluminescence pl measurements in the temperature range of were carried out under the excitation of he cd laser with wavelength of nm and power of mw magnetization measurements were carried out in superconducting quantum interference device squid magnetometer quantum design mpmsxl transport measurements were performed on the samples with the van der pauw configuration in physical properties measurement system ppms throughout the synthesis and measurements only plastic tweezers were used to avoid any contamination from metal tools physical properties of undoped zno films the xrd patterns shown in figs and suggest that both mbe and sg samples grown on si and sapphire substrates are single phase wurtzite zno with orientation indeed highly textured zno thin films have been previously achieved via soft chemistry routes by fine tuning the hydrolysis condensation of zn ethanolamine complexes insets of figs and illustrate the corresponding afm images of mbe and sg samples whose root mean square rms roughness are and nm respectively figure depicts the eds spectrum of as grown sg zno film and after systematic calibration the detected zn atomic ratio is which indicates the existence of zn deficiency this zn deficiency can be reduced by annealing in an ar gas flowing environment in particular run the zn atomic ratio increases to after the as grown sg sample was annealed at oc for min in comparison the mbe film shows much higher zn ratio of suggesting certain degree of oxygen deficiency these various compositions are illustrated in the inset of fig we should note here that extensive eds scans in all samples showed no other impurity above the detection limit we also carried out multiple experiments to calibrate the sample compositions during period of three months after synthesis and found that the chemical compositions of these thin films are quite stable considering that sims is powerful technique with high detection resolutions to probe the element distribution we performed tof sims measurements on our samples using kev ar as primary ions figure gives the sims depth profiles of zn and elements in the sg and the mbe zno films suggesting uniform distribution in both types of samples furthremore the impurity signals including magnetic elements such as cr mn fe ni and co are within the measurement noise although the yields in defferent samples vary the calibrated zn ratio of the as grown sg film is obviously smaller than that of the mbe sample which is in agreement with the eds results in the following we will discuss how these composition variations affect the magnetic properties of the samples and then link it with the characteristics of defects we carried out the magnetic measurements on these sg and mbe thin film samples using squid magnetometer with the magnetic field applied parallel to the film plane figure shows the raw data of magnetization versus applied magnetic field h without subtracting the substrate contribution measured at and in order to exclude the effect of any potential contamination of the substrates that may contribute to the observed magnetism we measured the bare silicon and sapphire substrates following the same procedures and determined their diamagnetic contributions the squid data after subtracting the substrate diamagnetic contributions are shown in fig the immediate observation is that the ferromagnetic signal from the sg sample is much stronger than that of the mbe sample for the as grown sg sample the coercive field and the saturation magnetization ms at are oe and u i b unit cell respectively several measurements spanning more than two months confirm the reproducibility of data figs and the ms of the sg sample is about four times stronger than the value previously reported in laser ablated undoped zno thin films with the comparable thickness in contrast the mbe sample shows much weaker magnetic signal with its ms about fifty times smaller than that of the sg sample since both samples were handled in the same way we can conclude that the much enhanced magnetism in the sg sample cannot come from any post synthesis contamination further proof came from control experiment where we broke the sg sample into few pieces and then measured their individual magnetic signals if the magnetism originates from contaminations like contacting with metal tweezers then the distribution should be inhomogeneous as shown in fig the magnetism in unit of emu c remain the same after the breakage of sample which indicates negligible contamination these compositional and magnetic data delineated above suggest clear correlation between the ferromagnetism and the zn deficiency the magnetism in the sg sample with higher zn deficiency is much stronger than that in the mbe sample if this scenario is correct then the ar annealed sg sample with less zn deficiency should exhibit weaker magnetism indeed as shown in fig ms of the annealed sg sample decreases to almost one eighth of the original value this gives further supports to our hypothesis that zn deficiency boosts ferromagnetism in undoped zno thin films we should also note here that the weak magnetism of the mbe sample may come from some unintentional incorporation of impurities which is very difficult or even impossible to exclude during synthesis the temperature dependent magnetization in the samples was further measured under an applied magnetic field of oe in both the zero field cooled zfc and the field cooled fc modes the data shown in fig suggest again that the magnetization of the sg sample is much stronger than that of the mbe sample in the whole temperature range using an oven attached to the squid magnetometer we measured the magnetization of the sg sample up to under the field cooled mode as depicted in the normalized t k data in fig the magnetization starts to decrease as increases above and after another sharp drop at the magnetization vanishes almost completely at about which could be taken as the transition temperature tc such high temperature magnetic measurements have been seldom reported for wide band gap oxides to the best of our knowledge the data reported here are the first for undoped zno clearly the mechanism underlying this high temperature ferromagnetism and the temperature dependent behaviors warrant further investigations electrical and magnetotransport the temperature dependent resistivity data in fig suggest semiconducting behavior for both the sg and the mbe zno thin films the higher resistivity in the sg sample suggests lower density of state at the fermi level and or stronger localization we examined various conduction mechanisms and found that our transport data in the low temperature regime reconcile with the three dimensional mott variable range hopping vrh mechanism as shown in the inset of fig which plots ln vs such transport characteristics of undoped zno is consistent with the previous reports at higher temperatures the thermally activated band conduction appears to be the dominant mechanism magnetotransport measurements such as magnetoresistance mr and anomalous hall effect ahe have been rarely reported for undoped zno figure shows the mr data taken on the sg and the mbe zno films negative mr was observed in both samples and it reaches sg and mbe at under koe these data can be explained by taking into account the third order expansion of the d exchange hamiltonian which gives semiempirical expression documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation delta rho rho ln h end equation end document ln h where a f s b pi frac rho g frac mu alpha kt s fg kt here is the exchange integral is the density of states at the fermi level is the average magnetization is the spin of the localized magnetic moments and is numerical constant fitting parameters obtained from the mr data are sg sg asg bsg mbe mbe ambe bmbe if we assume that other parameters for sg and mbe zno samples are similar and consider that is low in the sg sample the larger fitting parameter sg bsg in the sg sample indicates stronger exchange coupling between the mobile carriers and localized magnetic moments also smaller mbe ambe is qualitatively consistent with the much smaller magnetization observed in the mbe sample ahe is often conceived as proof of intrinsic ferromagnetism although it could also originate from metal clusters to form metal clusters the magnetic impurity concentration must be high enough to either reach the bulk percolation threshold or lead to the formation of large clusters with size of nm near the interface apparently those scenarios are highly unlikely in our undoped samples since they were synthesized by using high purity precursor materials with negligible metal contamination the anomalous part of xy should be proportional to the magnetization in the regime of low magnetic field whereas the ordinary hall effect dominates in the high field regime after subtraction of the ordinary hall effect the linear high field component clear ahe was observed in the sg zno film as shown in fig this is consistent with the larger exchange coupling in the sg zno obtained from the mr results the small magnitude of the ahe signal in our sample is typical for magnetic oxides which can be attributed to the high resistivity and the low concentration of mobile carriers in comparison xy of the nonmagnetic mbe sample shows only the ordinary hall effect which is consistent with its very weak magnetism in zno without any intentional doping intrinsic or native defects play important roles in determining the physical properties however the characteristics of various defects like their concentrations and locations in the band gap remain as controversial issues recently most of the experimental and theoretical studies have reached consensus that oxygen vacancies and zinc vacancies are the defects with the lowest formation energies here we used pl measurements to investigate the defect related emissions in sg and mbe zno samples aiming to reveal the nature of the defects in fig the temperature dependent pl spectra of the sg sample are characterized by near band edge nbe uv peak along with broad orange red emission band the weak green emission at the shoulder of the orange red band is usually attributed to oxygen vacancies vo and the associated donors bound excitons also give rise to the characteristic emission in the nbe region the orange red luminescence in zno containing no foreign impurities can be considered to be intrinsic and attributed to zn deficiency as in previous reports we ascribe this zn deficiency to vzn defects which will be confirmed later by the temperature dependent pl studies and the first principles calculations the origin of the orange red luminescence is likely related to the intraband transitions involving vo and vzn defect complexes e donor acceptor pair dap emission furthermore this orange red emission band shows fine structured peaks equally separated by the longitudinal optical phonon energy of mev which has been rarely reported in literature for undoped zno and might be attributed to the strong electron phonon coupling associated with the deep vo levels as shown in fig in the mbe sample on the other hand the orange red emission is negligible instead weak green emission was observed which suggest different types of radiative defects the abundance of the vzn defects in the as grown sg thin films is related to the particular oxygen rich growth environment where the reconstruction of the cation and anion ions occurs this solution based growth route is very different from the often employed physical vapor deposition methods like mbe sputtering and pulsed laser deposition leading to the formation of distinct defect species in the sg synthesis incomplete pyrolysis and oxygen saturated chemical bond often produce oxygen rich zinc poor films indeed the synthesis composition correspondence is quite robust about twenty zno thin films prepared in the sg route consistently exhibit clear zn deficiency and their pl spectra always show the characteristic orange red emission as shown in fig fine structures were clearly resolved in the nbe emission spectra measured at and the peaks can be identified as the free excitons fe bound excitons and their corresponding replicas in details the peaks at and ev can be assigned to the emission of donor bound excitons x and acceptor bound excitons x respectively longitudinal optical photon replicas of the acceptor bound excitons x lo and the free excitons fe lo can also be identified lying mev away from the main peaks as expected the x nbe emission in the sg sample is much stronger than that in the mbe sample due to the presence of vzn as acceptors figure shows the temperature dependent pl spectra of the sg zno sample in the uv region illustrating the evolution of the dominant bound exciton emissions measured from to figure depicts the arrhenius plot of the x integrated intensity as function of the solid line is the least square fit of the data according to the relationship left right ae left b b right it ae eb kbt where the activation energy eb was calculated to be mev according to the haynes rule eb should correspond to of the energy difference between the acceptor vzn level and the valence band maximum vbm therefore as depicted in the inset of fig it is expected that the radiative transition e the vzn related dap emission from the vo level ev from the vbm to the vzn level ev from the vbm should give an emission at ev indeed this is consistent with our observation of the orange red emission which is also in line with the reported values of ev in zn deficient zno samples since the sg zno thin film sample has both vo and vzn as the main defect species then critical question arises which defect contributes to the observed ferromagnetism as we will show later vzn has much lower formation energy than vo in the oxygen rich growth environment typical for the sol gel synthesis which implies dominantly high density of vzn in the sg sample on the other hand the near stoichiometric mbe film containing vo shows much weaker magnetism furthermore there are two additional reasons leading us to believe that vzn plays the critical role in establishing the ferromagnetic order one is that the magnetism was weakened after ar annealing which is believed to heal the vzn defects in the as grown samples the other evidence comes from the recent reports where cation vacancies was suggested to be responsible in establishing the ferromagnetism in wide band gap oxides additionally many recent theoretical calculations suggest that the electrons contributed by vo cannot establish ferromagnetism these considerations guided us to focus on the role of vzn in the first principles calculations which will be detailed in the next section first principle calculations to support the correlation between ferromagnetism and zn to shed light on the defect induced magnetism in undoped zno we performed the first principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory as implemented in the vasp code the projector augmented wave paw potentials were used for electron ion interactions while exchange correlation effects were treated within the perdew burke ernzerhoff form of the generalized gradient approximation gga spin polarized self consistent calculations were performed using plane wave basis set limited by cutoff energy of ev defect calculations were performed using supercells and monkhorst pack point mesh which ensure an energy convergence of ev cell atomic relaxations were performed until the hellmann feynman forces on atoms are less than ev the optical properties of zno are obtained using hybrid density functional and crystal code which gives the correct zno band gap the internal configurations of the atoms were relaxed before any addition of defects to ensure that the bulk zno is in equilibrium state magnetic moments and ferromagnetic order in zno with using supercell containing atoms zn wurtzite structure we considered several possible native point defects relevant to our experiments namely zinc interstitial zni vzn vo oxygen interstitial oi and zni vo complex the formation energy of an intrinsic defect in zno is calculated from documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation f tot e tot rm pm sum i mu end equation end document ef etotd etot ni where tot etotd is the total energy of the supercell containing the intrinsic defect tot etot is the total energy of the host supercell without the defects ni is the number of atoms removed from the host supercell to create vacancy or added to the host supercell to create an interstitial and is the chemical potential of the corresponding atom for simplicity we have kept the valence of the defects constant in the calculations the calculated defect formation energies as functions of the oxygen chemical potential are depicted in fig in the oxygen rich environment like in the sol gel synthesis vzn and oi possess the lowest formation energies of and ev respectively this also implies that these two defects have the highest densities in the sg sample because the concentration of native defect in solid is determined by its formation energyef through the relation documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation n exp left frac f b right end equation end document nexp efkbt where is the number of possible sites the defects may occupy kb is the boltzmann constant and is the temperature thus we focus on vzn and oi in the following discussions in fig one vzn was modeled by taking out neutral zn atom colored with light grey in the zn supercell which corresponds to defect concentration of as the nominal valence of zn in zno is two holes are generated to compensate zn vacancy the atomic structures of all the systems were relaxed before the properties of the crystals are examined and it was found that vzn shows magnetic moment of electronic structure calculations were performed on these systems to determine their spin polarizations in the crystal we calculated the density of states dos of zno with vzn and oi using hybrid functional with the correct energy gap of zno the defect level of vzn is about ev above the vbm fig which is in agreement with the vzn level in the gap as determined from our experimental pl spectra even though oxygen interstitial also shows finite magnetic moment it is ruled out as the origin of the observed ferromagnetism since there is no experimental spectral evidence for transition involving defect levels of interstitial fig the fm state is expected to be stable at room temperature since its energy is mev lower than that of the afm state which is in agreement with the experimentally observed rtfm the calculated spin density for two vzn in the supercell is shown in fig the strong p interaction between the unpaired electrons at sites surrounding the vzn appears to be the source for the observed ferromagnetism in the sg zno sample indeed although oxygen vacancies were originally proposed as the source of magnetism in undoped oxides like hfo density functional calculations later found no evidence for magnetic moments around oxygen vacancies instead partially depleted oxygen orbitals around cation vacancies were found effective to give rise to large magnetic moments regarding to the distribution of vzn in undoped zno both theoretical and experimental studies suggest that vzn localized on the surfaces contribute more to the extended magnetism which warrants further studies in summary we have carried out comparative study of the magnetic and optical properties of undoped sol gel and mbe zno thin films aiming to revealing the roles of various defects in stabilizing the ferromagnetic order clear signal of rtfm was observed in the as grown zn deficient sol gel zno thin films which became much weaker after annealing on the other hand the mbe film showed negligible magnetism the sol gel film also exhibited large negative mr and clear ahe the systematic photoluminescence measurements and first principles calculations revealed the close link between the observed rtfm in the sol gel film and the high density of defects in the form of vzn besides confirming the position of the vzn level in the band gap our calculations also indicated that the magnetic moments arise from the unpaired electrons at the sites surrounding the vzn defects overall our results suggest that defect engineering via producing fm correlated spin polarized defects is viable route to realizing the potentials of zno based materials in spintronic devices for future applications  mixing lead zirconate titanate with lead iron tantalate produces single phase low loss room temperature

through tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition during cooling ray scattering analysis revealed two possible orthorhombic symmetries at room temperature giving d or pmm v and two possible tetragonal phases at elevated temperatures m h or mm v however square polarization hysteresis in both phases plus second order dielectric divergence to epsilon at for pft to at for pft require an unambiguous assignment as c c pmm mm transition in addition we find evidence from raman scattering that this system becomes cubic pm bar above ca but below its melting point and from dielectric loss

out with diffracplus topas software supplied by bruker the micro raman measurements were performed in the backscattering geometry using the jobin yvon spectrometer the excitation radiation of nm from coherent ar laser was focused onto the sample surface the scattering light was dispersed by samples and collected with charge coupled device ccd detector the flat polished surfaces of the sintered

room temperature magnetic measurements were performed using vibrating sample magnetometer vsm lakeshore model temperature xrd studies confirm the existence of structural phase transition in pztft and systems from orthorhombic to tetragonal structure with lowering in temperature the xrd data show no second phase at the level over all the temperature regions the temperature evolutions of the and pseudo cubic bragg reflections of pztft ceramic are shown in figure and respectively at low temperature k and k the peaks are wide and the characteristic orthorhombic splitting and of the peaks is seen in figure with further temperature increase the triplet peak gradually transforms to doublet peak the reflections and become more resolved and better separated which shows the evolution of phases from orthorhombic low temperature to tetragonal high temperature t in order to resolve the ceramic patterns reported in figure we fitted into separate bragg components without any suggestion of concrete structural model applying the pattern decomposition method and applying the whole powder pattern decomposition wppd method proposed by pawley this method can refine the unit cell parameters and decompose the whole powder pattern into individual reflections implying crystal system and calculating the cell parameters the concrete computer program applied to carry out the calculations was the bruker diffracplus topas software this is graphics based nonlinear least squares profile analysis that integrates between other features via the wppd pawley method the crystal structure refinements were performed for diffraction patterns recorded from temperature from to the best agreement between the experimental data and theoretical models were achieved in case of and pmm space groups for orthorhombic and m and mm for tetragonal the difference between calculated parameters in each case is within the error of the refinements xrd analysis could not distinguish between two orthorhombic phases at room temperature d or pmm v nor between two tetragonal phases at elevated temperatures m h or mm v however from crystallography is known that orthorhombic sphenoidal p and orthorhombic pyramidal v pmm are enantiomorphic and polar types respectively on the other hand tetragonal dipyramidal h m and ditetragonal pyramidal v mm are centrosymetric and polar respectively hence one way to assignment the right space group of each phase of the pztft ceramics is exploring the possibility of ferroelectricity of the sample in each phase and verifying that the transition is second order thermodynamically so that group subgroup relation exists between the upper and lower symmetries below we describe in detail these possibilities raman spectroscopy is versatile technique to investigate the crystal structure of the materials at global bulk crystal symmetry and local nano scale crystal symmetry level raman scattering is sensitive to variations in inter atomic potentials and local site coordination at atomic level for this reason raman scattering has been extensively used to investigate the structure and structural instability through the observation of frequency shifts linewidths or intensities of raman active phonons temperature dependent raman spectra of pztft for and respectively are shown in figure and respectively varying from room temperature until the raman spectrum of ceramic pzt contains series of broad overlapping bands which is typical of samples with tetragonal phase in this composition range according to the factor group analysis tetragonal pzt has optical normal modes a b of which a and are both raman and ir actives and one pair of e correspond to the three acoustic branches raman spectra of pzt show the low frequency phonon modes to and lo at cm and cm four additional peaks at cm cm cm and cm which are assigned to to e and to and lo modes respectively however the lowest frequency modes are not seen clearly in pztft spectra when because of strong rayleigh scattering intensity the modes to and e correspond to bo rotation while to and lo are related to b bending and o stretching of oxygen octahedral respectively these modes shifted towards lower frequencies with increase in pft content the decrease in wave number with increasing pft content is due to the large difference in the atomic mass of zr amu and ti amu when they are replaced by fe amu and ta amu at the site the high frequency phonon mode at cm appears for pft resembling the g phonon mode of pft at cm which is attributed to the vibration of oxygen ion in the oxygen octahedra of ordered nanodomains having local space group fm the weak bands observed below cm were assigned to the disorder induced modes in the disordered matrix having the space group of pm it is clear from figure and that the raman spectra change in the vicinity of phase transition from orthorhombic pmm to tetragonal mm t for pztft and at and respectively support the xrd observation close look of temperature dependent raman data revealed the almost disappearance of to cm polarization modes the most prominent effects was observed in to cm frequency range these modes almost disappeared above the ferroelectric phase transition temperature marked in the figure it is interesting to note that these optic modes are more responsible for polarization in the system which diminished after the ferroelectric phase transition as evidenced by raman spectra figure present the proposed deconvoluted raman spectra of the pztft at different temperature representing the evolution of symmetry with temperature orthorhombic tetragonal and cubic the raman spectra recorded within orthorhombic and tetragonal symmetries can be well deconvolution into and lines respectively the quantities analysis of raman spectra near the three phase transition regions with different crystal structure were carried out with the help of the damped harmonic oscillator model dho raman

phonon mode as dho all the raman active modes were fitted with the unconstrained variables parameters at representative temperature raman spectra at the lowest frequencies were fitted with gaussian and lorentzian both centered in zero frequency shift that allow better deconvolution of the spectra the group theory analysis allows the presence of and active raman modes in the case of orthorhombic and tetragonal respectively see table the unambiguous assignments of raman active modes for polycrystalline ceramic composite materials were not scientifically viable at least for the orthorhombic phase figure the broad raman lines were observed for these materials that complicate the fit analysis processes which could lead more uncertainties in assignments to avoid any possible mistake only peak positions for orthorhombic phase were assigned for accurate assignments polarized raman analysis of pztft single crystal or epitaxial films is desirable in case of the tetragonal phase we used the assignment of raman modes already reported for pb zrxti o with since in this composition the pzt belongs to the mm v point group as is shown in figure the fitting raman modes are in good agreement with those reported the changes from orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition are manifested mainly by the reduction of number of lines from to as expected none of the prominent peaks were observed at during the second phase transition from tetragonal to cubic the temperature dependences of the lattice parameters of pztft and are presented in figure and upper for the data presented we chose pmm and mm as space groups in orthorhombic and tetragonal phase respectively as discussed above the criteria we use to determine the space group were if the space group is polar if the space group of orthorhombic phase is subgroup of that of the tetragonal phase from figure temperature variations of polarization vs electric field show that both phases are ferroelectric detailed temperature variation of the ferroelectric properties will be presented below for the tetragonal phase high temperature we select the mm polar point group since m is centrosymetric for orthorhombic low temperature pmm point group is polar is emantiomorphic in which there is the possibility of polar or nonpolar structures however pmm is subgroup of mm study of dielectric phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal was also observed from temperature variation of the dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss at different frequencies and temperature dependent lattice parameters measurement in the range from to the observation of dielectric maxima peak had shown in figure and lower evidence ferroelectric ferroelectric phase transition of pztft with rise of temperature as in normal ferroelectrics the dielectric permittivity of pztft compounds increases gradually with increasing temperature up to the transition curie temperature tc and thereafter it decreases phase

theory for second order ferroelectric phase transitions the tc for and were determined to be and respectively indicating downward shift with the increase of pft percent shoulder in loss tangent near the dielectric permittivity maxima peak with further slow increase in loss at elevated temperature was also observed it is worth mentioning that the orthorhombic lattice parameters overlap near the phase transition and it was hard to fit with either of the tetragonal orthorhombic symmetries above observation also suggests the transition period of crystals in which system was in non equilibrium state while with further increase in temperature it fitted well with the tetragonal symmetry polarization figure shows the room temperature polarization electric field e hysteresis loop of pztft ceramic with and well saturated e loops were observed in both pztft systems the remanent polarization was enhanced from cm to cm with increase of pzt percentage in pztft composites however no significance change was observed in coercive field ec kv cm the temperature evolution of the polarization favors an orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition in both the systems figure shows anomalous enhancement of polarization with perfect square loops above the ferroelectric phase transition of pztft k the enhancement in polarization value near the phase transition confirms the t phase transition and rules out higher symmetry cubic phase with zero polarization high and low temperature raman studies revealed two more structural phase transition one at higher temperature for tetragonal cubic c and other from orthorhombic rhombohedral r near the details of these low and high temperature phase transitions will be presented in separate paper magnetization pure pztft and ceramics with no impurity phase within the detection limit of xrd showed well behaved magnetization vs applied field hysteresis at room temperature as shown in figure these systems showed the good remanent magnetization and emu for and respectively at room temperature which is comparable to the known room temperature multiferroics including bismuth ferrite and other lead based multiferroic relaxors the room temperature magnetization value of bohr magnetons per fe spin using known density of cc and cell volume of cm is quite reasonable this magnetization is equivalent to about of the saturation value of the fe ions are known to cluster in pure pbfe nb and pbfe ta which is responsible for the relatively high magnetic ordering temperature for only fe occupation of the site in our specimens the magnetization t shows only one divergence near with no sign of second phase or phase transition it is worth mentioning that with increase in pft contents this system does not show any increased magnetic ordering possess low magnetization compare to we have done careful detailed magnetic study of the system and repeated the measurements with samples synthesized at different times with the same results only certain threshold percentages of pft activate the magnetic ordering for further insight in the magnetic behavior of these samples field cooled fc and zero field cooled zfc studies were carried out over wide range of temperature figure shows the zfc and fc data of pztft these show nonlinear non zero magnetization up to room temperature magnetic irreversibility mirr mfc mzfc especially for low zfc persists for wide temperature regions to th or th order of the magnitude sharp increase in magnetization was observed below neels temperature tn related to the original pft was not observed in zfc and fc magnetization curve suggests the existence of super antiferromagnetic and or super paramagnetic clusters far above the ambient temperature actually both super paramagnetic cluster model and super antiferromagnetic cluster model are used to explain the possible presence of weak magnetism in the lead based multiferroics blinc et al has carried out the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiment on pfn ceramic and explains the presence of weak magnetization above neel temperature in context of super paramagnetic cluster model the explanation of observed weak magnetization in vs curve or zfc fc data in pfn pft or pfw same class materials was first given by prof smolenskii they explained on the basis of super exchange interaction at site octahedral and also spin canting the existence of magnetization above the neel temperature in sol gel prepared pfn ceramic had explained on the basis of spins canting and super paramagnetic ions cluster peng et al in pfn pb mn o system explains the existence of magnetization on superantiferromagnetic saf model still the observations of weak magnetization in the lead based frustrated system are very poorly understood we have not observed any noticeable anomaly near the tn of pft for investigated solid solution although martinez et al observed very weak anomaly near neel temperature for polycrystalline pft ceramics electric control of magnetization me coupling was measured on conducting la sr mno lsmo coated pztft ceramic at room temperature moderate electric control of remanent

performed on poled ceramics samples the observed changes in magnetization under electric field follow linear relation suggest pm polarization magnetization type of coupling as expected and observed in bfo and other related multiferroics the present me values comparable than the value obtained for single phase cr s and also for other single phase materials we have successfully prepared single phase pztft ceramics by conventional solid state route temperature dependent xrd revealed structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic under cooling pztft shows classic textbook example of several sequential phase transitions cubic tetragonal ca to tetragonal orthorhombic for and for and to orthorhombic rhombohedral a sequence similar to that in barium titanate it showed both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature with very low leakage even at perfect square hysteresis at zfc and fc data display nonlinear magnetic susceptibility with irreversibility up to room temperature me coupling is of the same order of magnitude as in the single phase multiferroic pft  this work addresses the effect of energy level alignment between the hole transporting

the open circuit voltage can be maximized leading to power conversion efficiencies of up to these values are obtained with hole transport materials that differ from the commonly used spiro meo tad and correspond to performance increase versus this reference in the last five years new class of inorganic organic photovoltaic pv devices based on methylammonium lead halide perovskite absorbers ch nh pbx br cl have attracted considerable attention mainly due to three significant advantages inexpensive precursors variety of available fabrication methods and consistently high power conversion efficiency values many studies have highlighted the exceptional characteristics of these perovskite materials which not only exhibit panchromatic absorption but also display charge carrier mobility values comparable to amorphous silicon and balanced electron hole diffusion lengths exceeding these findings prompted the use of organolead trihalide perovskites as standalone absorber transport material in planar heterojunction device architectures moving towards standard stacks used in organic pvs with very promising results minimizing energy losses while favoring high charge extraction rates is fundamental to take greater advantage of the intrinsic properties of the perovskites and achieve efficiencies beyond the current status notably and by analogy from organic pv device theory while the maximum open circuit photovoltage voc can be approximated by the perovskite energy gap it can be limited by the relative energy difference between the ionization potential electron affinity ip ea of the hole electron transporting material htm etm in other words to maximize the voc while still maintaining favorable charge extraction the ip ea values of the chosen htm etm must approach but not exceed deceed those of the perovskite layer respectively this issue has been raised by schulz et al when they identified that energy losses of up to ev could arise from an ip mismatch between the commonly used spiro meo tad htm ip ev figure and ch nh pbix clx ip ev in solution processed cells the alignment between the energy levels of the htm and the perovskites remains to be addressed despite the exploration of many alternatives pedot pss ht poly triphenylamine derivatives poly diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives and spiro meo tad derivatives among recent studies which have heavily focused on the optimization of solution processed cells with and without mesoporous metal oxide layers two reports have identified thin film vapor deposition as successful method to fabricate uniform flat perovskite films and yield high efficiency devices when used in conjunction with solution processed transport blocking materials however thus far despite several potential advantages including highly controlled layer deposition conductivity manipulation using doping techniques easily varied device architecture and diverse library of compatible materials with proven charge transport characteristics fully vacuum processed perovskite pvs have not been investigated herein we demonstrate the use of ch nh pbix clx active layers in combination with an industry standard etm and variety of vapor deposited htms this study provides direct comparison between perovskite and organic pv device architectures while easily tuning the htm to minimize energetic losses and improve overall efficiency additionally the relationships identified here are easily transferable and can help guide molecular design of new htms in the field of solution processed perovskite pv standard i device architecture

of the perovskite layer was achieved via dual source vapor deposition of lead ii chloride and methylammonium iodide to form the perovskite in situ using methods similar to those previously reported perovskite film formation was confirmed using grazing incidence ray diffraction which also indicated the presence of excess lead halide in the film g figure of the supplementary material incomplete perovskite formation likely led to reduced solar cell performance compared to literature examples see below however particular care was taken to maintain consistent film quality throughout this study allowing for direct comparison of the htms further details concerning the evaporation of all materials can be found in the supplementary material in addition to the spiro meo tad reference five other

triarylamine derivatives whose hole transport properties are well known from their previous use in the field of organic electronics it was expected that maintaining structural similarity would provide minimal effect on other device characteristics such as morphology interface compatibility and mobility however to ensure efficient charge transport through the layers the doping ratio of each material was optimized to maintain relatively consistent conductivity values above cm each material was initially tested at wt doping of either tcnnq htms or ndp htm in the case of htms and this doping ratio resulted in conductivities well below the range of the other htms cm therefore an increased doping ratio of wt was used for these materials in order to achieve comparable conductivity values figure of the supplementary material diagram depicting the energy levels of each material is provided in figure the ea value for was determined using inverse photoelectron spectroscopy ipes and the ip values noted for the ch nh pbi xclx perovskite and htms ref were determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ups htms provide progressively larger ip values approaching and exceeding that of the perovskite layer in order to determine the energetic limit at which the highest voc and efficiency is achieved without significant adverse losses the solar to electrical power conversion efficiencies were evaluated by recording the v characteristics under simulated am conditions mw cm detailed photovoltaic parameters jsc voc ff and for all materials are reported in table and average values with standard deviation for the solar cell characteristics are compared in figure these values are derived from devices fabricated on individual substrates via identical methods as expected while the jsc and ff remain relatively constant for devices employing an increase in the ip of the htm results in greater average voc and corresponding increase in efficiency however devices employing htm show marked decrease in both jsc and voc presumably due to hole extraction difficulties in absence of driving force between the htm and perovskite layers the effect is even more pronounced in devices employing htm not pictured due to axis scale where the imposed energy barrier for charge extraction leads to very low efficiency cells the v characteristics of the best performing cells employing htms are depicted in figure and maintain the trend observed for the average values the overall highest efficiency devices were obtained using htms and with similar jsc voc and ff leading to matched overall power conversion efficiencies of up to as consequence of the increased ip the efficiency of these devices far surpassed that of the device with htm mainly due to an increase in the measured voc mv figure shows the external quantum efficiency eqe as function of the light excitation wavelength for devices employing the traces are characterized by three main peaks in the nm range with maximum eqe as high as the spectral response was measured without bias illumination and for this reason we did not expect the integration of the curve to exactly match that of the measured jsc for all samples however there is strong correlation to the trend observed for the v characteristics fully vacuum deposited planar heterojunction ch nh pbix clx perovskite solar cells were fabricated in combination with p doped hole transport layer and c electron transport layer series of hole transport materials with ionization potentials ranging from to ev were investigated to study the influence of improved energy level alignment on the device performance devices employing materials with ionization potentials of up to ev yielded improved open circuit voltages and corresponding power conversion efficiencies however beyond this range the absence of driving force for hole extraction lead to dramatic decrease in both the short circuit current density and open circuit voltage as such this work has identified an optimal range for the ionization potential of the hole transport material in ch nh pbix clx perovskite solar cells leading to power conversion efficiency values of up to this corresponds to improvement over identical devices fabricated with commonly used spiro meo tad  lithium zirconates have attracted researchers interests because they can also be used as solid sorbents for co capture the structural electronic and phonon properties of li zro li zr and monoclinic phase zro are investigated by the density functional theory and phonon dynamics their electrochemical properties and their thermodynamics of co absorption desorption are analyzed the calculated results show that their optimized structures and calculated bulk moduli as well as cohesive energies are in good agreement with experimental measurements the calculated band gaps are ev indirect ev direct and ev direct for li zro li zr and zro respectively the calculated li intercalation voltage and energy densities of li zro are higher than that of li zr which indicates that as cathode material li zro is better than li zr the calculated phonon dispersions and density of states show that there is one soft mode in li zro and two soft modes in li zr from the calculated thermodynamic properties of these two lithium zirconates reacting with co we found that the performance of li zro as co sorbent is better than that of li zr in the first half cycle sorbents absorbing co to form lithium carbonate li zr performs better than li zro because the former releases more heat of reaction and has lower gibbs free energy and higher co capture capacity however during the second half cycle regenerating sorbent from carbonate and zirconia to release co the main product is the thermodynamically favorable li zro rather than forming li zr as solid electrolytes lithium salts li sio li zro etc are widely used in high energy lithium secondary batteries since they are both ionic conductors and of the ternary oxides that are thermodynamically stable against li lithium meta zirconate li zro is also one of the best candidate blanket materials for tritium breeding components in the deuterium tritium fusion reactor moreover lithium zirconates are good piezoelectric ceramics nowadays the burning of fossil fuels is the main energy source for the world economy one consequence of the use of these carbon based fuels is the emission of huge quantities of co into the atmosphere creating environmental problems such as global climate warming one approach to solving such environmental problems is to capture and sequester the co experimental investigations conducted in the past few decades found new application that lithium zirconates are good candidates of solid sorbents for co capture in terms of large co sorption capacity infinite co or co selectivity good reversibility and high operating temperature nakagawa and ohashi first reported that lithium zirconate powder reacts immediately with ambient co in the temperature range of and the products decompose reversibly to lithium zirconate and co at temperatures above ida et al pointed out that the rate of the co sorption on pure zirconate is controlled by the diffusion of co in the solid lithium carbonate shell whereas xiong et al revealed that it is the size of the aggregate of li zro that controls the co sorption rate lithium zirconate based membrane has high separation factor of between co and ch gas molecules at recent experimental results also indicated that doping or mixing lithium zirconates with other alkali salts could improve the co sorption pfeiffer et al reported that hexa lithium zirconate li zr absorbed four times more co than li zro and its co sorption rate is faster than li zro at short times but they became similar after long times ochoa fernandez et al showed that the nanocrystalline tetragonal li zro has superior co capture and regeneration properties when compared to monoclinic li zro prepared by solid state synthesis their results demonstrated that both the capture rate and capacity of lithium zirconate depend considerably on the ratio of li to zro and the enhanced capture rates were observed when deficiency of li is introduced where excess zro as dispersant introduces more reactive boundaries recently they also investigated the effects of steam addition to the stability of li zro in the co capture process and showed that while the presence of steam enhances the capture and regeneration rates there is large decay in the absorption capacity when compared with dry capture condition by means of thermodynamics calculation and experimental measurements nakagawa and ohashi pointed out that the change from li zro to zro depends not only on temperature and co partial pressure but also on the presence of molten carbonates g alkali carbonates with molar ratio of li very recently iwan et al explored the equilibrium and kinetics of co reacting with li zro and found that at high temperatures its reaction rate is considerably fast they also observed relatively slow reaction rates at pco bar possibly due to mass transfer limitations the mechanisms of these reversible reactions are not clear essaki et al proposed reaction model for lithium zirconate absorption of co at room temperature the co reacts with li in the li zro to form li co if o is present the co and li first will hydrolyze before forming li co however they did not explain how the li migrated out of li zro bulk structure nor did they describe the ensuing changes to the li zro bulk structure ida et al also proposed similar double shell model to describe the co sorption mechanism on li zro from qualitative point of view they found that in order to continue to form li co the lithium has to migrate and cross the li co shell the rate of the co absorption is controlled by the diffusion of co into the solid lithium carbonate shell and the aggregate size with the li zro bulk even with these shells on the co absorption process it was not clearly known as to how the li zro structure changes to zro and how the li comes out of li zro structure to react with the co in comparison to the previously cited extensive experimental studies on lithium zirconates and related materials in the literature there are few theoretical studies particularly on the electronic structure and lattice dynamics of these lithium zirconates using pseudohomogeneous and heterogeneous models rusten et al simulated fixed bed reactor for the production of hydrogen via sorption enhanced steam methane reforming using li zro as co acceptor pfeiffer and bosch used molecular dynamics to investigate the thermal stability and co absorption of li zr their results indicated that the best temperature for co absorption on li zr is and that the li zr does not regenerate after the co desorption but instead decomposes into li zro in contrast to lithium zirconates in the literature the electronic structural properties of zirconia have been extensively investigated our previous results of li capturing co showed that li is good at absorbing co but the reverse reaction to release co can occur only at very low pressure and very high temperature in this study we first employ first principles density functional method to investigate the electronic structural and the lattice dynamical phonon properties of li zro and li zr extensively then analyze in detail the properties of co absorption desorption based on the energetic and thermal dynamical results the remainder of this report is organized as follows in sec ii we briefly describe the theoretical method we employed in sec iii we present the electronic and phonon results for lithium zirconates and compare them with other available data we then analyze their electrochemical properties by calculating the open circuit voltage and energy densities subsequently we analyze their capabilities for co capture by calculating the chemical potential change for the capture reactions under different external pressures and temperatures in sec iv we summarize our conclusions theoretical the calculations performed in this work are based on first principles density functional theory dft with plane wave basis sets and the pseudopotential to describe the electron ion interactions the vienna ab initio simulation package was employed in this study to calculate the electronic structures of the lithium zirconates and zirconia materials in this study all calculations have been done using the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials and the pw exchange correlation functional this computational level was shown to provide an accurate description of oxide systems plane wave basis sets were used with cutoff energy of ev and kinetic energy cutoff for augmentation charges of ev the point sampling grids of n obtained using the monkhorst pack method were used for these bulk calculations where n and were determined consistent to spacing of about along the axes of the reciprocal unit cells the corresponding point sets that we used in our calculations were for li zro for li zr and for zro respectively the valence electrons contain the and orbitals of li and atoms and the p and orbitals of zr during the calculations all atoms in the cell as well as the lattice dimensions and angles were relaxed to the equilibrium configurations for band structure and phonon dispersion calculations the symbols and coordinates of the high symmetrical points in the first brillouin zone of the crystals are taken from bradley and cracknell definitions when applying these two lithium zirconates as solid co absorbents we have the following reactions li zro co pli co zro li zr co p li co zro li zr co p li co zro li zro li zr co pli co li zro obviously the product li zro from reactions and can further absorb co by reaction and finally become reaction assuming the difference between the chemical potential of solid phases li zro li zr zro and li co can be approximated by the differences in their electronic energies edft and their entropies sharm and harmonic free energies fharm we can obtain the temperature and pressure dependent chemical potential for these reactions p nrt ln pco with edft ezp fharm t sharm gco where ezp is the zero point energy difference between the reactants and products and can be obtained directly from phonon calculations in eq is the number of moles of absorbed co in reactions d is the standard state reference pressure of bar the free energy of co gco can be obtained by standard statistical mechanics gco rt nah ieh kt tsco where na is the avogadro constant the vibrational frequencies of co molecule are cm cm and cm from which the zero point energy of co molecule is obtained with the value of ev the entropy of co sco in mol can be accurately evaluated using the shomate equation sco a ln b c d e g where t and b d and are parameters for co in the temperature range of their values are and respectively the enthalpy change for the reactions d hcal can be derived from above equations as hcal t nsco sharm when considering the phase stability and transitions and the thermodynamics of crystalline materials their fundamental properties are the phonon frequencies the approaches of ab initio calculations fall into two classes the linear response method in which the dynamical matrix is expressed in terms of the inverse dielectric matrix describing the response of the valence electron density to periodic lattice perturbation and the direct method in which the forces are calculated via the hellmann feynman theorem here in this paper we employ the phonon software package in which the direct method is applied following the formula derived by parlinski et al to combine ab initio dft with phonon calculations similar to our previous approach the phonon dispersion and the thermodynamic properties zero point energy free energy change entropy change etc can be carried out for each crystal in turn the zero point energy change ezp and the phonon free energy change fharm in eq are obtained for the co capture reactions d in the phonon calculations supercell is created for zro and li zro from their optimized unit cells that are calculated through dft in order to make the shape of the supercell close to cubic and to take into account the proper size of the cell for li zr a supercell which contains eight formula units of li zr is used for its phonon property calculations the displacement of of nonequivalent atoms is generated then for the supercell the dft calculations were performed again to obtain the force on each atom due to the displacements these forces are carried back to the phonon package to calculate the phonon dispersions and density of states the partition function can be carried out with the phonon dispersions and densities of states with them their thermodynamic properties such as internal energy free energy entropy heat capacity etc can be evaluated under different temperature and pressure which are used in eq to calculate the chemical potentials for the reactions d structural optimization and bulk lithium zirconates can be synthesized from li co and zro with different ratios recently yin et al reported that substituting li co with lioh can obtain li zro and li zr and furthermore substituting zro with zr no o can obtain li zr with decreased synthesis time although its tetragonal metastable phase could exist lithium meta zirconate li zro usually is in monoclinic structure with space group c no at low temperature k its crystal constants are b and in which zr is located at site li occupies sites and and atoms are located at sites and as shown by heiba and el sayed there were large anisotropic changes in its lattice parameters as function of temperature slight changes in the fractional coordinates of different atoms and anisotropic changes in the interatomic distances between the different cations hexa lithium zirconate li zr also has monoclinic structure with space group c no by comparing the structure of li zro with that of li zr it can be seen that both of them are of the nacl type however the distributions of the cations are different in these two phases and therefore they can not be considered isostructural as shown in fig in li zro all cations have octahedral coordination and its structure has to be considered as close packed whereas the structure of li zr is more open and both li and ions in li zr may have higher mobility that leads to higher ionic conductivity than li zro does although zirconia zro can be presented in several different crystal structures under different temperatures and pressures at ambient condition it presents monoclinic structure with space group c no here for the purpose of investigating the thermodynamic properties of the co capture reactions we only deal with its ambient phase the crystal structures of these two zirconates and most stable monoclinic zro phase are shown in fig their experimental crystal structural constants as well as our optimized structural constants are summarized in table from fig it can be seen that there are u in each unit cell in li zr each zr atom coordinated with six and li atoms is located close to the zr layered is located along direction not exactly parallel to on each layer zr is planar coordinated with four whereas between each layer zr is bonded with similar layered structures can also be seen in the structure of li zro but on each zr layer half of the zr is distorted above the plane and half of the zr is below the plane from table one can see that the deviations of our optimized structures of li zro and li zr from the corresponding experimental measurements are less than in order to explore the bulk properties of lithium zirconates we calculate their total energies versus the changes of cell volume from them we can obtain the relationship between energy and volume or pressure by fitting the equation of state the most popular and well widely used equation of state is the birch murnaghan equation of state v v b v b v v by fitting the calculated data of v into eq the bulk properties of solids can be obtained the fitted results of these lithium zirconates and zirconia are listed in table ii the bulk modulus is defined as b p in this scheme where is the pressure and here is set to atm the cohesive energy ec is calculated by subtracting the total bulk energy in table ii from the sum of total energies of the related atoms such as li zr using the same level calculations in our case we get eli ev ezr ev and eo ev the calculated ec as well as other values from references are listed in table ii from table ii one can see that the calculated bulk modulus of zro gpa is close to those fitted and experimental measured values made by bouvier et al and dewhurst et al the calculated cohesive energy of monoclinic zro ev is between the experimental value of ev and the local density approximation calculated result of ev we also made the dft calculations for other five phases of zro space group numbers and our results show that the monoclinic phase has the lowest energy which is consistent with the experimental results that the monoclinic phase is most stable under ambient conditions and also consistent with zt rk and durandurdu recent calculated results however in the report of lowther et al the relative energy of monoclinic zro is lower than two cubic phases nos and but about ev atom higher than other three phases nos and therefore in our following phonon and co capture calculations only the monoclinic phase of zro is considered comparing li zro with li zr one can see from table ii that their bulk moduli are close to each other but li zr has much higher cohesive energy than li zro electronic structural the calculated band structures of lithium zirconates li zro li zr and monoclinic zro are shown in fig it can be seen that the band structures of these three materials have some similarities they have two valence bands vbs and their shapes look similar to each other their second vbs are located below ev while their first vbs are just below the fermi energy the calculated band gap of li zro is an indirect one located between and high symmetric points with the value of ev while the calculated band gaps of li zr and zro are direct with the values of and ev as shown in figs and respectively obviously the calculated values of their band gaps are close to each other however as described in our previous work the dft calculation underestimated the excited state energy the calculated band gaps are usually smaller than the experimental measurements although currently there is no experimental value available for comparison as summarized in table iii the band widths of the first and second vbs for li zr and li zro have only about ev difference while zro has larger first valence band width figure shows the calculated total density of states and their corresponding atom partial density of states for li zro li zr and monoclinic zro as demonstrated in fig the orbital of contributes to the lower second vbs of li zro li zr and zro while its orbitals are mainly contributed to their first vbs in all three cases all the p and orbitals of zr contribute to both vbs but its orbitals have higher contributions than its and orbitals from figs and it can be seen that when compared with its orbital the orbital of li has larger contribution to the upper portion of the first vb in both li zro and li zr from figs and one can see that in both li zro and li zr each zr atom is coordinated with six atoms and around each atom is bonded to two zr atoms the distances between zr and in li zro are and in li zr are the differences between these two structures are mainly caused by the distributions of li atoms their structure similarities give similar band structures electrochemical properties of lithium lithium zirconates could be used as cathode materials their electrochemical properties can be derived directly from the difference in total energies before and after lithium intercalation this procedure can improve the accuracy through the cancellation of errors typically the cathode discharge assumes the half cell reaction versus li li linzrmok xli xe lin xzrmok the open circuit voltage ocv for an intercalation reaction involving li ions can be evaluated from the energy difference if volume and entropy effects are neglected ocv linzrmok xe li metal lin xzrmok xf where is the faraday constant the energy density in wh and the specific energy em in wh kg for battery reaction are given bye em em where is the energy difference between the reactant linzrmok and product lin xzrmok is the mean volume of u of reactant and u of product in the discharge reaction and is the mean mass of u of reactant and u of product using the same calculating procedure for li metal the calculated li metal ev atom from table it can be seen that when removing one li from li zro there are two possibilities corresponding to upper and lower layers of li as shown in fig for the case of li zr as shown in table and fig it contains three different groups of li and each group has two li in order to keep the crystal symmetry as high as possible instead of removing one li we remove two li atoms from li zr creating three possible configurations of li zr therefore in this work the ocvs are calculated for li zr with and for li zro with in eq respectively the optimized lattice parameters for the reduced lithium zirconates are listed in table iv cases c correspond to removing different types of li atoms shown in table one by one comparing table iv with table one can see that removing different sets of li results in different structures and electrochemical properties due to the different environments of these li sets in the crystal structures as shown in figs and interestingly except for case of lizro after removing one set of li the crystal structures are expanded because of more repulsions caused by less li and almost all atoms in the crystal rearranged to new equilibrium the calculated ocv energy density and the specific energy em of their lithium intercalation reactions for li zro and li zr are also summarized in table iv obviously from eqs and if the cell energy of the reduced crystal is lower its ocv and em should be higher however their energy density could be lower because it also depends on the cell volume as shown in eq the difference of the calculated ocv between two cases of li zro lizro is while in the case of li zr li zr the difference is about comparing li zro with li zr one can see that the li zro has higher ocv energy density and specific energy which means that as cathode material li zro is better than li zr dynamical phonon as shown in table for each solid there are u in each unit cell however the primitive cells of li zro and li zr only contain u while the primitive cell of monoclinic zro still contains u therefore there are phonon modes in li zr and phonon modes in li zro and zro the calculated phonon dispersions of lithium zirconates li zro li zr and monoclinic phase of zro are shown in figs c respectively in table we summarize our calculated phonon frequencies of these three solids together with the corresponding irreducible representations unfortunately in the literature we did not find any experimental or theoretical data to compare with obviously all of the vibrational modes are nondegenerate au ag bu and bg because their crystal point groups are quite low with h and half of them are raman active and the other half infrared active as shown in table it can be seen from figs and that along the wave vector there are some soft modes in these two lithium zirconates in the case of li zro fig one soft mode belonging to acoustical branch is around the high symmetric points and in the dispersion curve of li zr as shown in fig there are two soft modes along the wave vectors and in the case of monoclinic zro as shown in fig no obvious soft mode was found however using similar approach sternik and parlinski found soft model branch in the cubic phase of zro and considered it as an ensemble of independent anharmonic oscillators of the parabola gaussian or of the polynomial forms from fig one can see that in all three solids the lowest three modes one longitudinal la au and two transverse ta bu at point which frequencies are very close to zero as shown in table represent the motion of mass center and are infrared active as we know during phonon dispersion calculations the translational rotational invariance conditions for these solids are not fulfilled because the phonon package does not know which independent parameters of the force constants should be renormalized in order to obey the translational rotational invariance consequently the acoustic phonon modes may not begin at the zero frequency at the center of the brillouin zone therefore the calculated frequencies at points as shown in fig and table are not exactly zero but very close to cm as shown in table the calculated phonon density of states of lithium zirconates and zirconia is shown in fig as one can see that there are some similarities among these three compounds their frequencies span up to thz and the number of high frequency modes is small and forming separate band as shown in fig from the partial density of states of each displaced atom and the polarization vector analysis not show in the figure overall it can be found that the higher frequency region thz in fig comes from the displacements while the lower frequency region thz in fig comes from the zr displacements among the middle range thz the vibrational frequencies are from all types of atoms among them zr vibrations mainly contribute to the low portion of this range thz as shown in fig and table each element may have more than one type with different coordination environments in the crystal therefore their phonon dispersion behaviors are also different the soft mode in li zro is mainly from zr displacements with one type of li displacements while the soft modes in li zr are mainly from zr displacements with small contribution from vibration the calculated phonon free energy of each solid versus temperature is shown in fig from which the zero point energies can be obtained and are listed in table iii in order to explore their properties of capturing co the thermodynamic properties of li zro are also shown in the same figure as one can see the zero point energies of these solids are significant and must be included into predicting their thermodynamic properties eq from fig one can see that at low temperature li zr has higher free energy compared with li zro however when the temperature is increased its free energy decreased rapidly figure shows the calculated entropies of these solids versus the temperatures obviously at their entropies are zero and increase with increasing temperature as shown in table iii similar to other systems of larger number of solids our calculated entropies of these three solids at room temperature are quite close to the experimental measured values which indicate that our theoretical approach can achieve reasonable results and therefore can be used to evaluate other unknown systems by including these free energies and entropies at different temperatures into eqs and the thermodynamic properties of the reactions of lithium zirconates capturing co can be evaluated as described in sec iii capabilities of lithium zirconates capture from experimental investigations lithium zirconates are good candidates of solid sorbents for co capture in terms of large co sorption capacity infinite co or co selectivity good reversibility and high operating temperature according to eq the calculated heat of reaction enthalpy change for reactions d versus the temperatures is plotted in fig and also summarized in table vi for comparison the available experimental data for the reaction of li zro capturing co from hsc chemistry database are also shown in fig for the reaction of li zro capture co as seen in fig the data from hsc chemistry database have two discontinuities at temperatures of and which correspond to the solid solid phase transitions of the product li co at those temperatures however in the literature there is no crystal structure available for those high solid phases of li co therefore as an approximation we used the structure of its low phase to represent its structure in high range the temperature effects were partially taken into account by phonon dynamics at different temperature without specific phase transition that is why in fig the simulated enthalpy of the li zro capture co reaction does not have discontinuity compared to the hsc data as one can see from fig overall our calculated heat of reaction for li zro is close to the data from hsc chemistry database especially in the temperature range of which is the temperature range for co capture since there are no experimental data available for li zr in fig only our calculated reaction heats of li zr capturing co reaction d are plotted from them one can see that li zr absorbs co to form lithium carbonate and lithium meta zirconate li zro and the li zro can further absorb co to dissociate to most stable zro according to eq for the reactions of lithium zirconates capturing co we can explore the relationship among the chemical potential p the temperature and the co pressure pco this kind of relationship for reactions d is shown in fig the line in fig indicates that for each reaction the p is approaching zero around the line is good region for the absorption and desorption because of the minimum energy costs at the given temperature and pressure above the line the solid li zro li zr is favorable to absorb co and to form li co while below the line the li co is favorable to release co and regenerate lithium zirconate solids back as described above and shown in fig all of these reactions are thermodynamically favorable over quite wide range of temperatures and pco which means that under this temperature range the co is thermodynamically favored by lithium zirconates but as co solid sorbent the sorbent should not only be easy to absorb the co in the first half cycle but also easy to release the co from products li co and zro for example in the second half cycle the operating conditions for absorption desorption processes are depending on the pre and postcombustion technologies under precombustion conditions after water gas shifting the gas stream mainly contains co o and the partial co pressure is around bar and the temperature is around to minimize the energy consumption the ideal sorbents should work at these pressure and temperature ranges to separate co from this temperature denoted is listed in table vi and is the temperature above which the lithium zirconates cannot absorb co anymore and will start to release co this indicates that during the first half cycle to capture co the operating temperature should be lower than whereas the operating temperature may be higher than depending on the desired obtained co pressure during the second half cycle of sorbents regeneration to release co for postcombustion conditions the gas stream mainly contains co and the partial pressure of co is around bar and the temperature range is quite different however the low temperature capture is desired the doe programmatic goal for postcombustion co capture is to capture at least co with the cost in electricity no more than whereas in the case of precombustion co capture the goal is to capture at least co with the cost in electricity no more than the turnover temperatures denoted as for postcombustion capture by these two lithium zirconates are also listed in table vi from table vi and fig one can see that these two lithium zirconates capture co up to higher temperatures k compared with desired precombustion condition therefore they are not good sorbents for capturing co in precombustion technology however they could be used for high temperature postcombustion co capture with and for li zro and li zr respectively as experimental results indicate that li zro reacts immediately with ambient co pco bar in the range of and products react and return reversibly to lithium zirconate at temperatures above from fig one can see that during the first half cycle of absorbing co the li zr can be fully converted into zro and li co because the partial reactions and do not gain any energetic advantage interestingly during the second half cycle of capturing when the li co and the zro react with each other to release co and regenerate the sorbent back only li zro can be regenerated as shown in fig the reaction curve of li zro capturing co is always higher than the other three curves of li zr reacting with co therefore the regeneration first forms li zro not li zr the li zr can only be formed either at low co pressure fixed or at high temperature pco fixed through li zro further reacting with li co and zro in order words no matter what the initial solid is li zro or li zr after first sorption desorption cycle the following cycle is only for the reaction li zro co li co zro and there is no li zr left in the system this is in good agreement with the experimental findings as pfeiffer et al reported that the hexa lithium zirconate li zr absorbed four times more co than li zro and its co sorption rate is faster than li zro at short times but after long times their capture behaviors became similar this result indicates that there is no advantage to use li zr over li zro as co sorbent because they have the same functionality after the first cycle from table vi and fig one can see that the reverse reaction is not just to dissociate li co but also to regenerate li zro from li by reacting with zro which involves net energy gain and lay down the conditions for compared with the case of li in other words the presence of zro can destabilize the stable phase of li co and make the reverse reaction to release co less energy required the electronic structural and phonon properties of li zro li zr and monoclinic phase zro are investigated by the density functional theory and phonon dynamics their electrochemical properties and the thermodynamic properties of co absorption desorption are analyzed the optimized structures and calculated bulk modulus and cohesive energy are in good agreement with experimental measurements the calculated band gaps are ev indirect ev direct and ev direct for li zro li zr and zro respectively the orbital of contributes to the lower second vbs of li zro li zr and zro while its orbitals mainly contribute to their first vbs in all three cases all the p and orbitals of zr contribute to both vbs but its orbitals have higher contributions than its and orbitals in both li zro and li zr comparing with its orbital the orbital of li has larger contribution to the upper portion of their first vbs by assuming half cell reaction versus li li the calculated li intercalation open circuit voltages and energy densities of li zro are higher than that of li zr which indicate that as cathode material li zro is better than li zr the phonon dispersions and phonon density of states for li zro and li zr were calculated by the direct method for li zro around the high symmetric points and there is one soft mode that originates mainly from displacing zr atoms and displacing one type of li atoms in li zr among the high symmetric point intervals and there are two soft modes which are mainly from zr displacements with small contribution from vibration based on the phonon dispersion the phonon free energy the internal energy and the entropy of these solids were evaluated within the harmonic approximation and have been used to analyze the chemical potentials of the reactions of co capture by these two lithium zirconates from the calculated thermodynamical properties of these two lithium zirconates reacting with co we found that overall the performances of li zro capturing co are better than that of li zr in the first half cycle for the sorbent to absorb co to form lithium carbonate li zr is better than li zro because the former reaction releases more heat of reaction and has lower gibbs free energy and higher co capture capacity however during the second half cycle to regenerate the sorbent from carbonate and zirconia and to release co instead of forming li zr the main product is the thermodynamically favorable li zro therefore compared with li zro there is no advantage for using li zr as co sorbent  sulfonated poly ether ether ketone peek with of degree of sulfonation was studied using full atomistic molecular dynamics simulation in order to investigate the nanophase segregated structures focusing on the sulfonate group and water phase at various water contents such as and wt by analyzing the pair correlation function it is found that as the water solvation of sulfonate groups proceeds more with increasing water content the distance between sulfonate groups is increased from wt to wt to wt and the hydronium ions o become farther apart from the sulfonate groups the water coordination number for water and the water diffusion are enhanced with increasing water content because the internal structure of the water phase in peek approaches that of bulk water compared to the nafion and dendrion membranes the peek membrane shows less internal structure in the water phase and smaller water diffusion indicating that the peek has less nanophase segregation than the nafion and dendrion membranes although the perfluorosulfonic acid pfsa type of polymers such as nafion have attracted enormous attention from the polymer electrolyte membrane pem fuel cell community due to their high proton conductivity and excellent chemical stability the drawbacks of this pfsa based polymers such as high cost in production drastic decrease in proton conductivity with dehydration and poor fuel crossover in direct methanol fuel cell have also stimulated another intensive study in developing non pfsa based polymers especially sulfonated hydrocarbon based polymers such as sulfonated poly ether ether ketone peek sulfonated poly styrene ps and sulfonated poly benzimidazole peek fig has been known as one of the promising candidates for fuel cell application since it has high thermo oxidative stability and extraordinary mechanical properties as well as high cost effectiveness from fig it should be noticed that peek has sulfonate groups directly attached to the backbone in comparison with nafion that has sulfonate groups on its side chains kobayashi et al reported that the peek can have high proton conductivity of cm at room temperature kreuer found that the membrane made of peek has narrower and less connected hydrophilic channels compared to that of nafion which causes reduction in the electro osmotic drag and water permeation in addition to the lower proton conductivity than nafion zaidi et al observed an enhancement in proton conductivity from the composite membrane consisting of peek and solid heteropolyacids recently kaliaguine et al reported that the proton conductivity and mechanical strength of the peek membranes are affected by the casting solvent which explains the reason for the broad range of experimental data on the membrane properties xing et al found that the proton conductivity of peek is increased with increasing degree of sulfonation ds even though the amount of studies on this material have been growing so far we still lack knowledge about its various properties such as nanophase segregated structure water diffusion and so on furthermore the relationship between such nanophase segregated structure and the transport properties has not been thoroughly discussed at the molecular level since kreuer discussed that the peek membrane has less segregated morphology than the nafion in this context the molecular dynamics md simulation has been noticed in the fuel cell community as useful tool providing detailed information on the polymer membrane at various thermodynamic conditions indeed massive amount of md studies have been published recently such md simulation techniques have been successfully used to investigate the nanophase segregation and transport property of hydrated nafion membrane and thus the simulated structures and properties have been widely taken into account to understand underpinning physics of the pem fuel cell in collaboration with experimental observations it should be noticed however that most of the md simulation studies have been biased toward the nafion membrane system while the peek membrane has not been seriously simulated yet even though it is very desirable to obtain information on the structure and properties at the molecular level in the present study therefore we have investigated the hydrated peek membrane using full atomistic md simulation approach in order to characterize the nanophase segregated structure especially focusing on the distribution and the solvation of the sulfonate groups in the presence of water for the fuel cell application the simulation results for the peek membrane are discussed in comparison with the experimental data available in literatures as well as those for the nafion membrane all simulations were carried out using full atomistic model of peek in order to analyze the effect of hydration on the structures and properties of the membrane various water contents such as and wt were introduced in the membrane please note that we do not apply an external electric field in our simulation we used the dreiding force field generic force field for materials as previously used to study nafion and dendrion as well as various molecular systems such as hydrogel liquid liquid and liquid air interfaces and molecular self assembly the water was described using the c force field these force field parameters are described in the original papers and in our previous study on hydrated nafion thus the force field has the forme totevdw eq ebond eangle etorsion einversion where etot evdw eq ebond eangle etorsion and einversion are total energies van der waals electrostatic bond stretching angle bending torsion and inversion components respectively the individual atomic charges of the copolymer were assigned using the charge equilibration method optimized to reproduce the mulliken charges of small molecules the atomic charges of water molecule were from the c water model the particle particle particle mesh method was used to calculate the electrostatic interactions all the annealing and md simulations were performed using the md code lammps large scale atomic molecular massively parallel simulator from plimpton et al at sandia with modifications to handle our force fields the equations of motion were integrated using the velocity verlet algorithm with time step of fs the nos hoover temperature thermostat for the nvt and npt md simulations used damping relaxation time of ps and the dimensionless cell mass factor of construction and equilibration of the amorphous the simulated hydrated membrane systems consist of two chains of peek and water molecules for and wt as summarized in table the degree of polymerization and the ds for the peek chain were set to and respectively fig the sulfonated monomers were selected randomly with degree of randomness of from monomeric units in the backbone and all of the sulfonic acid groups are assumed to be ionized as assumed in the previous studies the initial amorphous structures of hydrated peek were constructed in three dimensional periodic cell using the amorphous builder of cerius since such initial structures of polymeric materials may include unstable conformations they should be equilibrated first before analyzing the properties of our interest in this point it should also be stressed that the relaxation of polymers is very slow for standard equilibrium md to reach equilibrium states therefore in order to efficiently obtain well equilibrated structures for complex amorphous polymers we applied the annealing procedure as used in the previous studies of nafion and dendrion membranes which accelerates the attainment of equilibrium by driving the system repeatedly through cycles of thermal annealing between and and volume annealing between densities of times the expected density this procedure aims to help the system escape from various local minima and promote the migration of species required for phase segregation in heterogeneous systems whose detailed steps are described in the previous publications after finishing the thermal volume annealing cycles ps nvt md simulation and subsequent ps npt md simulation were performed at to finalize the annealing procedure then ns npt md simulations were performed at the same temperature to fully equilibrate the structure fig from which the last ns parts were chosen for the statistical analyses of properties the equilibrated densities obtained from the simulations are summarized in table in this point it should be noticed that there is no rigorous way to guarantee that simulated polymeric system is fully equilibrated although multiple indirect evidences can be found from the agreement of thermodynamic properties densities and energies between simulations and experiments therefore we presume the extent of equilibration in our simulations from leveled off trend of such thermodynamic properties as discussed in previous studies the nanophase segregation between hydrophobic polymer domain and water associated hydrophilic phase is the key variable in harnessing pem fuel cell for desirable properties since the water channel continuously distributed throughout membrane is essential for proton conduction since this water channel in nanophase segregation is formed with the strongly hydrophilic sulfonate groups we analyzed the spatial distribution of sulfonate group as function of water content figure shows the pair correlation functions for sulfur sulfur pairs gs r this pair correlation function ga r indicates the probability density of finding atoms at distance from atoms averaged over the equilibrium trajectory asga r nb r nbv where nb is the number of particle located at the distance in shell of thickness from particle nb is the number of particles in the system and is the total volume of the system in fig it is clearly shown that the peak observed for wt becomes weakened and broadened and the peak position is shifted to the farther distance with increasing water content from at at wt to at wt to at wt water content directly indicating that the distance between sulfonate groups increase as function of the water content first of all we compared the first peak of the pair correlation gs r hereafter the number density is multiplied for direct comparison in the hydrated peek membrane with those in the nafion and dendrions it is found that the position of the first peak that is the dominant distance between nearest neighboring sulfurs is ranged from to in various materials peek nafion and dendrion for wt of the water content however in contrast to the dendrion whose s distance is nearly constant regardless of water content due to the covalent connectivity between sulfurs the hydrated peek shows increasing s distance with increasing water content regarding the reason that the first peak position of gs r changed in the peek membrane we think this is because the sulfonate groups of peek are directly attached to the backbone chain and thus their locations are affected by the swelling induced conformational change in the backbone we found that this also agreed with the simulation study done by cui et al reporting that the shorter side chains of pfsa polymer were less affected by the hydration than the longer side chains of nafion to quantitatively characterize this we checked the volume expansion due to the increasing water content as summarized in table the volume of membrane with and wt of water content is increased by and respectively in comparison with that with wt of water content however such shift of the first peak in fig and for and wt of water content respectively does not seem to be fully explained only by the volume expansion because the contribution from such volume expansion as function of water content would be just and on the average for and wt of water content respectively assuming that the swelling affects the interatomic distance homogeneously throughout the system y for wt of water content and for wt of water content where y and are the increment of system size in the y and axis directions as shown in fig therefore we need to think of another source for this peak shift which is the solvation of sulfonate group figures and show the pair correlation function for sulfur oxygen water pairs gs water and sulfur oxygen hydronium pairs gs hydronium respectively giving us direct information on how many water or hydronium surround the sulfonate group from fig it is clear that the intensity of the peak ranging at increases as the water content increases without shift of the peak position which indicates that the number of water molecules surrounding sulfonate groups is increased with increasing water content on the contrary it is observed that gs hydronium peak is decreased with increasing water content we think that this trend is due to the solvation of hydronium as well as sulfonate more water molecules solvate hydronium and sulfonate and thereby the electrostatic interaction between hydronium and sulfonate is screened by the water molecules which has been observed by cui et al in their simulation study on short side chain polymer membrane ssc and nafion for quantitative analysis the averaged number of water and hydronium molecules surrounding each sulfonate group so called the coordination number cn is counted for by integrating the first peaks in the pair correlation functions the limits of integration are from the start of the peak to the first minimum since we found that the position of such minimum does not change significantly with changing water content we used cutoff to be consistent the cn is summarized in fig and table ii which shows that the water cn for sulfonate is increased from to whereas the hydronium cn for sulfonate is decreased from to as function of water content additionally through this solvation shell analysis several interesting points are found first at lower water content wt the value of the hydronium cn is larger than considering that this is possible only when each sulfonate group has an extra hydronium partially shared with neighboring sulfonate groups the observation of higher hydronium cn at lower water content is consistent with the close distance between sulfonate groups shown in fig in other words at wt of water content the hydronium molecules are located near the sulfonate groups and sulfonate groups are distributed closely to each other so that one sulfonate group can have more than one hydronium around itself as the distance between sulfonate groups becomes larger by more water fig such hydronium sharing disappears and the hydronium cn becomes smaller another point in table ii is that the cn is smaller than the value of total number of water molecules number of sulfonate group although is widely used parameter to express the amount of water it is apt to be misunderstood as the number of water molecules per sulfonate group that is actually the definition of the water cn at lower water content is similar to the cn because relatively small amount of water molecules gather around the hydrophilic sulfonate groups rather than other hydrophobic places however once the place nearby the sulfonates is saturated at certain water content the excessive water molecules should form their own water phase which is much less correlated with sulfonate groups and hence the difference between cn and becomes larger and larger water phase in the since the water phase is used as proton conduction channel in the membrane extensive studies on the proton transfer in water and in pems have led to the general consensus that the proton diffusion rate in bulk water is four to eight times larger than in the hydrated membrane as summarized by kreuer and by paddison such high proton conduction in bulk water is attributed to well organized and compact hydrogen bonding network that aids efficient proton hopping in contrast it is generally known that the water phase in membranes has less developed internal structure due to the reduced hydrogen bond connectivity which leads to less proton conduction therefore it should be very desirable to investigate the internal structure of water phase in peek membrane as function of water content to achieve quantitative relationship between structure and performance of pem fuel cell in order to characterize the internal structure in the water phase dispersed within hydrated membrane we calculated go water water as shown in fig as observed in the previous simulation studies on nafion and dendrion the intensity of the pair correlation is increased with increasing water content meaning that as the water content is increased the structure of the water phase is developed more until it reaches the level of bulk water this structural development of water phase was also evaluated by counting the water cn surrounding each water molecule figure shows the change in the water cn for water molecule as function of water content in comparison with nafion and dendrions as well as bulk water first it is found that the water cn is increased with increasing water content which is because water molecules form their own phase and the portion of water molecules surrounded by neighboring water molecules is increased another point from fig is that the cn has larger value in the nafion and dendrion membrane than in the peek with the same water content this comparison indicates that hydrated membranes made of nafion or dendrions have more structured water phase than peek membranes as discussed in the previous study comparing poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe with ps and poly epichlorohydrin in dendrion membrane in terms of the extent of nanophase segregation this is because the structural development of water phase within the polymeric membrane is driven by the nanophase segregation between the polymer phase and the water phase thus more nanophase segregation is achieved using more hydrophobic polymer such as ptfe as more water molecules gather together to form the bulk waterlike structure that is the less hydrophobic peek retains relatively more dispersed water in its less nanophase segregated morphology which is consistent with the report from kreuer the volume fraction of such water phase in the membrane supports the structure development of water phase in the membrane the volume fraction of water phase in the membrane was calculated as follows volume fraction of water vfree no water vfree water vtot where vfree no water and vfree water are the free volume of the membrane using probe radius after and before removing water molecules respectively figure shows linear increase in the volume fraction of the water phase in the membrane as function of water content here it should be noticed that the simulation trend in fig has smaller slope than the reference line with slope the reference line with slope is the line on which the water volume fraction is increased with the same density regardless of the water content thus the result that observed line has smaller slope than the reference line meaning that the water phase becomes denser with increasing water content we think this is also consistent with the previous analysis for water cn via go water water claiming that the water phase develops its structure more as the membrane uptake more water content therefore it is be concluded in the hydrated peek membrane that the internal structure of water phase becomes similar to that of bulk water as the water content increases as addressed in the experimental and simulation studies on the transport in nanostructures it has been found that the diffusion of water is greater in more phase segregated structures because the phase segregated water molecules in membranes achieve more bulk waterlike structure within its phase and bulk water has higher proton diffusion rate than other water phases in this study we investigated the water diffusion with various water contents in the hydrated peek membrane by comparing with the work done by kreuer reporting that the diffusion of water is enhanced more in nafion than in sulfonated peek because of the wider water channels in nafion figure and table iii summarize the mean square displacement msd of water calculated from the final ns simulation part out of the ns trajectories and the corresponding diffusion coefficients respectively the diffusion coefficient was calculated from the linear part of the msd plot black colored lines in fig by assuming that they have normal diffusion with the following equation as shown in fig we calculated the diffusion coefficients using oxygen and hydrogen and found that the diffusion coefficients from each element are exactly the same limx r r where t and are the positions of water at certain time and at the beginning respectively first as shown in fig it is found that the diffusion of water is enhanced with increasing water content which is in accordance with the previous studies on the hydrated dendrions thus we think it is general feature of hydrated polymeric membranes that the water diffusion is enhanced in with increasing hydration as the internal structure of water phase becomes more developed at higher water content then we compared the simulated water diffusion coefficients with the available experimental values table iii even though the experimental peek membrane has higher ds than our simulated one this comparison was carried out using similar volume fraction of water phase with the assumption that similar water amount provide similar conditions such as structure and distribution of water phase table iii shows that the simulated diffusion coefficients have the same order of magnitude with the experimental ones indicating that our simulations described the water diffusion in the hydrated peek membrane reasonably however it is also observed that at the lower water content the simulated value is nine times larger than the experimental value while those values become similar with increasing water content we think this observation might be caused by the different levels of sulfonation of peek between our simulation and experiment because at lower water content the water molecule in highly sulfonated peek has stronger dipole charge electrostatic interaction with the sulfonate groups due to less electrostatic screening from other water molecules and consequently have lower diffusion coefficient this is consistent with our result that the sulfonates become less effective at binding with the water as the water content is increased which is observed in our gs water in this point despite good agreement between simulations and experiments as shown in table iii it should be necessary to mention about the limitation of full atomistic md simulation in studying the transport property through polymeric membrane because most of the polymer chain relaxations are not observed during short simulation in several decades of nanosecond thus it would be safe to have qualitative comparison among simulations since all simulations were performed using the same condition however it is still worth asking the origin of such good agreement in table iii currently we think that such agreement between simulation and experiment would be due to the nature of water dynamics in well developed nanophase segregated morphology in other words the water diffusion might proceed independent of the dynamic chain relaxation when the membrane has well developed nanophase segregation and well connected water channels this infers that the effect of chain relaxation on the water diffusion would be reduced at high water content next the water diffusion in this peek membrane is compared to that in the nafion and dendrion membranes it is clearly observed in fig that the simulated water diffusion coefficient in the peek is smaller than that in the nafion and dendrion membrane at wt of water content especially the water diffusion coefficient in the peek is smaller by one order of magnitude than that of the nafion membrane since the diffusion of water is facilitated in the more nanophase segregated structure our simulated diffusion coefficient indicates that the nanophase segregation between water phase and hydrophobic polymer phase is less in the peek membrane than in the nafion and dendrion membranes based on the current observation on this water diffusion it would be reasonable prediction that the proton diffusion in this peek membrane is also smaller than in the nafion and dendrion membranes using full atomistic simulation approach we investigated the peek of ds with various water contents and wt at the equilibrated morphology of hydrated peek membrane was obtained through ns npt md simulation after the annealing simulations in order to characterize the nanostructure of such hydrated peek membranes first we calculated the pair correlation function for sulfur sulfur pairs gs r showing that the position of the first peak is shifted from at wt of water content to at wt to at wt of water content respectively this result indicates that the sulfur sulfur distance is increased with increasing water content by investigating the pair correlation function of sulfur oxygen water gs water it is found that such an increase in the sulfur sulfur distance is due to the solvation of sulfonate group by water molecules as well as the volume expansion due to the hydration in addition analyzing gs water and gs hydronium it is found that the water cn of sulfonate is increased from to with increasing water content whereas the cn of hydronium for sulfonate is decreased from to from these results it is thought that the sulfonate groups and the hydroniums are solvated more by adding more water and thereby the distance between sulfonates groups is increased making the number of partially shared hydronium smaller the go water water was also analyzed as function of water content showing that the water cn for water increases with increasing water content we think this is the evidence that the water molecules form water phase instead of being spread though the membrane as the water content is increased thus the structure of such water phase seems to approach the bulk waterlike structure with more water on the other hand compared to the nafion and dendrion it is found that the peek has less developed internal structure in water phase which is consistent with the previous finding that the structural development in water phase depends on the nanophase segregation the water diffusion coefficients were calculated from the final ns part out of the ns npt md simulations it is found that the water diffusion is enhanced with increasing water content which was consistently observed in the simulation study of hydrated dendrion membranes besides through comparison with nafion and dendrion the observation that the water diffusion coefficient in the hydrated peek is smaller than in the hydrated nafion and dendrion membranes implies that the nanophase segregation in the hydrated peek membrane is less than that in the nafion and dendrion membranes  we have succeeded in fabricating li

dispersing toward fermi level documentclass pt minimal begin document it end document ef on approaching the point where sharp quasiparticle peak is clearly seen another band has the top of dispersion at ev at the point and exhibits strong downward dispersion toward the point the electronic structure of lic looks quite similar to that of x li ca la eu and yb although the weak intensity near the point is not observed in pristine graphene or graphite in order to see more clearly these dispersive features in the arpes spectra we have mapped out the band structure and show the result in fig the experimental band structure was obtained by taking the second derivative of arpes spectra and plotted it as function of wave vector and binding energy the band with the bottom at ev at the point is assigned to the band while the band with the top at ev at the point is the band all these spectral features are basically identical to those of pristine bilayer graphene shown in fig while we clearly identify additional bands around the point which resemble the band around the point these additional bands around the point are likely assigned to the bands folded by the periodic potential of intercalated li atoms but is hard to be explained in terms of the metallic free electron like li documentclass pt minimal begin document it end document or interlayer band because these bands do not show parabolic like energy dispersion and ii the fermi surface fs shape is well explained by the band folding as shown in the next section it is noted that band dispersion in the valence band region

midpoint of the top of the band and the bottom of the band is shifted by ev toward the high binding energy in lic compared with pristine bilayer graphene this band shift is consistent with the previous theoretical and experimental studies of li gic and is explained in terms of the shift of the chemical potential due to the charge transfer from li atoms we also find in figs and that there exists band gap of ev in pristine bilayer graphene possibly due to finite interaction with the sic substrate and it appears to be enhanced to ev in lic to elucidate the band folding effect on the near documentclass pt minimal begin document it end document ef electronic states we plotted in fig the arpes intensity of pristine bilayer graphene and c lic at documentclass pt minimal begin document it end document ef as function of two dimensional wave vector it is apparent that the observed fermi surface topology of lic is drastically different from that of pristine bilayer graphene in lic we observe two types of fss at the point of the graphene bz the fs has closed triangular shape surrounding the point and the fs is bigger than the fs and extends toward the point of the graphene bz we also find additional weak features and in fig s extends toward the point from the point of the graphene bz while is centered at the point showing snowflake like shape we think that the and fss are replicas of the and fss produced by the band folding due to the superstructure of intercalated li atoms in fact when we fold the and fss by following the reconstructed bz scheme solid lines in fig the newly created fs at the point fig shows good agreement with the experimental fs in fig we have estimated the electron carrier concentration in graphene sheet from the area of fs in the first bz as shown in fig the measured fs area gives electrons per two graphene sheets this indicates that li atoms sandwiched by two graphene sheets are fully ionized li and the observed snowflake shaped fs is due to the folded band moreover this fs volume is half of the theoretically predicted fs volume of cac consistent with the valency difference between ca to li all these experimental results indicated that li atoms are intercalated into the thinnest graphite bilayer graphene in well ordered manner as in bulk gic the successful intercalation of li atoms into bilayer graphene provides an important step to the new device technology like ion battery although graphite has been long used as an anode material in li ion battery it involves inherent difficulties such as the long charging time and the large volume change upon the charge discharge cycle recently several proposals have been made with the nano scale materials such as si alloy nanowire and transition metal oxides to overcome the above mentioned difficulties and achieve the higher charge discharge rate with far less volume change li intercalated bilayer graphene would be good candidate for developing such new nano scale ion battery in summary we reported the fabrication and characterization of li intercalated bilayer graphene the leed and arpes measurements show that li atoms deposited onto bilayer graphene are fully ionized and take the same documentclass pt minimal begin document sqrt end document documentclass pt minimal begin document sqrt end document documentclass pt minimal begin document it end document superstructure as in bulk li this indicates that li atoms deposited onto bilayer graphene are intercalated between two adjacent graphene layers in the same well ordered manner as in bulk li this success of fabrication of li intercalated bilayer graphene would open way to developing nano scale ion battery  the ability to control ion temperatures is critical for gas phase spectroscopy and has been challenge in chemical physics low temperature photoelectron spectroscopy instrument has been developed for the investigation of complex anions in the gas phase including multiply charged anions solvated species and biological molecules the new apparatus consists of an electrospray ionization source three dimensional paul trap for ion accumulation and cooling time of flight mass spectrometer and magnetic bottle photoelectron analyzer key feature of the new instrument is the capability to cool and tune ion temperatures from to in the paul trap which is attached to the cold head of closed cycle helium refrigerator ion cooling is accomplished in the paul trap via collisions with background gas and has been demonstrated by observation of complete elimination of vibrational hot bands in photoelectron spectra of various anions ranging from small molecules to complex species further evidence of ion cooling is shown by the observation of physisorbed anions at low temperatures cold anions result in better resolved photoelectron spectra due to the elimination of vibrational hot bands and yield more accurate energetic and spectroscopic information temperature dependent studies are made possible for weakly bonded molecular and solvated clusters allowing thermodynamic information to be obtained many important chemical reactions including all biologically related processes take place in an aqueous solution where the complications of the bulk environments present considerable challenges for obtaining molecular level understanding of phenomena in the solution phase gas phase studies of solution phase species and their microsolvation by controlled solvent numbers allow their intrinsic properties to be obtained and provide ideal molecular models for the condensed phase environments in the late we developed an experimental technique combining electrospray ionization esi and photoelectron spectroscopy pes which was aimed at investigating solution phase species and chemistry in the gas phase using this apparatus we have carried out systematic investigations on variety of subjects related to solution phase species and phenomena including multiply charged anions solvation and solvent stabilization of complex anions inorganic metal complexes and redox species and biorelated systems the combination of esi and pes has proven to be general and powerful technique to probe solution phase species and chemistry in the gas phase however one of the limitations of the apparatus is the lack of ion temperature control because both the ion source and the ion accumulation device are operated at room temperature molecular species particularly complex anions or weakly bonded species can carry substantial internal energies even at room temperature consequently significant thermal broadening can result limiting the spectral resolution and accuracy of the obtained energetic information in addition unique and novel temperature dependent phenomena such as conformation changes for complex anions or isomer distributions for weakly bonded complexes cannot be investigated therefore some types of ion cooling and temperature control would greatly enhance the power of the esi pes technique to probe solution molecules and complex anions the ability to control ion temperatures is critical for gas phase spectroscopy in general and has been real challenge in chemical physics supersonic expansion helium nanodroplet and argon tagging have been used effectively to create cold molecules and ions for gas phase chemical dynamics and spectroscopy studies however precise temperature control and tuning over wide temperature range have been extremely difficult and have not been accomplished recent advances in ion trap technology have made it possible to produce cold ions down to very low temperatures and to allow temperature tuning in principle the basic idea of ion cooling in trap is to use buffer gas as thermal bath at well defined temperature and pressure ions in the trap are confined kinetically by time varying electric field and thermalized both internally and translationally via collisions with the buffer gas here we report the design and construction of variable temperature pes instrument which consists of an esi source cryogenically controlled ion trap time of flight mass spectrometer tofms and magnetic bottle tof photoelectron analyzer the ion temperature control is accomplished using three dimensional paul trap which is attached to the cold head of closed cycle helium refrigerator capable of reaching down to the temperature of the paul trap can be controlled and tuned continuously from to in the next two sections we describe the general considerations and details of the experimental design followed by detailed characterizations of the new instrument in sec iv we demonstrate ion cooling on the basis of elimination of vibrational hot bands in pes spectra and observation of physisorbed complexes weak molecular interactions and entropic effects are studied via temperature dependent pes experiments choice of low temperature thermalization of hot ions by buffer gas has been widely used in mass spectrometry gerlich first demonstrated the feasibility of cooling molecular ions down to very low temperatures few kelvins by thermalization with helium buffer gas in pole ion trap which is attached to cryogenically controlled helium refrigerator the crucial cooling effects achieved in the pole ion trap have been shown in ion molecule reactions cluster associations and very recently infrared spectroscopy higher order radio frequency rf traps such as the pole trap are preferred for ion cooling because of the flatness of the trapping potentials which reduce rf heating however such high order traps only confine ions radially and tend to yield larger trapping volumes both axially and radially while such configurations are quite advantageous for in situ ion molecular reactions or ir spectroscopic studies followed by mass analyses using quadruple mass filter it is rather inefficient in coupling the linear ion traps with low repetition rate tof mass analyzer as dictated by our pes experiments due to difficulties in compressing ions in the axial direction on the other hand d paul trap confines ions both axially and radially like point source and is more suitable for coupling with low repetition rate tofms as demonstrated previously as well as in our previous room temperature esi pes apparatus however the trapping potentials along both axial and radial directions are quadratic in the paul trap and can thus potentially induce rf heating making it unsuitable for ion cooling fortunately it has been shown that when the paul trap is operated at low values it is possible to avoid rf heating indeed parks and co workers demonstrated collisional relaxation and cooling effects of ions in paul trap attached to liquid nitrogen cooled plate additionally the paul trap is commercially available with all the rf power supplies and control electronics for wide mass range simplifying the design and construction consequently we have chosen the paul trap as our ion trapping and cooling device whose temperatures will be controlled by attaching it to the cold head of closed cycle helium refrigerator similar to the gerlich pole ion trapping and cooling device in our previous esi pes apparatus we store all incoming ions from an esi source in d paul trap the design was relatively simple but the trapping efficiency may be reduced especially for weakly populated species due to space charge effects in the ion trap thus it would be desirable to have some kind of pretrapping mass selection the addition of quadruple mass filter between the esi source and the ion trap would accomplish this goal and it would also allow convenient detections of pristine ions coming from the esi source the latter could be very valuable because the process of loading ions into the ion trap may destroy weakly bonded species thus independent knowledge of the pristine ions coming from the esi source would be helpful in tuning the conditions of both the esi source and the ion trap thus in the new low temperature instrument quadruple mass filter has been added which can monitor ions produced from the esi source before the ion trap and can also act as pretrapping mass selector the overall layout and design of the new low temperature esi pes apparatus is shown in fig it consists of an esi quadruple mass spectrometry qms system a cryogenically controlled paul trap coupled to tofms ii and magnetic bottle tof photoelectron analyzer iii key parts of the instruments are numbered in fig and described in detail as follows the electrospray ionization source the esi syringe syringe pump and desolvation capillary are similar to our previous designs in the room temperature instrument ions produced from the desolvation capillary pass through mm diameter skimmer and enter an octopole ion guide after passing through second mm diameter skimmer ions are focused by set of aperture lens into quadruple mass filter the ions are then deflected by ion bender either to channeltron detector to take mass spectra of pristine ions coming from the esi source or to the paul trap through second octopole ion guide and set of focusing lens this second octopole ion guide is critical for transporting weakly bound ions and solvated species into the paul trap bellows is used to house the quadruple mass filter for alignment purposes typical working pressures are torr mtorr and torr in the desolvation capillary ion guide and qms chambers which are differentially pumped by mechanical blower and diffusion pump respectively temperature controlled the heart of the instrument is the temperature controlled paul trap where ions are accumulated and cooled figure shows the detailed design of the low temperature ion trap assembly where key parts are labeled the paul trap m jordan company ca is attached to the cold head second stage of two stage closed cycle helium refrigerator de advanced research system via an extension and an adapter made of oxygen free high purity copper ofhc mm thick sapphire plate with good thermal conductivity is inserted between the ion trap and the ofhc adapter to electrically isolate the ion trap from ground the ion trap is enclosed in gold coated copper cylinder for thermal shielding which is connected to the first stage of the helium refrigerator operated at two cm diameter holes are cut on the copper cylinder for ion entrance and exit from the paul trap the cryostat with the ion trap assembly is mounted on the top of the vacuum chamber via stainless steel bellows system for alignment the lowest ion trap temperature achieved is measured by silicon diode thermal couple which is attached to the ofhc adapter the temperature can be controlled from to via feedback heating system powered by temperature controller model lake shore cryotronics the background gas is precooled to by winding the gas line mm diameter polyether ether ketone peek tubing around the first stage of the cryostat before being fed into the ion trap via mm diameter hole on the alumina spacer in the ion trap assembly the flow rate of the background gas is controlled by needle valve we typically use to mtorr helium with as the collision gas in the ion trap for temperatures below or mtorr gas for temperatures above the background pressure in the ion trap cannot be directly measured but is estimated from the conductance out of the ion trap and the pressure increase in the vacuum chamber in fig housing the ion trap assembly pair of entrance and exit tubing lens and are used to focus incoming ions into the paul trap and refocus them after being ejected out of the trap into the tof extraction stack ions are ejected out of the paul trap at hz repetition rate giving about ms accumulation and cooling time v voltage pulse with variable time width typically ms can be applied to the ion trap entrance aperture lens to stop ion loading for time period before the ions are ejected into the tofms thus ions are trapped and cooled usually for period of ms during which they experience on average about collisions with the background gas time of flight the linear tofms consists of modified wiley mclarren extraction stack similar to our previous design the addition of short free flight zone between the extraction and acceleration stages allows reasonable mass resolution for large extraction volume the ions are ejected from the trap by applying bipolar pulsed voltages on the two end caps on the entrance end cap and on the exit end cap of the paul trap giving an average kinetic energy of ev for the ejected ions kv high voltage pulse is used to perpendicularly extract the ions for tof mass analyses in m long flight tube the ions are focused by two einzel lens and steered by two horizontal and and one vertical deflectors and detected by set of dual microchannel plate mcp detector the whole tofms flight tube is differentially pumped by l diffusion pump for the chamber base pressure of torr l diffusion pump for the chamber base pressure of torr l turbo pump for the six way cross base pressure of torr and l cryopump for the chamber base pressure of torr the working pressures increase by about one order of magnitude to and torr in the b and chambers respectively magnetic bottle photoelectron the magnetic bottle photoelectron analyzer is also similar to our previous design except with longer flight tube for better resolution for fast electrons three grid mass gate and subsequent ten plate deceleration stack are designed to first select an anion of interest and then decelerate it by momentum deceleration to minimize the doppler broadening as described in detail previously nd fe permanent magnet cm diameter cm height machined with tapered angle between and to sharp tip is mounted on translation stage the low magnetic field for the magnetic bottle is generated by solenoid along the long electron flight tube which is also shielded from the earth field by double layer metal cylinder the magnetic field at the tip surface of the permanent magnet is about and reduces to mm away from the tip in the interaction zone the magnet is moved further away from the interaction zone to about cm for high photon energy detachment lasers ev to reduce background electrons from scattered photons two lasers are available for photodetachment nd doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser with all its four harmonics and nm and an excimer laser for nm arf and nm photodetached electrons are collected with nearly efficiency by the magnetic bottle and are guided by the low magnetic field along the long electron flight tube they are detected by fast stack detector consisting of set of three mcps m jordan co ca the and chambers and the electron flight tube can be baked in situ up to by the outside heating tapes to achieve the ultrahigh vacuum base pressures the electrospray solution is loaded into the syringe and kv high voltage is usually applied to the stainless steel needle negatively charged droplets from the syringe are fed into the mm diameter desolvation capillary typically heated to anions produced upon desolvation pass through the first skimmer and the octopole ion guide this skimmer is normally biased at to define the initial ion kinetic energy after passing through the second skimmer the anions are focused into the quadruple mass filter and are normally analyzed first by the channeltron detector after the ion bender this analysis is used to optimize the conditions and alignment of the esi source then all anions are bent toward the paul trap through the second octopole ion guide for accumulation and cooling transistor transistor logic signal which defines the time zero and initiates the experimental cycle triggers off the rf voltage on the ring electrode of the paul trap after s delay the cooled ions are ejected out of the trap by applying and bipolar voltage pulses with duration on the entrance and exit end caps respectively the ejected ions are focused by the exit tube lens in fig into the modified wiley mclarren extraction stack after delay time relative to the bipolar ion ejection pulse kv high voltage pulse is switched on to extract the ions perpendicularly into the long tofms flight tube for m the typical delay time is which is the ion flight time from the paul trap to the center of the wiley mclarren extraction stack the tof for is with kv extraction voltage for given the recorded tof mass spectrum represents only narrow mass range due to the fact that ions with different z ratios will arrive at the wiley mclarren extraction stack at different times the delay time has to be tuned and optimized for different mass ranges the experiment is usually performed at hz repletion rate and the whole experimental cycle and delays are controlled by dg pulse generators from stanford research systems the timing sequence is similar to that described in detail in ref for pes experiments the ion of interest is first selected by the three grid mass gate and then decelerated by the momentum decelerator details of the mass gate and momentum deceleration have been described previously detachment laser beam intercepts the decelerated anions in front of the tip of the permanent magnet in the interaction zone the detachment laser is operated at hz repetition rate with the ion beam off on alternate shots for background subtraction the photodetached electrons are collected with nearly efficiency by the magnetic bottle and analyzed in the long electron flight tube photoelectron tof spectra are collected and then converted to kinetic energy spectra calibrated by the known spectra of oscl or clo the electron binding energy spectra are obtained by subtracting the kinetic energy spectra from the detachment photon energy used performance of the low temperature the initial construction of the low temperature instrument was finished in late since then cold pes spectra of variety of anions have been obtained and reported while we were debugging and making further improvements to this fairly complex instrument the effects of temperature on the quality of the obtained pes data are dramatic moreover temperature dependent studies have been made possible allowing observations of conformation changes of complex anions as function of temperature the time of flight mass spectrometer and figure shows the tof mass spectra of solvated sulfate dianions at three different temperatures by spraying mm solution of nbu so in h ch cn mixed solvent volume ratio the best resolution achieved for the tofms is m the background gas used in the paul trap is mtorr helium with the mass spectrum at is similar to that at room temperature besides the strong hso and hso o signals the solvated sulfate clusters so o n are the dominated anions the weaker peaks in between are due to mixed solvent clusters so o ch cn however at trapping temperature numerous additional peaks separated by z are observed these additional peaks turned out to be due to condensation of onto the cold anions e physisorbed clusters at more extensive condensation is observed the adducts disappear at trapping temperatures above even though the absolute temperatures of the anions cannot be directly measured the observation of condensation and its temperature dependence suggests that the internal temperatures of the trapped ions should be in close thermal equilibrium with the wall of the ion trap magnetic bottle photoelectron the performance of the new magnetic bottle photoelectron spectrometer is similar to that of the previous room temperature instrument except that the longer electron flight tube yields better resolution for fast electrons figure shows the pes spectra of at three photon energies and nm where the peak width and the corresponding photoelectron kinetic energies are given the spectral resolution measured as full width at half maximum fwhm exhibits strong dependence on the electron kinetic energies compared to the same spectra taken with our previous room temperature esi pes apparatus the resolution for fast electrons are indeed improved considerably for example the peak at nm defines spectral resolution of mev fwhm for ev electrons e e relative to mev from the previous apparatus however for very low energy electrons the resolution is slightly inferior in the new instrument this is probably due to the fact that low energy electrons are more sensitive to local field inhomogeneity that may result from the longer flight tube for electrons with ev kinetic energies the resolution of the new instrument e is comparable to the previous instrument the improvement of fast electrons is important for the study of multiply charged anions for which high energy electrons often result because of the repulsive coulomb barrier low temperature photoelectron spectroscopy one major motivation to conduct pes on cold anions is to eliminate vibrational hot bands that cause spectral congestions supersonic expansion has been used effectively for cooling neutral molecules for spectroscopic studies but it is more challenging for ionic species we demonstrate vibrational cooling in the paul trap using two examples one simple anion clo and one large anion as shown in figs and respectively we have used these anions as testing cases to tune cooling conditions such as the background gas pressure and ion trap operation conditions we have found that molecular gases such as and are more effective for vibrational cooling in our ion trap than pure rare gases most likely due to more effective collisional vibrational to vibrational energy transfers for rigid molecules like clo and there are no low frequency vibrational modes in these cases we find that hot vibrational bands can be eliminated at operating temperatures of or even higher for which we can simply use as the background gas for experiments at temperatures lower than we usually use helium with as the cooling gas the spectra of both clo and were obtained using mtorr as the background gas in the case of clo the room temperature spectrum is considerably broadened due to vibrational excitations in the anions as shown in previous high resolution study by gilles et al the main vibrational progression in the clo spectrum is due to the cl symmetric stretching mode at the hot band is completely eliminated resulting in much better resolved spectrum under the same electron energy resolution in particular the bending mode weak peaks in between the intense stretching vibrational peaks can be clearly resolved at even though the spectral resolution is not very high in the current magnetic bottle instrument the spectral information in the low temperature data of clo is similar to that obtained in the high resolution spectrum by gilles et al is large anion and it carries about ev internal energy at room temperature as revealed in the long tail in the low binding energy side in the room temperature spectrum such large molecule would have been difficult to be cooled internally even in an intense supersonic expansion as shown in fig the vibrational hot bands are completely eliminated at for demonstrating the effectiveness of vibrationally cooling in the paul trap temperature dependent photoelectron spectroscopy probing conformation changes as function of one of the major advantages of using the closed cycle helium refrigerator is the ability to control ion temperatures over wide temperature range using feedback heating system this capability allows temperature dependent studies to probe conformation changes and entropic effects in complex anions as function of temperature the monocarboxylate anions ch ch nco were one of the first systems that we studied at low temperatures significant spectral sharpening and reduction of vibrational hot bands were observed in the low temperature spectra for the shorter chain species of however for those species with we observed surprisingly systematic spectral shift to higher binding energies at low temperatures relative to spectra taken at room temperature the blueshift turned out to be due to linear to cyclic conformation change at low temperatures where the negative charge on the carboxylate forms weak h hydrogen bond with the terminal ch group because of the weak strength anticipated for the h hydrogen bonding the folded conformation can only be observed at low temperatures due to the large entropic contributions for the linear structure at higher temperatures figure displays set of spectra for ch ch co from room temperature down to it was observed that the conformation change occurs between and below which all the anions become cyclic and no significant changes were observed at lower temperatures we have recently carried out an extensive temperature dependent pes study on hydrated suberate dianions c ch co o x and probed their structural changes as function of temperature and degree of hydration our previous room temperature study shows that o solvates the two negative charges in the linear suberate dianion separately and alternatively however water mediated folding transition was observed at in which the two separate solvation centers merge due to enhanced water water bonding interactions our recent low temperature study shows that the folding transition occurs at fewer solvent molecules at low temperatures again due to the entropic effects that favor the linear conformation at higher temperatures detailed temperature dependent studies also revealed folding barrier and allowed energetic and thermal dynamic information to be obtained between the linear and folded conformations in conclusion second generation electrospray pes instrument with temperature control capability has been developed to investigate complex anions and solution phase species in the gas phase the critical part of the new instrument is cryogenically controlled paul trap used to accumulate and cool anions from an electrospray ion source the temperatures of trapped ions are controlled via collisions with background gas the paul trap is connected to closed cycle helium refrigerator which can be operated from to temperatures as low as has been achieved at the ion trap and can be tuned through feedback heating system from to cold ions have been demonstrated by the observation of condensation vibrational cooling from both simple and complex anions has been observed yielding considerably better resolved photoelectron spectra temperature dependent photoelectron spectroscopic studies have revealed conformation changes as function of temperature and have yielded both energetic and thermodynamic information for complex anions cooling and temperature tuning of ionic species have been very challenging in ion spectroscopy the current use of d paul trap is relatively simple design and may find wide applications in ion spectroscopy the observation of physisorbed complexes provides new research opportunities to probe the interactions of with ionic species the complexes can also be conveniently used for action spectroscopy of complex anions the temperature controlled ion trap technique may play the same role for creating cold ions as the supersonic beam technique for creating cold neutral molecules the temperature tunability of the cryogenic ion trap technique is powerful and will be important for distinguishing isomers of weakly bonded species as well as allowing temperature dependent conformation changes to be examined for complex anions and biological molecules  the very old and successful density functional technique of half occupation is revisited c slater adv quant chem we use it together with the modern exchange correlation approximations to calculate atomic ionization energies and band gaps in semiconductors g ferreira et al phys rev here we enlarge the results of the previous paper add to its understandability and show when the technique might fail even in this latter circumstance the calculated band gaps are far better than those of simple lda or gga as before the difference between the kohn sham ground state one particle eigenvalues and the half occupation eigenvalues is simply interpreted as the self energy not self interaction of the particle excitation in both cases that of atomic ionization energies and semiconductor band gaps the technique is proven to be very worthy because not only the results can be very precise but the calculations are fast and very simple the very old half occupation technique and its formalization through the janak theorem have been continuously used since the seventies even now we find many papers citing those authors and using their techniques in many computational problems the janak theorem refers to the derivative of the total energy with respect to the occupation which equals the kohn sham ks eigenvalue if the derivative is linear with the occupation then the half occupation technique follows part of the recurring publications on the subject refers to verifying the linearity and this since the early days of the technique the first applications of the half occupation technique were for atoms thus we revisit this problem now using the modern exchange correlation approximations in this respect our work runs parallel to that of kraisler et al among others though they did not use the half occupation technique which is matter of necessity in our case as we will see in the case of extended systems crystals after atoms molecules and clusters the half occupation technique must face the problem of extended systems such as crystals in this respect aside from our work being reviewed we only know the work of liberman of course removing electron from an infinite system is no perturbation so that special handling of the half occupation technique is required related to this special technique is the definition of self energy or the self interaction known to be missing in the kohn sham eigenvalues the self interaction correction sic also has long history it was first defined by perdew and zunger and frequently proposed as the difference between the ionization energy ie and the ks eigenvalue it happens that whenever the janak theorem is valid namely when the energy functional can be differentiated with respect to the occupations one can prove that the difference between the ie and the ks eigenvalue is about the sic defined by ref this factor of apparently first discovered by trickey has also been numerically verified by refs to avoid confusion we are naming the difference between the ie and the ks eigenvalue following from janak theorem as self energy because its expression is indeed that of self energy the technique was proposed by slater group in the early seventies at that time the density functional df approximations were unknown and researchers were using the exchange to obtain the best results available at the time the half ion technique gained its formalization much latter with janak which proved documentclass pt minimal

self energy tends to be independent of the occupations now inserting eq into eq obtain documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation e alpha alpha end equation end document e s meaning that the ionization of electron requires not only the negative of the eigenvalue energy but the self energy as well we calculated many ionization energies ie with the half occupation technique using both the lda approximation of perdew and zunger to the results of ceperley and alder and the gga of perdew burke and ernzerhof our calculations were all with spin polarization thus for the heavier atoms we had to make perturbation correction to include relativistic effects our results are compared with experiment and with calculated results by other methods the nist site presents very large tables of ie data of course we cannot compare our results with coupled clusters coupled cluster is known to reach precision of sub mev but only for very light atoms for heavier atoms their precision is not better than ours we are mainly interested in extended systems specially in semiconductors where heavier atoms are important thus we are comparing our results calculated with spin polarization radial grid integration lda and gga half ion technique with basis functions results hartree fock hf and density functional df results presented in the nist site in the nist site we chose the results for the largest basis aug cc pvqz when available and for the honorable lyp functional the comparison is in fig as expected only hf has important deviations from experimental values the results presented in ref also seem to coincide with ours and nist barring hf though detailed comparison is not possible because those authors do not tabulate their results ref also obtains the ionization energies as the difference between the total energies of atom and ion not from half occupation looking more closely at the rms of the difference between calculated and experimental values our gga calculation is outstanding its superiority with respect to lda only proves that in searching for better exchange correlation approximations scientists have not been idle the apparent superiority of gga with respect to lyp might be problem of method numerical against bases not necessarily question of quality of the approximation one important advantage of the half ion technique is its ability to calculate heavier atoms and higher order ie to show this ability we plot in fig the first and second ie for the atoms tabulated in reference and some heavier atoms in the calculation of the second ie one must delete electrons from the atom the inclusion of the heavier atoms increased the rms error to some extent the second ie has higher rms error than the first in the case of cs and tl we had to apply perturbation scheme to include the relativistic corrections into the spin polarized calculation following eq the ie which equals minus the eigenvalue at half occupation is obtained if we subtract the self energy from the eigenvalue at full occupation the self energy is the quantum mechanical average documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation alpha int r alpha vec v vec end equation end

energy potential from the potential of the atom and run single non self consistent iteration to determine the eigenvalue at half occupation after the subtraction the potential is r no longer r and the eigenvalue of single iteration is this seems an undue complication in the case of atoms but it is important in the case of many atom systems in those cases we will want to use the self energy potential defined in the atom and subtract it from the potentials of the atoms of the same species composing the system extended systems band gaps first we recall that the ks eigenstates in crystal are bloch states whose wavefunctions extend through the infinite crystal as such the bloch state has an exactly null self energy now when removing or exciting an electron from an occupied band say the topmost valence band the excitation or hole does behave as being in localized wavefunction therefore with non null self energy in fact it would be impossible to remove an electron infinitely delocalized in any finite time further theories of excitons potential barriers etc would be in trouble if holes were bloch states though these arguments seem to be very simple there is no calculation of localized hole in solid that we know of specially in the case when such localized hole could scatter into the continuum of band states or in other words when the localized hole is degenerate with the band continuum thus to proceed with the half occupation for crystals we have to assume that holes in valence band and electrons in conduction band are localized with non null self energy generalizing eqs and to describe the excitation of an electron from the valence to the conduction band we write documentclass pt minimal begin document begin eqnarray text true band gap excited val cond ground c v nonumber c v c v nonumber text kohn sham band gap v c end eqnarray end document truebandgap eexcited val cond eground ec ev ec ev sc sv kohn shambandgap sv sc this last equation is frequently writen as documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation text true band gap text kohn sham band gap delta xc nonumber end equation end document truebandgap kohn shambandgap xcwhere xc is known as the derivative discontinuity that is caused by an exchange correlation beyond lda or gga the half occupation technique allows an entirely different and perhaps simpler interpretation of this discontinuity it is self energy caused by the localization of the particle excitation and it is not the effect of exotic exchange correlation functionals since we do not know how to calculate localized holes and electrons in solids which are not even stationary states we assume that their self energies are again quantum mechanical averages of the atomic self energy potential vs in crystal such as nacl we would add vs cl to the chlorine atoms and vs na to the sodiums we add to all atoms of the crystal because the calculation with just one or few perturbed atoms is much too complicate there is problem with adding vs to all the atoms of an infinite crystal the potential will diverge vs is potential of an excess charge of proton see eq and has tail of that cannot be summed in an infinite lattice therefore the tail has to be trimmed by step function and we have been using documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation theta left lbrace begin array lr left big frac cut big right le cut cut end array right end equation end document rcutm cut cut thus we are making documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation s longrightarrow s prime theta v r end equation end document vs vs r vs in this eq the exponent is as large as possible and it is limited only by the band calculation code we have been using always thus we are introducing single parameter in the calculation cut which is determined variationally as explained in ref thus our recipe named lda to determine band gaps consists of adding the atomic self energy potential to the atoms of the crystal now in all our calculations with crystals and we made many we never found an instance when the self energy of the electron in the conduction band had any importance in eq the valence band is usually made of the valence state of the anion while the conduction band is usually mixture of many atomic states there included the valence state of the cation then usually the self energy of the cation could be neglected or which is the same the extremizing solution usually was cutcation in this respect we found the calculation of the work functions of al cu na very symptomatic work function is band gap between the fermi level at the conduction band and the free electron band at infinity in those cases we always found cut that is the lda method reducing to standard lda fig shows the situation of the exceptional case zno this material is exceptional in two ways first the pure lda or gga calculations give band gap smaller than ev while our lda is able to bring the gap to value close to the experimental ev major shift and major success of our technique secondly it is exceptional because the self energy of the cation zn cannot be neglected fig explains how the calculation was made we began by including the self energy potential for the anion documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation s r s r s r end equation end document vso v p v p and by maximizing the gap with respect to cuto then with the maximizing cuto fixed we included the self energy potential for zn documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation s zn v s v s end equation end document vszn v s v s a new maximization was made resulting in gap near the experimental value we have been naming our method of calculating band gaps as the lda though sometimes we use the generalized gradient approximation for instance of ref instead of the local density approximation of refs or the nscf version is that explained in the last paragraph of section iii in other words the model number density is chosen that of the ground state unperturbed by vs for single interaction we choose the potential as the sum of the ground state potential plus the cut trimmed self energy potential solve the schroedinger equation then cut is chosen so as to make the band gap extreme the procedure works very well for highly ionic crystals as shown in fig there we compare calculated band gaps with measured numbers the pink balls are calculations according to the present procedure they fall very near the straight line of perfection simple lda without any correction gives band gaps smaller as shown by the blue crosses then using the procedure of the next subsection that is the scf lda we obtain the red squares that are half way between the pure lda results and the nscf lda results this is the original lda method the atomic self energy potential trimmed by the function eq is added to the atoms of the crystal as an external potential then self consistent iterations are run the parameter cut is chosen according to make the gap extreme since the paper many new semiconductors were calculated the new plot of calculated band gaps versus experimental band gaps fig is very impressive probably the best set of calculated band gaps available in the literature it is very difficult to calculate the self energy in the crystal itself and we have been recurring to atomic physics to calculate an approximation we found that for most semiconductors the self energy potential of the atom was transferable to crystals after trimming its tail for the highly ionic crystal we found that no self consistent loops could be made for the crystals in the fig we are finding that neither procedure self consistent or non self consistent is very good in the case of these oxides we found that working procedure was to calculate the self energy potential of oxygen as documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation o v r s end equation end document o v r vs instead of eq for the neutral atoms we are paying price for using an atomic self energy potential instead of self energy potential defined in the crystal we do not know priori whether to run self consistent iterations or nscf on the other hand it is easy to verify that all covalent semiconductors and insulators require full scf calculations while the highly ionic insulators require treating the self energy potential in single nscf iteration further the localized valence band hole energy ev sv falls within the band continuum for those cases when we make the standard scf lda and falls outside for the cases when we use nscf thus there is simple explanation for the difference between the two procedures when the hole energy falls within the band continuum the atomic self energy potential is screened by the other band electrons and the self consistent iterations must be completed to account for that screening contrarily when the hole energy falls outside the band no screening by the electrons of the other atoms must be considered and the situation is all similar to that of atoms in this paper we show the power of slater half ion technique transition state technique aside from its known usefulness to finite systems such as atoms molecules and cluster we now extend its use to crystals and semiconductors the extension is attained by taking second derivative of the energy functional one step beyond janak first derivative which allowed us to define self energy means to calculate ionization energies and band gaps the set of band gaps we are presenting have gw precision though it is obtained with minimal computational effort this paper resulted from our experience with the half occupation technique after its proposal in ref in the case of atoms we compared our ionization energies with those of other methods and verified that we are performing better except for the coupled cluster results of the first line of the periodic table in the case of crystals we now included highly ionic insulators for which our technique had to be modified we are also presenting band gap results for many new covalent semiconductors and to be complete we found some solids oxides for which the technique did not perform very well  zinc oxide is promising material for blue and uv solid state lighting devices among other applications nitrogen has been regarded as potential type dopant for zno however recent calculations lyons janotti and van de walle appl phys lett indicate that nitrogen is deep acceptor this paper presents experimental evidence that nitrogen is in fact deep acceptor and therefore cannot produce type zno broad photoluminescence pl emission band near ev with an excitation onset of ev was observed in agreement with the deep acceptor model of the nitrogen defect the deep acceptor behavior can be explained by the low energy of the zno valence band relative to the vacuum level zinc oxide direct gap semiconductor with wide band gap of ev is considered promising material for variety of electronic and optoelectronic applications including blue and uv solid state lighting devices suitable type dopant is however an outstanding issue for realizing its potential for practical device applications substitutional nitrogen no has been discussed as an acceptor dopant experiments and some theoretical investigations suggest no to produce shallow acceptor in zno with an estimated hole ionization energy of mev as reviewed in ref the scientific literature is full of reports that nitrogen doping can produce type zno lyons janotti and van de walle revisited the properties of nitrogen in zno following first principles computation using hybrid functionals their calculations show that no is deep acceptor with the acceptor level ev above the valence band maximum optical absorption and emission energies of ev and ev respectively were estimated from configuration coordinate diagram analysis the franck condon shift of ev is due to large lattice relaxation of the deep acceptor these theoretical results suggest that the reports of type doping need to be reexamined in this paper we present an experimental investigation of bulk doped zno samples photoluminescence pl measurements were carried out at room temperature using jy horiba fluorolog spectrofluorometer equipped with double grating excitation and emission monochomators grooves mm resolution nm and an p photomultiplier tube pmt the excitation source was w xenon cw lamp an instrumental correction was performed on all pl spectra to correct for the wavelength dependent pmt response grating efficiencies and the variation in output intensity from the lamp infrared ir absorption spectra of nitrogen related complexes were obtained with bomem da vacuum fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer equipped with globar light source kbr beamsplitter and liquid nitrogen cooled indium antimonide insb detector janis closed cycle helium cryostat system was used to maintain the samples at low temperatures bulk single crystal samples were grown via seeded chemical vapor transport method in an ammonia ambient which provided the nitrogen as well as hydrogen dopants an ir absorption peak at cm at room temperature cm at was observed this peak has been unambiguously assigned to n complex thermal anneals were carried out in an evacuated silica ampoule filled with atm oxygen before sealing annealing at oc drives out hydrogen donors while the h bond remains intact to activate nitrogen acceptors the sample was annealed at oc causing the h pairs to dissociate leading to reduction in the h absorption peak intensity fig the decrease in free carrier absorption after the oc anneal indicates that the nitrogen acceptors compensate fraction of the donors this decrease in type conductivity was previously observed by hall effect measurements on similarly grown samples annealed in oxygen figure shows pl emission spectra at an excitation wavelength of nm ev for the sample annealed in at oc and subsequently at oc broad red emission band is detected at nm ev in good agreement with the deep acceptor model to further increase the concentration of acceptors the sample was subsequently annealed at oc for the sample shows decrease in h peak intensity and corresponding increase in the red emission band fig the photoluminescence excitation ple spectrum fig was obtained by monitoring the red emission band at nm as function of excitation wavelength an excitation onset of ev was observed consistent with the configuration coordinate diagram for optical transitions based on the deep acceptor model fig inset the main features of the ple spectrum an excitation onset followed by monotonic increase with photon energy are similar to ple spectra observed for deep native acceptors in znse the ple spectrum concurs with the observed optical transmission spectrum of the sample not shown absorption of photon energies ev gives the sample reddish appearance similar absorption profile has been correlated with nitrogen acceptors detected by electron paramagnetic resonance infrared absorption spectra were obtained at while the sample was exposed to nm ev laser light an increase in free carrier absorption was observed fig this provides additional evidence of deep level since photon energy of ev cannot cause transition of an electron from shallow acceptor level to the conduction band in zno which has band gap of ev the photoconductivity persists for several hours when the sample is left in the dark the observation of free carrier absorption is consistent with the optical excitation of an electron from the no deep acceptor to the conduction band the persistence of the free carriers following illumination is consistent with large lattice relaxation of deep level impurity to further test the deep acceptor model an doped sample was annealed in hydrogen at oc an increase in free carrier density and h peak intensity was observed after the hydrogen anneal indicating passivation of acceptors by hydrogen the pl emission shows dramatic disappearance of the red emission band after the hydrogen anneal fig manifestly consistent with hydrogen passivation of deep acceptors native defects are often invoked to account for the observed optical and electrical properties of zno to verify that the red emission that we observe and associate with acceptors is neither due to oxygen vacancies nor zinc vacancies nominally undoped single crystal zno samples from cermet inc were annealed in zinc vapor and oxygen respectively the zinc annealed sample turned red in agreement with prior work that attributed the red color to oxygen vacancies while the oxygen annealed sample did not show any color change neither of the samples exhibits the red pl emission band figs and when excited by above band gap light the cermet samples and our doped samples all exhibit the well known green luminescence band centered at ev the green pl emission increased upon annealing in zinc or oxygen vapor green luminescence has been attributed to various defects including the zinc vacancy oxygen vacancy and copper impurity the observation that red luminescence occurs only in doped samples provides additional support for our assignment the deep acceptor behavior of nitrogen in zno appears to be at odds with results in other ii vi semiconductors in znte znse and zns nitrogen is shallow acceptor and can be used to obtain low resistivity type material the fundamental difference between zno and these other materials can be seen by examining the positions of their valence band maxima relative to the vacuum level figure shows such band alignment diagram where the nitrogen acceptor level is assumed to have constant absolute energy in zno the level is ev above the valence band maximum making nitrogen deep acceptor for the other ii vi semiconductors shown in fig the level lies in the valence band in those cases the nitrogen atom is negatively charged and weakly binds hole e it acts as shallow acceptor in summary doped zno samples exhibit broad red pl emission band peaking near ev with an excitation onset of ev in good agreement with the deep acceptor model for the nitrogen impurity the intensity of this red emission band increases with the concentration of activated nitrogen acceptors observation of an increase in free carrier concentration when the sample is exposed to nm ev light provides further evidence for nitrogen related deep acceptor level the deep acceptor behavior of nitrogen can be explained by the low position of the zno valence band relative to vacuum this intrinsic feature of zno could prove daunting challenge to its type doping alloying with chalcogens se or te may provide possible future route to raising the valence band to realize reduced nitrogen acceptor binding energy and hence open the door to doping  cell isolation in designated regions or from heterogeneous samples is often required for many microfluidic cell based assays however current techniques have either limited throughput or are incapable of viable off chip collection we present an innovative approach allowing high throughput and label free cell isolation and enrichment from heterogeneous solution using cell size as biomarker the approach utilizes the irreversible migration of particles into microscale vortices developed in parallel expansion contraction trapping reservoirs as the cell isolation mechanism we empirically determined the critical particle cell diameter dcrt and the operational flow rate above which trapping of cells particles in microvortices is initiated using this approach we successfully separated larger cancer cells spiked in blood from the smaller blood cells with processing rates as high as cells viable long term culture was established using cells collected off chip suggesting that the proposed technique would be useful for clinical and research applications in which in vitro culture is often desired the presented technology improves on current technology by enriching cells based on size without clogging mechanical filters employing only simple single layered microfluidic device and processing cell solutions at the ml min scale selective target cell isolation based on intrinsic biomarkers such as size deformability and polarizability allows for cost effective detection and purification of viable cells with unknown molecular biomarkers and without immunolabeling moreover high purity collection of intact rare cells with preserved gene expression will facilitate molecular assays for such cells potentially useful for cell biology research immunology tissue engineering and medicine in the field of the tissue engineering for instance there is intense interest in purification of specific cell populations for high quality tissue graft construction but the limited knowledge of the specific surface markers required for discrimination of such cells remains challenge more generally immunostaining and transgenic enrichment techniques are not desired for some research and clinical applications which require to collect viable cells with preserved gene expression profiles additionally techniques capable of isolating rare cells in peripheral blood such as fetal cells endothelial progenitor cells and circulating tumor cells ctc in label free manner with high throughput will have an immediate impact for diagnostic and prognostic applications therefore systems that allow cost effective label free and high throughput target cell enrichment will have significant impact on both clinical and research applications recently there have been several efforts to develop microfluidic platforms for label free separation of target cells utilizing intrinsic physical and electrical biomarkers the most widely adopted physical biomarker is cell size many microfluidic techniques for continuous size based enrichment including membrane microfiltration pinched flow fractionation deterministic lateral displacement and hydrophoresis have been demonstrated for numerous potential applications applications include the fractionation of whole blood cardiomyocyte enrichment for cardiac graft construction size based cell cycle synchrony as well as ctc separation from blood these approaches have been shown to be successful in prototype systems however in many cases the throughput required for commercial applications would require parallelization or in the case of filtration approaches samples are not easily moved or handled after separation recent work in inertial focusing offers rapid size based separation at the ml min scale but lacks the ability to significantly concentrate the target population into smaller volume after operation trapping of particles by size in laminar vortices may address these previous shortcomings the presence of laminar vortices resulting from inertially driven separation of the laminar boundary layer at sharp corners has been observed in previous computational and theoretical studies mesoscale laminar vortices have been extensively studied to understand the aggregation of red blood cells rbcs and platelets within vortex and particle motion in recirculation zone has been presented in alveolar flow interaction of particles and vortices at the microscale has been further investigated by observing pattern formation of recirculating colloidal particles by lim et al similar pattern formation and effects of vortices on motility were reported for swimming micro organisms sequestered in vortices formed in microfluidic devices microscale laminar vortices were also utilized to broaden cell particle free layers useful for high purity plasma extraction or to enhance the lateral displacement of ordered particle streams based on size however for particulate samples in microfluidic systems it has been considered difficult to achieve initial trapping of relatively large bioparticles in the vortices without the aid of external forces recently work by khabiry et al has investigated target cell migration and immobilization into microscale vortices but in this case entry into the vortices was due to gravitational force accordingly this method separates on combination of both cell density and size and requires slow enough flow rate such that gravitational effects are significant here we present passive continuous microfluidic device that isolates larger target cells into the microscale vortices from heterogeneous suspension with high throughput cells by instead exploiting differences in shear gradient induced lift forces using an array of expansion contraction channels first we systematically varied the flow rate to determine when the microscale vortex formation is initiated and stabilized then the critical diameter required for trapping particle cells in vortices was identified using particle cells with various diameters furthermore as proof of concept toward the enrichment of larger cancer cells from smaller blood cells cultured cancer cells spiked in dilute blood sample prior to the injection were separated and enriched using our approach viability of the collected cells was monitored in order to determine whether the proposed fluidic process adversely affects processed cells utilizing unique microscale fluid dynamics the presented technique provides simple and practical size based cell enrichment approach for variety of applications in this study we utilized microscale laminar vortices combined with inertial focusing to selectively isolate and trap larger cells of interest g cancer cells while smaller cells g erythrocytes and leukocytes are flushed out of the device multiple microscale laminar vortices e moffatt corner eddy flow were created by flowing the particle laden fluid sample at sufficiently high channel reynolds number rc umdh through channel consisting of an array of expansion contraction reservoirs placed in series and parallel figs and here um and are the density maximum velocity and dynamic viscosity of the fluid respectively while dh is the hydraulic diameter of the channel defined as dh wch wc where wc and are the width and height of straight focusing channel respectively upstream of the vortices particles migrate to distinct vertical and lateral equilibrium positions resulting from balance between two counteracting inertial lift forces namely shear gradient lift fls and wall effect lift flw ref see fig previous work suggests that the shear gradient lift force scales as fls fl um wc acting on particles and leading to migration toward the channel walls whereas the wall effect lift force scaling as flw fl um wc repels the particles away from the wall here fl and wc are the dimensionless lift coefficient the particle diameter and the channel width e shorter face of the rectangular channel respectively by using straight channel with rectangular cross section the dynamic equilibrium positions of the flowing particles cells can be precisely controlled to be in the proximity of the channel walls at uniform height for finite rc as the entrained particles enter reservoir where the neighboring wall is no longer in close proximity the particles are exposed only to shear gradient lift fls in the direction toward the vortex center since the shear gradient lift force scales with larger particles experience larger lateral lift force this force is assumed to be balanced by stokes drag fd avt thus the lateral migration velocity vt will scale with and be independent of the particle mass size dependent lateral migration drives particles across streamlines past the detached boundary separatrix toward the vortex core where they remain isolated and orbiting in the vortex this leads to the possibility of size selective trapping as below particle size cutoff particles do not migrate at sufficient rate to pass the separatrix and remain in focused streams flowing out of the device the high flow rate required for vortex generation assists in this process as theoretical analysis has showed that the lateral equilibrium position of focused particles shifts toward the wall as rc increases bringing the focused streams of flowing particles cells closer to the separatrix at the reservoir and possibly enhance the capturing efficiency device to determine the device operational parameters such as flow rate and critical diameter for trapping we implemented single straight high aspect ratio channel wc h and cm consisting of one inlet with coarse filters two reservoirs wr wr and one outlet the high aspect ratio straight channel was implemented so that flowing particle cells were inertially focused to two distinct lateral focusing positions closer to channel walls at uniform plane prior to entering the cell trapping reservoir region for label free target cell isolation we designed microfluidic chip with two inlets eight parallel straight channels with aforementioned dimensions and one outlet the simplicity of the device single rectangular channel with reservoirs allowed the system to be easily parallelized in order to enhance the throughput fig moreover simple two inlet system allowed for easy and rapid solution exchange within the device providing means to flush untrapped contaminating smaller blood cells and to enhance the final enrichment ratio and the purity of the collected samples the reservoirs were placed in an alternating pattern in order to place the maximum number of reservoirs in given compact footprint the microfluidic devices were fabricated with conventional soft lithography techniques using polydimethylsiloxane pdms in brief for mold fabrication silicon wafer was spin coated with m thick layer of negative photoresist kmpr microchem exposed to uv light through designed cr photomask and developed pdms sylgard dow corning was cast on to the prepared mold and degassed cured pdms cast was separated from the mold and the inlet and outlet were punched with pin vise pin vise set technical innovations inc the punched pdms chip was bonded to slide glass by exposing both pdms and slide glass surfaces to air plasma plasma cleaner harrick plasma to enclose the microfluidic chips particle and cell suspension internally dyed fluorescent polystyrene microspheres were purchased from duke scientific samples with particles whose diameters are

and mcf cells breast carcinoma cell line were cultured in the growth media suggested by american type culture collection atcc and incubated at in co until near confluence the concentration and the size distribution of cell suspensions were measured using coulter counter tm coulter counter beckman coulter various concentrations of fluorescently stained live hela cells calcein am were loaded into the device with reservoirs placed in parallel and series to evaluate the capturing efficiency and viability of captured and released cells for spiking experiments cancer cells hela and mcf were fluorescently labeled with celltracker blue cmac invitrogen prior to preparing the cell mixture whereas leukocytes were labeled with anti cd fitc invitrogen whole blood samples were drawn from healthy volunteers into venous blood collection tubes bd vacutainer containing ml of trisodium citrate l citric acid l and dextrose l and leukocytes were obtained by selectively lysing erythrocytes using rbc lysis buffer ebioscience although cancer cells spiked in diluted whole blood can also be separated using microscale vortices rbc lysed blood was used in order to achieve practical throughput of cancer cell isolation blood and cancer cells were mixed to achieve final ratio of cancer cells to leukocytes cancer cell concentration used in this study was chosen to be relatively higher than the actual number counts reported for ctcs in clinical samples g ml of whole blood for visualization and enumeration purposes these experiments were performed with the total number concentration of cells ml and ml of the cell solution was processed in each experiment fluorescence and high speed microscopic microparticle cell containing samples were injected into the device with syringe pump harvard apparatus phd to sustain an overall flow rate ranging between min and ml min the solution in plastic syringe was continuously agitated during injection in order to maintain uniform concentration throughout the experiment the loaded syringe was connected to in peek tubing upchurch scientific by in luer stub instech solomon and tubing was secured in the punched inlet and outlet of the microfluidic device fluorescent images were recorded using nikon eclipse ti microscope equipped with photometrics coolsnap hq charge coupled device ccd camera and analyzed with nikon nis elements ar software exposure time was varied from to according to the flow rate and observed fluorescence intensities three dimensional vortex formation was visualized using nikon confocal microscope high speed microscopic images of trapping and releasing particle cells were recorded downstream using phantom high speed camera and phantom camera control vision research inc and phantom camera control software all high speed images were taken using exposure time and image intervals were varied according to the flow rate capturing efficiency and enrichment of larger cells various concentrations of fluorescently stained live hela cells as well as cancer cells spiked in dilute blood were loaded into the parallel microfluidic channel to evaluate the capturing efficiency as function of cell concentrations prior to injection of the cell solutions formation of microvortices at each reservoir was initiated and stabilized by flowing the flushing solution e growth media without cellular components at qflush ml min for vortex priming step the solution containing known number of cells qcell ml min and flushing solution qflush ml min were simultaneously injected through two separate inlets at the overall flow rate qcell qflush ml min to trap cancer cells in the reservoir capturing step once known amount of the cell solution was injected or ml the cell solution was stopped qcell while the overall flow rate was maintained at ml min by increasing the flow rate of the flushing solution qflush in order to remove uncaptured cells from the device flushing step finally trapped cells were released from the reservoir by lowering qflush to min until all captured cells escaped from reservoirs followed by s final flush qflush ml min to ensure complete collection of cells released from the reservoir yet remaining in the tube releasing step here qcell and qflush were empirically optimized in order to ensure that the cell solution flows through all eight parallel channels during the capturing step while backflow of the cell solution into the flushing inlet is prevented furthermore during the vortex priming flush and releasing steps the flow of the cell solution through the sample inlet was physically stopped using stopcock to prevent the additional introduction of unwanted contaminating cells processed sample solutions at each step were collected separately in individual wells of well plate to determine the capturing efficiency cancer captured cancer inlet by counting stained cells in fluorescence images taken over the entire well released cells collected in the well plate were cultured over week in conventional co incubator to determine the viability of processed cancer cells furthermore mixed cell suspension of cancer cells spiked in dilute blood with or without lysed rbcs cell solution was flowed through the parallel microfluidic channel in order to isolate and enrich the larger cancer cells from the mixture following the same sample injection sequence the enrichment ratio was determined as er cancer leukocytes outlet cancer leukocytes inlet using the number ratio between cancer and blood cells in collected samples and in the initial sample obtained by counting stained cells in fluorescence images taken at random locations flow visualization vortex structure and symmetry were found to be strongly dependent on flow speed figure illustrates the two dimensional view of the evolution of the flow pattern within the reservoir obtained using dilute fluorescent tracer particles m the detachment of the boundary layer was observed to be initiated at rc and the size of the vortex gradually increased with increasing flow rate moreover it was found that the vortex core was progressively shifted toward the center of the reservoir and the microscale vortex finally occupied the entire reservoir at rc and remained stable for higher rc interestingly confocal microscopic images of fluorescent particle streaks revealed that the orbiting ring created by these trapped particles is located in between planes occupied by inertially focused particles in the straight region figs and the ring occupies region between the center and wall in the channel cross section but further from the wall than the inertial focusing positions in the main channel notably more than one vortex ring was observed to be formed in single reservoir suggesting multiple stable orbits that can be occupied by captured particles cells the fact that there are localized positions of the orbiting particles within the vortex may also be the result of inertial lift forces within the vortex as the effective reynolds number is less than that in the main channel these particles would be expected to occupy positions further from the wall further investigations would be important to clarify this phenomenon in addition we empirically found that particles cells with diameter greater than critical diameter dcrt experience shear gradient lift force fls which is strong enough to direct those particles into the reservoir experiments with fluorescent particles suggested that dcrt of the current device falls between and figs and while trapping of particles was initiated at rc and remained stable up to rc fluorescence particles remained at focused streamlines in the main channel and were not trapped in the reservoir even for rc nonetheless the critical diameter required for capturing live cells was found to be greater than dcrt of rigid microspheres this could be attributed to the fact that deformable intact cells tend to be focused closer to the channel center than rigid particles deformable cells experience an additional lift force toward the centerline in confined channels thus larger shear gradient lift force e larger cell diameter would be required to direct live cells into vortex required for successful trapping massively parallel sized based particle cell capturing using the system was tested for the ability to enrich larger cells by flowing various concentrations of hela cells mixed with dilute human blood or suspended in culture medium simple two inlet system allowed for easy and rapid solution exchange within the device providing means to flush untrapped smaller cells for enhancement of the final enrichment ratio and the purity of the collected samples figs and figure shows the capturing efficiency as function of the number of cancer cells introduced into the device for each run the capturing efficiency decreased but remained higher than as the number of cells introduced decreased from to cells run moreover the capturing efficiency tends to agree with the value predicted from the cell size distribution of the introduced cell solution since of hela cells were measured to have cell diameter greater than dcrt in addition the capturing efficiency of the device was found to be lower than the average when the solution with high cancer cell concentration cells run was introduced to the system presumably such high cell concentration exceeded the trapping capacity of the device e the maximum number of cells that each reservoir can trap and sustain based on our experiments the maximum number of cells that each reservoir can effectively capture is estimated to range from to cells depending on cell size furthermore collected hela cells remained highly viable and proliferated for over week suggesting that the cell trapping mechanism using microscale vortices was not detrimental to normal function and growth as proof of concept using the significant difference in size between cancer and blood cells we conducted label free enrichment and collection of cancer cells figs and enhanced breast cancer cells mcf were enriched by factor of with capturing efficiency while cervical cancer cells hela were enriched by times with the lower er and of hela cells can be attributed to the smaller average cell size of hela cells aave compared to that of mcf cells aave moreover the reduction in for the spiking experiments could result from particle particle interactions caused by the presence of high number of blood cells in the sample and or ii relatively higher number of cancer cells introduced the system cancer cells run in addition given the preliminary nature of the current studies it is likely that the er and of the current technique can be further increased by changing the reservoir geometry from square to rectangle w as the size of vortices is expected to be larger and ii larger particle cells will experience the shear gradient lift force directed toward the vortex core for longer duration the throughput of the current device is estimated to be cells when the device is operated at rc with dilute whole blood hematocrit and it can be further enhanced by simply parallelizing more channels or decreasing blood dilution factor indeed the total throughput was increased by eightfold from to cells when eight single channels each with ten reservoirs were placed in parallel this parallel device can concentrate larger rare cells g ctcs from ml of peripheral blood and resuspend these cells into nl of purified processed sample with the collected sample purity as high as e more than three orders of magnitude increase in volumetric concentration factor here the purity of the collected sample was determined from the number cell ratio between cancer and blood cells at the outlet the ability to concentrate cells of interest in small volume will enhance the overall throughput of current state of the art image based target cell detection systems when the present device is integrated upfront of such systems additionally integrating this system upfront of current cytopathology or immunocytochemistry will expedite diagnostic and or prognostic processes as the volume area to be scanned examined would be considerably reduced compared to current methods it is still unclear whether the size of ctcs will correspond with those of cultured cancer cells although reports have identified that cell size can be used as biomarker for metastatic cells although the enrichment ratio and capturing efficiency of the current systems in these preliminary studies are considerably lower when compared to the state of art techniques the approach is label free and simple with extreme throughput the system extreme throughput can compensate for efficiency in many cases by processing more samples to obtain the same amount or more number of cells similarly simplicity of the system will allow massive parallelization and multiplex cascading of the target cell purifying processes for further enhancement of capturing efficiency and enrichment ratio furthermore the presented label free sized based target cell isolating technique would enable collection of viable intact multicellular ctc clusters which could provide an important prognostic factor we have demonstrated unique phenomenon whereby laminar vortices act to selectively isolate particles above critical cutoff size using this phenomenon we have developed and evaluated an innovative microfluidic device for size based cell isolation the critical diameter of cells was found to be larger than that of rigid particles in agreement with effects from deformability induced lift forces arising in confined flow moreover viable cancer cells spiked in dilute rbc lysed blood were isolated and collected off chip without compromising the capturing efficiency and the throughput the presented technology improves on current technology by enriching cells based on size without clogging mechanical filters employing only simple single layered microfluidic device and processing cell solutions at the ml min scale in contrast to filters cells can also be easily released after capture in the vortices the process is gentle not adversely damaging cells suggesting potential to enable cell enrichment by size from blood or tissue digests for future therapeutic uses and molecular analysis  the overall traffic of droplets in network of microfluidic channels is strongly influenced by the liquid properties of the moving droplets in particular the effective hydrodynamic resistance of individual droplets plays key role in their global behavior here we propose two simple and low cost experimental methods for measuring this parameter by analyzing the dynamics of regular sequence of droplets injected into an asymmetric loop network the choice of droplet taking either route through the loop is influenced by the presence of previous droplets that modulate the hydrodynamic resistance of the branches they are sitting in we propose to extract the effective resistance of droplet from easily observable time series namely from the choices the droplets make at junctions and from the interdroplet distances this becomes possible when utilizing recently proposed theoretical model based on number of simplifying assumptions here we present several sets of measurements of the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets expressed in terms of resistance length the aim is twofold to reveal its dependence on number of parameters such as the viscosity the volume of droplets their velocity as well as the spacing between them at the same time by using standard measurement technique we compare the limitations of the proposed methods as an important result of this comparison we obtain the range of validity of the simplifying assumptions made in the theoretical model droplets in microfluidic channels are widely used as microreactors for chemical analysis for chemical kinetics studies or for example as tool for continuous nanoparticle synthesis propelled by the necessity to accommodate parallel processes and to sample or sort droplet populations the demands for microfluidic networks to implement certain procedural targets keep on increasing one strategy toward the parallel processing of many droplets are self regulated channel networks in which it is not necessary to control the route of individual droplets by external means valves but in which well chosen channel design leads to an autonomous behavior of the droplet train the advantage of this approach is evident as the channel geometries stay simple and less external devices are required drawback of the approach is an increased complexity in the understanding of the droplet dynamics making it more difficult to find robust implementations of given tasks general features of self regulated droplet dynamics are the global coupling of the dynamics meaning that nearly all droplets influence each other and the strong nonlinearity in the equations describing the droplet positions as function of time the nonlocal and nonlinear droplet dynamics has been described in ref by simplified theoretical model in this model each droplet sitting in one connecting channel increases the hydrodynamic resistance of this channel by given constant amount by its presence it changes the flow rate in the channel and in turn it changes also the flow rates in possibly all other channels of the network when droplet arrives at junction rule is required to decide which of the possible exits is to be taken here it will be assumed that it takes the channel with the highest instantaneous flow rate the simplified model in ref was able to address several intriguing properties of different network layouts such as the reversibility of the droplet dynamics and the influence of network symmetry the model was proposed as simple tool for finding robust dynamical behavior and to quantify its response to changes in the driving parameters and the geometrical parameters of the network while applying the model calculations to existing devices it turned out that the most important parameter for robust behavior is the effective hydrodynamic resistance of droplets compared to its important role in the overall dynamics of droplets in network this property has not attracted sufficient interest at least for droplets of viscous fluid as first guess it was therefore assumed to be constant in the model in this paper we present results from three methods for measuring the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets being transported in microchannels standard method that employs pressure sensor as reference and two new self regulated low cost methods that do not require laborious external equipment these novel methods follow the idea of the abovementioned self regulated networks here we propose to make use of the overall droplet dynamics which is easily observable with video device in order to extract effective properties such as the hydrodynamic resistance as we make use of self regulating droplet dynamics which requires theoretical model for its interpretation the target here is twofold as long as the assumptions of the model from ref hold the property extracted from the measurement is really the hydrodynamic resistance of the droplets at the same time we verify these very assumptions by checking the consistency of the outcome and by directly measuring the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets with the standard pressure sensor the paper is organized as follows first in sec ii we explain the principles of the methods the specific advantages and limitations of each of them first the well established method based on the use of an external pressure sensor and then the principle of the new methods relying on the flow of regular train of droplets in loop device we distinguish between two different sizes of the loop giving different weights to the underlying assumptions on which the interpretation is based in sec iii we describe the experimental procedure we used for creating the device section iv contains the experimental findings of the two variants of the loop method and of the method using pressure sensor there we discuss in detail the implication of the measurements being in favor of the simple model or putting its assumptions into question the pressure experiments were conducted using differential pressure sensor as described by adzima and velankar at distance of mm two pressure taps were connected to long straight channel as depicted in fig at each of them the pressure is measured by pressure sensor validyne d equipped with psi membrane by comparing the pressure differences in two situations namely with and without droplets while keeping the total flow rate the same we infer the additional pressure caused by the presence of droplets between the taps the hydrodynamic resistance rd of each droplet is then given byrd pnq where and are the pressure differences between the taps with and without droplets respectively in the discussion below it will prove convenient to express hydrodynamic resistances in terms of lengths this is natural for channels without droplets where the hydrodynamic resistance i of channel is known to scale linearly with its length li li wh r witha htanh w here and are the channel width and height respectively is the viscosity of the continuous phase and the dimensionless parameter depends on the shape of the channel cross section which is rectangular here we apply the same factor of linearity from eq also to the effective resistances rd of the droplets in order to define their resistance length ld ld wh rd the pressure sensor is used below in sec iv to compare the results of the alternative passive methods presented in the sections ii and ii below it is important to note that this equipment is quite costly several hundreds of dollars and that it presents number of limitations in terms of response time and ease of use the smaller the probed channel the larger is the equilibration time in the case of our channels which are quite large high and wide this equilibration time was found to be of the order of min figure shows the pressure difference at the two taps as function of time exhibiting the slow relaxation of the signal at the beginning and at the end of droplet series the following passive methods allow to get rid of these constraints the loop here we propose two variants of new method that allows to extract the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets from the observed behavior of regular droplet trains this approach has the advantage over the standard pressure sensor in that it is cheap and does not require taps which pose an additional source of perturbation of the flow furthermore it can be applied without problems to very small channels where the pressure sensor technique becomes inapplicable of course our method has its limitations the main limitations come from the hypotheses made in the theoretical model on which the interpretation of recorded droplet behavior is based it will turn out in sec iv that these assumptions are not always satisfied nevertheless in those regions where they do hold the new method presents real alternative to the pressure sensor we use very simple network of microfluidic channels as depicted in fig disregarding the part in which droplets are generated it consists of two long channels with an asymmetric circular loop in between periodic sequence of droplets is generated and injected into this loop from one side the droplets then take either the short or the long branch of the loop depending on how many droplets the respective branches contain for the first droplet the shorter branch is certainly favorable it has higher flow rate and smaller hydrodynamic resistance the arriving first droplet then increases the hydrodynamic resistance of this shorter branch possibly so much that the following droplet takes the longer route upon continuation complicated sequence of droplet decisions is generated exhibiting complex periodicity the same network topology has been used in refs and to investigate the reversibility of the droplet dynamics the droplet traffic in the network was recorded by charge coupled device ccd camera and processed with homemade matlab program as such we extracted from the movies the velocities of all droplets the number of droplets in each channel and the temporal and spatial periods of the incoming droplet sequence these properties were then plugged into the theoretical model in order to extract the hydrodynamic resistances according to the two methods described in the following the flow through the devices is governed by flow equations that resemble kirchhoff law for electric circuits at each junction the sum of incoming and outgoing flow rates must vanish this means for the loop deviceqtot qs with qtot as the total flow rate in the input output channels and qs and as the flow rates in the short and long branches of the loop here and in the following indices and stand for the short and the long channels respectively the second set of equations provides the relationship between the pressure difference along channel and the flow rate passing through it i riqi at the moment this equation is nothing but the definition of the total hydrodynamic resistance ri of channel without any droplets it is known to provide linear relation in that the resistance does not depend on the total flow rate before describing the dynamics of droplets in the two geometries we used let us summarize the assumptions which led to the simplified model and which will be investigated experimentally in section iv all droplets in channel have the same velocity vi its value is proportional to the total flow rate qi in the channel oil water glycerol with constant factor of proportionality vi sqi here is the cross section which does not change was found to be approximately in our experiments each droplet adds the same amount rd to the total resistance ri of channel such thatri i nird with ni the number of droplets in the channel and with i its resistance in the absence of droplets the resistance rd of droplets should be constant in particular rd should not depend on the flow rate qi or on vi at junctions droplets take the route with the highest flow rate leading away from the junction some comments on the assumptions and their expected validity are in order at this point the linearity of velocity and total flow rate has been observed under experimental conditions both in fig and in ref assumption will prove false if there is cooperative behavior between the droplets such effects will not occur as long as the droplets are sufficiently distant we will quantify the necessary distance in the experimental section around fig assumption will also fail if the droplets have different sizes or if they are smaller than the channel and are thus not forced to be centered assumption is nothing else than the linearity of eq in fact we will present deviations that are important for small velocities but not for larger ones also in the case of long pluglike droplets nonlinearity in eq and therefore velocity dependence of rd must be expected such effects have been reported for bubbles by construction of our device which is by virtue of its simple geometry we do not require assumption for the method to be valid finally assumption will not be questioned here the precise criterion whether it is the highest flow rate the highest pressure drop or the largest velocity that counts does not seem to be important in our case as we use locally symmetric junctions and the same channel cross sections everywhere the small loop the first variant of the proposed device comprises small loop as shown in fig the two branches of the loop are of the order of ten times longer than their width the idea of the method is to send in periodic sequence of droplets and to vary slowly their initial distance if one starts with quite large distance the droplets will all take the short route and leave the loop before the next one arrives see fig for continuously reduced initial distance one finds sudden change in the droplet behavior at specific distance max the droplets start to influence each other the following droplet will take the long route because the previous one still enhances the resistance of the short branch this situation is depicted in fig of course in order to make the method work the yet unknown hydrodynamic resistance of single droplet must be larger than the difference in resistances of the channels when no droplets populate them the applicability can therefore be adjusted by choosing the length ratio ls the hydrodynamic resistance of the droplet is determined from the value of the initial distance max at which the droplets stop taking the entire short branch by applying the simple eq below which we will derive now the initial distance max is obtained as the distance which an approaching droplet can travel while the previous one traverses the short branch the time which droplet stays in the short branch is expressed as follows when assumption is used lsvs sls qs where ls vs and qs are the length the velocity and the flow rate in the short arm respectively in the same time span another droplet in the incoming channel covers the length max sqtot which leads to the elimination of the parameters and and which leaves us with maxls qtotqs qs now we make use of assumption together with eq as the pressure difference is the same in both branches of the loop we obtain for the ratio of their flow ratesq qs rsr ls ldl here it proves convenient to express the hydrodynamic resistances in terms of lengths as defined in eq combining the last two equations we find the result already given in ref maxls lsl ldl which can easily be resolved for ld note that we did not make use of assumption in this short derivation equation therefore holds for any nonlinear relationship between qs and the resistance rd qs of the droplet it is the simple geometry of the device that allows to circumvent the simplifying assumption which is not possible in extended networks note also the nice property of this formula that the hydrodynamic resistance length of the droplet is only given by geometrical properties namely the two lengths of the branches and by the experimentally determined initial distance max between droplets this means that once the device has been elaborated the measure of the droplet resistance is simply obtained from observing the droplets taking different routes through the loop note also that the determination of the droplet resistance from this device relies strongly on assumption and only weakly on assumption assumption is not used at all and assumption is unimportant since we treat one droplet per channel which is the trivial case for here the limitation of the described small loop method is that the two branches are quite short violation of the above derivation might occur in that the resistance rd depends on the instantaneous distances between droplet and the two junctions both of which perturb the flow in nontrivial manner leading to an effective hydrodynamic interaction between them in this aspect the smaller the channel cross section is the better the small loop device works this will lead to more uniform flow and at the same time increase the resistance of droplets the large loop we propose second variant of the loop device which allows to determine the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets with different weighting of the assumptions this time the loop is much larger compared to the previous geometry see fig like for the small loop device regular train of droplets is injected into the main channel this time there can be several to many droplets in each branch of the loop and their resistance is determined by counting the droplets in each branch every time new droplet has made its decision thus the droplet dynamics depends on the model assumptions in different way according to assumption each droplet entering the loop systematically goes into the branch of lower hydrodynamic resistance also since each droplet adds certain resistance to the channel assumption it tends to equilibrate the hydrodynamic resistances of the two branches of the loop the same principle has been previously used in the analysis of the hydrodynamic resistance of bubbles however only in the case of symmetric loop and without the complementary device with small loop during the run of the experiment the total hydrodynamic resistances of the two branches change as functions of the numbers of droplets they already contain we thus have to track the relation between these two resistances s nsrd n rd where both comparison operators are found each time droplet has chosen route we gain some information about which branch of the loop has had the smaller total resistance in fact each time droplet chooses the longer branch we obtain lower bound for rd the short branch provides an upper bound when resolving eq for rd rewritten in terms of the corresponding length ld we obtain these bounds as lsns long ld lsns short the subscripts long and short indicate that the specified bound applies only if the long short branch has been chosen observing many droplets will successively narrow the bounds on ld leaving finally an interval that depends on both the initial droplet spacing and on the length ratio ls large loop that is nearly symmetric leads to good accuracy of the method figure shows two examples of how eq is applied leading in fig to lower bound and in fig to an upper bound in terms of the assumptions required for the analysis this large loop method appears to be complementary to the small loop variant here we make heavy use of assumption in that we assume the droplets to add up their individual resistances on the contrary the small loop proposition was mainly based on assumption which is not really required here because the time the droplets stay in both branches of the loop is not used also the role of the droplet velocity is different while the flow rates in the two branches of the small loop device can be very different they are automatically balanced here at least their average values with fluctuations due to the fluctuating numbers of droplets we made the microfluidic devices out of poly dimethyl siloxane pdms using standard photolithographic and soft lithographic techniques transparency mask of dots in resolution cad art services inc california was used in contact photolithography with su photoresist microchem newton ma to generate negative master consisting of patterned su photoresist on silicon wafer with flat surface positive replicas were formed by molding mixture of pdms with temperature active cross linker against the master after curing the pdms layer for min at it was peeled off the silicon wafer and inlet and outlet holes were punched glass slide serving as the rigid substrate of the device was covered by thin layer of mixture of pdms cross linker and cured during min at the pdms surfaces were then activated with an uvo cleaner jelight ax for and both pdms surfaces were immediately brought together an irreversible seal was formed between the pdms surface and the glass substrate the resulting rectangular microchannels are high and wide droplets were fabricated from droplet generator with cross junction fig inlets for different liquids one of oil viscosity of cp and one for glycerol water mixture lead into channel located downstream the junction colorant bromothymol blue was added to this aqueous phase in order to increase the contrast of the droplet external connections to syringes hamilton ml were made using polyethylene pe medical tubing outer diameter mm the syringes were contracted by three programable syringe pumps cetoni nemesys controlled by computer an additional oil inlet further downstream served to vary the spatial period between droplets without modifying the volumes of the droplets their volumes were inferred from all three incoming flow rates and the measured droplet distance in this section we present several sets of measurements in which different parameters are varied we measure their influence on the hydrodynamic resistance of the droplets in order to see as to what extent assumptions d may be applied the varied parameters are the volume of the droplets their velocity their viscosity and their initial distance all these parameters influence the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets which strictly speaking invalidates assumptions and nevertheless we will show that reliable results can be obtained with the newly proposed methods their reliability is enforced by the comparison with the results from the pressure sensor as reference the first two presented results coincide well and show that the proposed small loop and large loop devices can be used to determine the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets from the remaining results we learn that the assumptions underlying these methods are not fulfilled for all driving parameters at first sight this appears as bad news for the methods we propose however we also find that there is always parameter regime in which the assumptions are indeed valid concretely we find that both the droplet velocity and the interdroplet distance must be kept sufficiently large if we ensure that the velocity does not drop below critical value while varying for example the distance the result is perfectly valid we may use such situation to extract the hydrodynamic resistance of the droplets the results given in this section therefore present both direct verification of the assumptions of the employed model and measurement of the hydrodynamic resistance independent of the parameter variations fig shows that assumption holds in the performed experiments influence of the droplet the influence of the volume of droplets on their hydrodynamic resistance has been investigated with the pressure sensor and with the small loop device the results in fig depict strong increase in the resistance with the volume which is confirmed by the measurements of the pressure sensor both methods yield coinciding values for the resistance the increase can be understood by the fact that with growing volume the droplets fill the channel more closely and become longer similar effects have been reported in refs and droplets of nl are nearly spherical when looked at from above larger droplets are more elongated giving rise to thin films of oil between the droplets and the channel walls the viscous dissipation in these thin films is one of three possible reasons for the enhancement of hydrodynamic resistance due to the presence of droplet generally speaking each droplet perturbs the surrounding flow field which would otherwise be an axial poiseuille type flow see fig and ref the kinematic boundary condition at the boundary of the droplet enforces the presence of several counter rotating eddies inside and outside the droplet figure contains only those eddies that are necessary to ensure continuous velocity field in particular the tangent velocity has to be continuous at the droplet boundary due to their different viscosities the eddies inside and outside the droplet may contribute differently to the total hydrodynamic resistance of droplet third contribution comes from the thin fluid film between droplet interface and channel wall its reduced thickness leads to large velocity gradients and thus also to viscous dissipation as the droplet resistances at different volumes are compared it is not only the thin film contribution which changes together with the more elongated shape of the interfaces also the precise shape of the interior eddies changes the viscous dissipation within the droplet strongly depends on the details of the eddies in particular on the ratio between the round backflows near the caps of the droplet and the rather poiseuille like parts in the interior of long droplet at this point nothing can be said about the relative importance of the viscous dissipation in the thin film and in the eddies we will return to this point below in the discussion of the distance between droplets in the experiment in fig the range of droplet volumes is limited as large droplets tend to break or deform and wait in the incoming junction of the loop the waiting time in the junction causes an overestimation of ld by eq note that in the small loop model of sec the new route is chosen instantaneously and does not take any waiting time into account there is also lower bound for the applicable droplet volume given by the channel cross section as soon as the droplets have no contact with the channel walls their resistance strongly decreases however we require their resistance to be large enough to overgrow the asymmetry of the loop influence of the total flow according to assumption the hydrodynamic resistance length ld should neither depend on the total flow rate in the channel nor on the velocity of the droplet in fact we found that this is the case only for velocities higher than approximately vtot mm as fig indicates at small droplet velocities we find very large hydrodynamic resistances the droplet resistance decreases with increasing velocity until only weak dependence is observed beyond vtot mm the data plotted in fig have been obtained from the large loop device and are in good agreement with the reference measurement it is important to stress this agreement as it shows that the large loop device indeed measures the droplet resistances and that it does not depend on assumption as was already explained at the end of sec the velocity value vtot in the measurement is the one in the incoming channel which is systematically different from the true velocity at which the droplets move in the large loop device however we find automatically balanced flow rates and therefore also balanced velocities in the two branches which allows one to say that both are half the incoming velocity vs vtot at least on average that we obtain the true velocity immediately from measurement in the straight part of the channel is the reason why we performed this experiment with the large loop device and not with the small loop device where the velocity ratios depend on the droplet resistances unless the droplet velocity is sufficiently high the measurements in fig have been performed using droplets of the same volume and the same composition the velocity was varied by injecting more oil between the droplets together with the total flow rate thus also the initial spacing between the droplets was varied between and mm the origin of the strong increase in resistance at small velocities is unclear at the moment we found correlation with the shape of the droplets inset in fig indicating systematic lengthening of the fast flowing droplets this increases the thickness of the thin oil film between the droplet and the walls and reduces the total resistance of the droplets dynamical theory which would allow to fit the droplet resistances given in fig is not known to us in fact we tried to fit the data to the existing formulas for the resistance as function of the droplet size and of the velocity in ref proposition containing scaling with is put forward for bubbles in ref the scaling is rather neither formula yielded remotely satisfactorily result for the data in fig the details of the surrounding flow and of the internal circulation in the droplet are evidently much more important than in the case of bubbles where simple scaling approach seems to work influence of the droplet another set of experiments with the small loop device explores the influence of the viscosity of the glycerol water mixture inside the droplets on their resistance the viscosity was changed by varying the concentrations of glycerol and of water in the mixture the continuous phase and the velocity were kept constant figure depicts the resulting resistance length ld as function of the fluid viscosity in the droplet the values of ld remain approximately constant as long as the droplet viscosity is lower than the viscosity of the surrounding phase beyond this value they exhibit strong increase which can be attributed to the enhanced viscous dissipation by the internal circulation in the droplets similar effects have been observed in ref the agreement between the results of the small loop device and the pressure sensor is mediocre we do not have convincing explanation for the deviations at the moment nevertheless the two measurements exhibit the same ascending trend as described above the velocity of the droplets was quite fast in order to stay within the part of fig where the velocity does not strongly influence the resistance length we chose this regime in order to clearly separate the respective influence of the viscosity from others the qualitative form of the flow fields are depicted in the sketch of the counter rotating eddies in fig the two panels of the figure present two different topologies for the two extreme cases of the ratio these two topologies are expected because the fluid with higher viscosity should avoid producing several eddies each of which increases the viscous dissipation despite the fact that there are two clearly distinguished regimes of the function ld in fig in one of which it is nearly constant in the other it is fast growing we find rather smooth change from one regime to the other and not an abrupt one at the point of equal viscosity the curve may further be extrapolated to an infinite droplet viscosity in which the result of nearly filling rigid object in channel is reached the resistance of such an object depends solely on its filling property that is on the thin film between object and walls it is then only the ratio of surface tension and exterior viscosity exterior capillary number that determines the thickness of the thin film we now discuss possible cooperative effects between adjacent droplets and thus explore the validity of assumption of course this can only be undertaken by the large loop device since the small loop contains not more than one droplet upon varying the initial distance between droplets we find indeed critical droplet spacing below which assumption does not hold any more figure visualizes this result as measured by the large loop device for small distances an increase in the droplet resistance as function of the distance can be seen beyond approximately mm we find an apparent plateau the large uncertainties in this part of the data are caused by the small number of droplets in the branches of the loop for any given maximal size of the large loop results maximal reasonable droplet distance the uncertainties can however be reduced either by using ratio ls closer to unity or by investigating narrower channels in the latter case the droplet distance up to which cooperative effects occur should be decreased together with the width height of the channel the necessity to work at distances larger than mm in order to guarantee the validity of assumption has already been taken into account in the previously described measurements the decrease in resistance at distances smaller than mm gives evidence to collective motion of the droplet this means that pair or series of droplets can be displaced more easily than the same number of individual droplets this observation sheds light on the relative importance of the three different contributions to the hydrodynamic resistance as mentioned above in the discussion of fig in the literature on inviscid bubbles the contribution from the thin film has been considered as the primary reason for hydrodynamic resistance the decrease in resistance observed in the measurements in fig proves that in our case the thin film contribution cannot be dominant but that the eddies outside of the droplet contribute equally from fig we can estimate the size of the eddies the incoming distances of mm correspond to minimal distance between droplets of around mm in the branches where the droplet sequences are not regular anymore the diameter of the exterior eddies are then around mm thus two times the width of the channel note that for experimental reasons the three relevant parameters namely droplet velocity droplet spacing and the droplet volume cannot all be independently controlled therefore this set of experiments has not been performed at constant flow rate inset in fig there is thus hidden influence of the droplet velocity on ld which should pronounce the dependence on even more the full function ld vtot d can only be fully displayed in high dimensional plot nontrivial dependence of the parameters is found when varying two of them at the same time figure shows such an example namely the resistance length ld as function of the drop volume the small loop data have already been presented in fig the corresponding large loop resistances are systematically smaller the error bars and an independent measurement with the pressure sensor both indicate that the difference is not an artifact the discrepancy is misleading since the difference here is due to the smaller interdroplet distance of approximately mm in the large loop experiment for the volume of nl we find the same value ld mm in fig at this very distance the resistance length when measured with the small loop device is approximately mm at volume of nl this value is approximately the one of the plateau at large distances in fig we may thus conclude that the small loop device really measures the resistances of individual droplets and that this resistance corresponds to the plateau at large distances in the large loop device figure leads us to comment which we consider central in the analysis of droplet traffic in networks when droplets are driven through complex and possibly large network of microfluidic channels comprising lot of junctions then no direct control over parameters such as their distance or their velocity is possible when the droplet trains in an existing device exhibit irregularities e that they do not follow the trajectory they are supposed to follow in order to fulfill the objective of the device then it will become necessary to understand the droplet dynamics in more detail the present work demonstrates some aspects of this understanding for simple device where the mutual influence of the hydrodynamic resistance and the droplet movement becomes apparent in the present paper we use three methods to measure the effective hydrodynamic resistance of droplets in microchannels one standard method based on the use of pressure sensors and two variants of new method relying on the analysis of droplet trajectories in simple microfluidic device these two variants are proposed as complementary techniques as they are based on different model assumptions on the droplet behavior in the microfluidic network the main idea put forward here is to use the global droplet dynamics namely the distances between droplets their number in each branch of the loop and the choices taken at the first junction all of them can simply be extracted by analyzing video of the droplets flowing the methods are noninvasive as they do not require additional measuring channels for pressure sensors nor do they require expensive equipment the interpretation of these observables to obtain the resistances is based on theoretical model the simplifying assumptions of which we test in the present work the proposed methods focus rather on the understanding of the droplet dynamics than on the isolated measurement of the all parameter dependence of the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets in this sense it is not meant to replace the standard method employing pressure sensors but rather to provide guided example for how the droplet dynamics reacts on variations in the hydrodynamic resistance and vice versa we were able to show that there exists parameter regime where the assumptions adopted by the model do hold in this regime the quantity that we extracted from the experimental observations indeed serves as the wanted hydrodynamic resistance of droplets these results are presented in figs and where we varied different parameters namely the volume velocity and viscosity of droplets as well as their distance all these sets of measurements were done in way such that they avoid those parameter regimes where the model assumptions are not valid therefore they do not contradict each other this claim is enforced by independent and more direct measures of the droplet resistances undertaken with an expensive and elaborate pressure sensor technique the requirement to find the formerly unknown valid part of high dimensional parameter space presented the main intellectual difficulty while generating the results displayed in the figures the parameter dependencies we found are the following the hydrodynamic resistance increases with increasing volume and increasing viscosity of the droplet it increases with interdroplet distances as long as the distances are smaller than approximately mm beyond that value the resistance does not depend on the interdroplet distance for small droplet velocities the resistance strongly decreases with increasing velocity it changes only little for velocities beyond mm on more fundamental level of description the results presented here demand systematic determination of the hydrodynamic resistance as function of droplet volume spacing velocity and viscosity this could be done for example by extending refs and which are concerned with the resistance of inviscid bubbles not droplets in the limit of high velocities large distances and small volumes the resistance will still turn out to be constant as assumed by the simple model used here  control over the co emission via automobiles and industrial exhaust in atmosphere is one of the major concerns to render environmental friendly milieu adsorption can be considered to be one of the more promising methods offering potential energy savings compared to absorbent systems different carbon nanostructures activated carbon and carbon nanotubes have attracted attention as co adsorbents due to their unique surface morphology in the present work we have demonstrated the co adsorption capacity of graphene prepared via hydrogen induced exfoliation of graphitic oxide at moderate temperatures the co adsorption study was performed using high pressure sieverts apparatus and capacity was calculated by gas equation using van der waals corrections physical adsorption of co molecules in graphene was confirmed by ftir study synthesis of graphene sheets via hydrogen exfoliation is possible at large scale and lower cost and higher adsorption capacity of as prepared graphene compared to other carbon nanostructures suggests its possible use as co adsorbent for industrial application maximum adsorption capacity of mmole was observed at bar pressure and room temperature increasing emission of green house gases due to industrialization is one of the major concerns faced by our generation in the second decade of this new millennium co is considered as major anthropogenic contribution to climate change cement steel and automobile industries are responsible for the increasing concentration of co in our milieu as the development of any country largely depends on its industrial growth it has been long demanding task to control the co emission in atmosphere the co capture and storage ccs technologies from flue gas are considered to be cost effective means for reducing the co content in the environment various co capture technologies including absorption adsorption cryogenics and membranes etc are under study among those alternatives the technology considered nowadays as mature is co scrubbing using amine solutions however high energy requirements for solvent regeneration extensive corrosion of the equipment and the impact of the amine solutions life cycle on the surrounding ecosystems are being of major concern for the continuous use of this technology adsorption is known to be an alternative solution of the above problems associated with co absorption in amine based solutions the ability to regenerate an adsorbent and the ease of its regeneration are also important consideration different porous materials like zeolite based molecular sieves activated carbons acs carbon nanotubes cnts have attracted the attention of researchers for gas adsorption acs generally give higher additional capacity at pressures greater than atmospheric compared to zeolites further acs are often preferred over zeolites because of their relatively moderate strengths of adsorption for gases which facilitates easier desorption cnts have been also investigated as alternative for co adsorption due to their large surface area and high porosity however the cost of cnts is of still concern graphene as new class of carbon nanomaterials is found to be economical and has novel properties similar to cnts use of graphene in different applications like supercapacitor fuel cells and photovoltaic is of immense interest to the current scientific research storage capacity of graphene for different gases has been suggested in theoretical studies and co adsorption capacity is demonstrated at very low temperature which has not much practical implication therefore there is need to investigate the co adsorption capacity of graphene at room temperature and moderate pressure for practical application of graphene in ccs technology in the present work graphene sheets were synthesized by hydrogen induced thermal exfoliation of graphitic oxide at a technique developed by our group for possible large scale production of graphene adsorption capacity of heg for co was studied by high pressure sieverts apparatus at three different temperatures and using pressure reduction technique physical adsorption of co in graphene sheets was confirmed using ftir spectroscopy graphene sheets were synthesized by exfoliation technique to prepare graphene sheets graphitic oxide was prepared first by oxidation of pure graphite using hummers method in this method the oxidation of graphite to graphitic oxide is accomplished by treating graphite with essentially water free mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid sodium nitrate and potassium permanganate this graphitic oxide was further thermally exfoliated at under hydrogen atmosphere this thermal shock under the presence of hydrogen gas leads to formation of graphene sheets as prepared graphene sheets were named as hydrogen exfoliated graphene heg due to use of hydrogen in the exfoliation process as prepared graphene sheets were further characterized by ray diffraction transmission electron microscopy raman spectroscopy and surface area analysis adsorption studies for co gas were carried out using high pressure sieverts apparatus schematic description of sieverts apparatus is given elsewhere adsorption capacity was calculated by incorporating van der waals corrections in gas equation desorption of co was performed at under high vacuum bar after each cycle of adsorption adsorption capacity was found almost repeatable in the next cycle of adsorption suggesting the regeneration of heg for further use figure shows the xrd pattern of pure graphite graphite oxide and heg xrd pattern of pure graphite shows high intensity peak around corresponding to the graphitic structure after oxidation the peak of graphite powder disappears and an additional peak at is observed which is corresponding to the diffraction peak of graphite oxide oxidation of graphite leads to the increase in spacing which can be attributed to the oxide induced oxygen containing functional groups and inserted water molecules xrd pattern of heg shows very less intense peak around indicates the distorted graphite structure and hence suggests the formation of graphene sheets tem image figure shows the morphological structure of heg the rapid removal of intercalated oxygen atoms and other functional groups in graphitic oxide during exfoliation results in wrinkled structure of graphene sheets figure shows the raman spectrum of heg it shows two peaks corresponding to band cm and band cm for heg band corresponds to the defects induced in the graphitic structure while band corresponds to the in plane vibrations of the graphitic structure almost equal intensity of band and band suggests small crystalline size and hence very few numbers of layers bet surface area measurement of heg figure asserts the large hysteresis area of adsorption desorption isotherm suggesting the wide distributions of pores the specific surface area of heg calculated using bet equation was found to be g large hysteresis area indicates near uniform distribution of pores and large surface area of heg suggesting the high quality of synthesized graphene sheets as synthesized graphene sheets possess much larger special surface area which indicates that the average particle size of graphite has been decreased during oxidation and rapid heating process under hydrogen atmosphere amount of co adsorbed in mole was measured by calculating the number of moles of gas in the system before and after adsorption process number of moles of gas in the system can be calculated by following equation documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation abn avn rt pb n pv end equation end document abn avn rt pb n pv where is the number of moles of gas present in volume of the system at pressure and temperature constants and are the van der waals constants for co gas figure shows the adsorption isotherms of co for heg at three different temperatures adsorption capacities of and mmole were observed at bar pressure and and temperatures respectively it is evident from the isotherms that at each temperature the adsorption capacity increases with the increase in equilibrium pressure this is attributed to the possible multilayer adsorption of co molecules in pores at high pressures figure shows dependence of co adsorption capacity on temperature for heg and suggests decrease in capacity with increase in temperature at higher temperatures co gas molecules posses high kinetic energy and hence higher desorption rate of co is possible this results in lower adsorption capacity of heg at higher temperatures at lower temperatures the co molecules possess lower kinetic energies and therefore possible condensation of gas takes place molecular adsorption of co in heg was confirmed using ftir study figure shows the ftir spectrum of co adsorbed heg the band corresponding to hydroxyl group oh stretching cm is quite prominent as compared to the insignificant ratios of anti symmetric and symmetric ch vibrations and cm for heg intense peaks corresponding to the carboxylic and carbonyl groups were observed at c ch and cm o an additional peak was observed at cm this peak corresponds to the adsorbed molecular co in heg and suggests the physical adsorption of co adsorption capacity of heg for co was found higher to other carbon nanostructures like acs cnts and zeolites at same pressure and temperature siriwardane et al have reported mmole of co adsorption in ac gensterblum et al reported nearly mmole of co adsorption in ac at and bar pressure zhang et al have reported around enhancement in co uptake by modifying the ac with nitrogen at room temperature and shown around mmole adsorption capacity at bar in our earlier study on mwnts adsorption capacity was observed and mmole at bar pressure and and temperatures respectively cavenati et al have reported mmole of co adsorption in zeolite at bar pressure and room temperature high pressure co adsorption study on different metal organic frameworks by millward and yaghi exhibits co adsorption capacity ranging from mmole under similar conditions in summary heg shows higher adsorption capacity for co compared to other carbon nanostructures and zeolites which may be directly attributed to the higher surface area of heg regeneration property and high adsorption capacity of heg make it suitable candidate for ccs technology additionally cost effective production of heg opens the wide area of research for the investigation of heg based nanocomposites to achieve even higher co capture capacity to compete with commercial requirements  isolation and enumeration of circulating tumor cells ctcs are used to monitor metastatic disease progression and guide cancer therapy however currently available technologies are limited to cells expressing specific cell surface markers such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule epcam or have limited specificity because they are based on cell size alone we developed device apostream that overcomes these limitations by exploiting differences in the biophysical characteristics between cancer cells and normal healthy blood cells to capture ctcs using dielectrophoretic technology in microfluidic flow chamber further the system overcomes throughput limitations by operating in continuous mode for efficient isolation and enrichment of ctcs from blood the performance of the device was optimized using design of experiment approach for key operating parameters such as frequency voltage and flow rates and buffer formulations cell spiking studies were conducted using skov or mda mb cell lines that have high and low expression level of epcam respectively to demonstrate linearity and precision of recovery independent of epcam receptor levels the average recovery of skov and mda mb cancer cells spiked into approximately peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from ml normal human donor blood was and respectively the intra day and inter day precision coefficients of variation of the device were both less than linear regression analysis yielded correlation coefficient of more than for spiking range of cells the viability of mda mb cancer cells captured with apostream was greater than and there was no difference in cell growth up to days in culture compared to controls the apostream device demonstrated high precision and linearity of recovery of viable cancer cells independent of their epcam expression level isolation and enrichment of viable cancer cells from apostream enables molecular characterization of ctcs from wide range of cancer types among the characteristic rate limiting steps of metastatic cancer progression is vascular dissemination of tumor cells normally absent from the peripheral blood of healthy donor circulating tumor cells ctcs are increasingly used as biomarkers from patients with metastatic cancer ctc counts correlate negatively with progression free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal breast and prostate cancer growing evidence suggests that ctc isolation from blood sample may allow reliable early detection and molecular characterization of cancer at diagnosis and may provide minimally invasive method to guide and monitor the results of cancer therapy for example the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor egfr mutations in circulating lung cancer cells has been shown to correlate with reduced progression free survival in addition monitoring the response of circulating breast cancer cells to adjuvant chemotherapy allowed detection of patients at risk of early relapse ctcs are rare cells present in the blood in numbers as low as one ctc per leukocytes which makes their capture and detection very challenging the techniques currently used for ctc capture include immunomagnetic separation membrane filters and micro electro mechanical system mems chips all of these techniques are subject to limitations for example immunomagnetic separation relies on the expression of known cell surface markers such as the epithelial cell adhesion molecule epcam and hence is restricted to few epithelial cancers with high epcam expression ctc enumeration by cellsearch is food and drug administration fda cleared biomarker test that utilizes epcam for ctc capture but indications are limited to metastatic colorectal breast and prostate cancer it is inapplicable to cancers of non epithelial origin such as melanoma brain cancers and sarcomas as well as advanced metastatic disease where epcam expression is lost the immunomagnetic isolation procedure associated with ctc identification with the cellsearch system involves chemical and mechanical manipulation that creates challenges to culture these cells for downstream analysis while isolation of rare cells in viable state may facilitate research into the molecular underpinnings of cancer progression and enable more accurate planning of personalized therapy it remains technologically challenging and is thus underutilized in the medical community development of novel robust technologies for rare cell isolation which create the opportunity to conduct post processing studies on viable cells will be an important advancement toward understanding the biology and clinical applications of rare cells prior studies have successfully demonstrated the ability of dielectrophoretic field flow fractionation dep fff technology to characterize and capture cancer cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs in these earlier studies dep fff was applied using batch mode configuration that limited the number of cells processed in given run because cells must remain spaced by several diameters to avoid dipole dipole interactions that can perturb dep responses as result the loading capacity using the batch mode of operation was limited to less than million cells per run and required processing of multiple batches in order to complete ctc analysis for typical ml blood sample other recent studies reported the use of various types of dep micro devices for cancer cell isolation in preclinical models for example dep has been used to separate colorectal cancer cell lines in microfluidic chip contactless dep microfluidic device was utilized to study the behavior of mouse ovarian cells human cervical carcinoma cell line hela was concentrated using circular microelectrodes dep based printed circuit boards have been used for software controlled entrapment and movement of human tumor cells oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and mouse melanoma clones have been isolated using dep technology human breast cancer cells have been isolated using multi orifice flow fractionation dep device dep activated cell sorter and dc dep device all these devices with the exception of the device described in this study have low throughput which limits their clinical utility as devices for rare cell isolation from blood to overcome the cell throughput limitations of the dep batch mode configuration to allow for the efficient isolation and enrichment of ctcs from whole blood we developed the continuous flow apostream device herein we describe the operational optimization and performance characteristics of apostream to capture cancer cells independent of antigen expression levels such as epcam the apostream technology has the advantage of antibody independent separation of viable cancer cells enabling ctc capture from wide variety of cancer types allowing multiple downstream processes and cell culture expansion theory and device there have been extensive publications on the dielectric properties of dissimilar cells and dep based methods for isolating cells many studies have utilized dep fff methods that exploit the balance of dep forces sedimentation forces and hydrodynamic lift forces to position cells in hydrodynamic flow profile the apostream device uses dep to sort cells with distinct biophysical characteristics by exploiting dissimilarities in the frequency dependent dielectric properties of different cell types that arise from morphologic and electrical conductivity differences the isolation of rare cancer cells from blood in particular exploits differences in dielectric properties between blood cells lymphocytes monocytes and granulocytes and cancer cells for the separation of cancer cells from healthy blood cells the apostream device operates in modified form to conventional dep fff in that the cancer cells are attracted by positive dep forces towards the electrode plane and thus away from the bulk of the blood cells that are levitated by negative dep into the hydrodynamic flow velocity profile this is accomplished by applying the voltage signal at frequency in between the so called dep crossover frequency of cancer cells and pbmcs the crossover frequency is defined as the frequency where the dep force makes the transition from negative to positive force and is dependent on cell and medium conductivity and permittivity the mean crossover frequencies of breast lung and ovarian cancer cell lines were reported to be low khz compared to khz for major peripheral blood cell types at ms eluate buffer conductivity this difference in crossover frequencies forms the basis for isolation of ctcs from complex mixture of cells and is applicable to wide variety of cancer types when frequency in the range of khz is applied the cancer cells experience positive attractive dep force while the blood cells are repelled into the fluid flow with negative dep force resulting in separation the dep force fdep acting on spherical cell of radius suspended in liquid medium of absolute permittivity is given by the relationship fdep sr re fcm where is the rms value of the applied electric field and is the gradient operator re fcm is the real part of the clausius mossotti factor that defines the effective polarizability of the cell relative to that of the suspending medium amongst several simplifying assumptions relevant one for our present studies is that the electric field in the vicinity of the cell is not perturbed by the presence of boundary such as metal or dielectric surface from the studies of lo and lei the ratio of the electrode boundary perturbing force to the dep force is of the order h h where is the height above the electrode plane and is the length scale of the electric field for the interdigitated parallel electrodes used in the apostream device can be taken to be the distance of between opposing electrodes for cell of radius located with its centre above the electrode surface the boundary perturbation would represent only of the primary dep force and does not substantially influence the validity of eq the perturbing influence of the electrode and inter electrode surfaces increases rapidly as the levitation height falls below this level and becomes particularly dependent on the electrode geometry and cell diameter equation can be modified to describe the vertical component of the dep force averaged along horizontal plane acting on cell at height above the electrode plane to the form fdep sr f re fcm h the factor f defines the frequency dependent electrode polarization which becomes an important factor at low frequencies is the applied rms voltage and h reflects the height dependence of the vertical dep force component which above certain levitation height can be taken to decrease smoothly as function of increasing levitation height however at low levitation heights there is sharp departure from the form of eq the details of which depend on the electrode geometry local values of the vertical component of the dep force are determined by the factor in eq with sharp maxima occurring above electrode edges theoretical analysis of the stokes drag force acting on particle brought down by positive dep towards the electrode plane in continuous flow dep chamber requires correction for ill defined wall effects and at these heights there is no linear relation between and the fluid flow rate to give the levitation produced by negative dep these facts preclude detailed theoretical study of the operating parameters for our device and optimization of its performance was performed by simple design of experiment procedure the complete setup of the continuous flow apostream device is shown in figure the gear pump custom made dep signal generator conductivity meter and laser particle counter are computer controlled allowing dynamic feedback control and monitoring the sample injection and collection flow rates are controlled by high precision syringe pumps the captured cancer cells are collected into microcentrifuge tube the apostream flow chamber applies an ac electric field to the sample within defined region of the flow path flexible polyimide film sheet with electroplated copper and gold electrodes forms the floor of the flow chamber an acrylic sheet forms the ceiling of the flow chamber and gasket forms the side walls of the chamber eluate buffer is introduced at the upstream end of the flow chamber the sample is introduced through rectangular port located in the floor of the flow chamber at the upstream end cancer cells are collected through another rectangular port located downstream from the sample inlet port figure the sample is injected at low flow rate into the bottom of the flow chamber to minimize cell levitation and to ensure cells stay within the effective dep field when cells encounter the dep field the dep forces pull cancer cells towards the chamber floor and repel other cells as they traverse the electrode as shown in figure inset cancer cells travelling close to the chamber floor are withdrawn through the collection port while other blood cells traveling at greater heights are carried beyond this port and exit the chamber to the waste container via second outlet port cancer cell isolation the following describes the procedure used for the operation of the apostream device to isolate cancer cells for the performance characterization studies prior to initiating each run the apostream flow chamber was disinfected with ethanol followed by preconditioning with sucrose based eluate buffer with conductivity of ms the low surface tension of the ethanol solution compared to water also aided the avoidance or removal of air bubbles samples were prepared by isolating pbmcs from ml of whole blood using standard ficoll density gradient method pbmcs were spiked with pre stained cancer cells in ml of the optimized sample buffer the cell suspension was loaded in the custom sample injection vessel as shown in figure the sample was injected through the chamber floor using syringe pump gear pump was used to deliver eluate buffer continuously at constant flow rate an ac voltage vp was applied to the electrode to initiate the dep field cancer cells were collected through the collection port at min flow rate into microcentrifuge tube the total run time to process each pbmc sample preparation through apostream was approximately min after each run the flow chamber was cleaned with terg zyme alconox white plains ny detergent solution the protease enzyme in terg zyme breaks down the cell membrane to eliminate cell carryover the locations of the sample injection and sample collection ports with respect to overall flow chamber dimensions are shown in figure videos were captured to demonstrate cancer cell isolation from pbmcs using apostream as shown in figures and in these videos skov cancer cells and pbmcs were pre stained with green fluorescent celltracker dye staining procedure described below and run through the apostream device in independent experiments the videos were taken using an olympus szx fluorescence microscope olympus corporation japan positioned above the flow chamber over the cell collection port portion of the interdigitated electrode viewable as series of light parallel stripes is visible in the figures and cell culture cancer cell lines skov ovarian cancer and mda mb breast cancer were purchased from american type culture collection atcc manassas va skov and mda mb cells were cultured in mccoys medium lonza walkersville md and dmem medium lonza respectively and supplemented with fetal bovine serum and penicillin streptomycin for the spiking studies cancer cells were pre stained with celltracker invitrogen eugene or dye to allow for post apostream enrichment enumeration dye stock solution mm was prepared by adding of sterile dimethyl sulfoxide dmso to of dye powder five of the dye stock solution was added to the cell suspension cells ml and the cells were incubated for min at followed by centrifugation at for min the cells were then washed twice with ml of sterile culture medium and left in the culture medium until spiked into pbmcs from normal donor blood blood was collected from healthy human donors in bd vacutainer tubes bd franklin lakes nj pbmcs were isolated from ml of blood using manufacturers standard density gradient methods ge healthcare uppsala sweden bd franklin lakes nj pbmcs were resuspended in ml of apostream sample buffer prior to further use pre stained cancer cells were spiked into pbmcs and separation was performed using the apostream device to determine mean spiking count the same spiking volumes were pipetted onto microscope slides in triplicate cells were manually counted using an olympus bx fluorescence microscope counts of cancer cells enriched with the apostream device were divided by the mean spiked cell count to determine cell recovery efficiency device the performance of the apostream device was optimized in two series of experiments first the eluate buffer sample injection and sample collection flow rates were optimized to maximize cancer cell recovery while minimizing pbmc contamination second level parameter factorial design of experiment doe using design expert software stat ease minneapolis mn was utilized to optimize frequency voltage and the sample collection rate response surface methodology rsm was utilized to demonstrate the cells response recovery performance to frequency and sample injection rate skov cancer cells lines and normal donor pbmcs were used in independent experiments to optimize the separation parameters and subsequently the skov cells were spiked into pbmcs to assess performance with those optimized parameters following the selection of optimum device parameters experiments were conducted to optimize eluate and sample buffer formulations to maintain cell viability and reduce cell loss sucrose based buffer was used as the eluate and mix of rpmi growth medium with additives was used as the sample buffer the eluate buffer composition included sucrose sigma aldrich st louis mo dextrose fisher hanover il and mm phosphate buffer ph to maintain the cell osmolarity under physiological conditions the eluate buffer conductivity was adjusted to ms using sodium chloride sigma aldrich the sample buffer used to resuspend the cell mixture contains rpmi cell culture growth medium the eluate and the sample buffer formulations were optimized by adding bovine serum albumin bsa sigma aldrich as nutrient and to minimize cell adherence to surfaces pluronic sigma aldrich for cell membrane stability an anti oxidant compound as free radical scavenger and catalase sigma aldrich to decompose hydrogen peroxide the sucrose concentration in the eluate buffer affects the osmolarity of the fluid at concentration of the eluate buffer osmolarity is mos a reduction in the sucrose concentration could be beneficial in downstream analytical processing steps and it has been shown that osmolarity as low as mos does not significantly alter the dielectric properties of the cancer cells therefore the sucrose concentration was included as variable in the buffer optimization study to determine optimum eluate and sample buffer formulations level factor doe spiking study was performed the factors were osmolarity and mos adjusted by changing sucrose concentration eluate buffer with and without additives and sample buffer with and without additives in each of the conditions tested approximately skov cells were spiked into pbmcs obtained from ml of normal human donor blood enumeration of cells recovered after apostream separation was compared to determine the optimum formulations device to demonstrate the performance of the apostream device intra day inter day inter device and inter operator precision and linearity were determined for cancer cell recovery clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi guidelines ep and ep were utilized analyze the precision and linearity respectively precision studies were run with pbmcs isolated from ml of normal healthy donor blood that were spiked with either approximately skov cells or approximately mda mb cells the spiked samples were processed through different apostream devices and flow chambers by multiple operators on multiple days to demonstrate linearity series of experiments were conducted by spiking varying amounts of skov and mda mb cells ranging from to cells into pbmcs obtained from healthy donors cell mda mb cancer cells were used to assess the viability and propagation of cells in tissue culture after isolation from apostream in independent experiments approximately cancer cells were spiked into buffer and processed through the apostream device at physiological buffer osmolarity of mos the collected cells were counted immediately after isolation and plated in well plates cells well in triplicate for each time point to test their growth potential the cells in well plates were incubated at with co for up to days the cells were harvested using trypsin at time points of and days and viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion method cell adherence to tissue culture plastic surface and propagation were also assessed by examining the cell culture well at each time point with an inverted microscope control cells that were not subject to apostream separation were also cultured for comparison cancer cell isolation the flow and collection of cancer cells and pbmcs through the collection port in the apostream flow chamber was demonstrated in the videos in figures and in these videos the microscope is positioned above the flow chamber over the cell collection port the video in figure demonstrates the flow and collection of cancer cells under an active dep field cancer cells experience positive dep force at an applied frequency greater than the crossover frequency of cancer cells and are drawn to the chamber floor where the flow velocity is lower enabling capture via the collection port the video in figure shows the flow of pbmcs through the apostream flow chamber the first half of the video demonstrates that most pbmcs are pulled into the collection port due to the skimming action generated by the collection pump when the dep field is not active the sample is injected close to the chamber floor under laminar flow conditions to minimize mixing thereby maintaining all cells in the low velocity profile region near the bottom of the chamber the second half of the video from to demonstrates that upon the activation of dep field the pbmcs are repelled from the electrode causing the cells to move into the high velocity flow region and are no longer being collected in the collection port these videos demonstrate dep forces can be used to effectively separate cancer cells from pbmcs in apostream laminar flow microfluidic chamber the apostream device takes min to process approximately pbmcs suspended in ml of sample buffer from ml of whole blood the throughput of the apostream device is faster as compared to other small microfluidic chip based dep technologies study by hu et al showed higher throughput of cells per second which is almost the twice the throughput of apostream device however that technology was limited to cell labeling the apostream device throughput can be further increased by enhancing the flow channel area and increasing the sample injection rate device there are number of operating parameters which potentially affect apostream device performance the eluate sample injection and collection flow rates are inter dependent variables and were balanced to optimize cancer cell levitation cancer cell skimming and throughput processing time also because prior studies indicated that the dep field effectiveness diminishes significantly at distances greater than approximately from the electrode surface flow rates were selected to limit cell levitation to above the chamber floor in addition testing of varying eluate flow rates revealed lower cell collection performance with higher eluate flow rates data not shown these results suggest that the hydrodynamic lift forces begin to dominate with an increase in eluate flow rate and that the cells are driven away from the chamber floor preventing them from being collected through the collection port located in the floor of the flow chamber an increase in the applied voltage from vp to vp significantly decreased the pbmc contamination but did not have significant effect on cancer cell collection data not shown at higher applied voltages the electric field gradients are larger resulting in stronger dep forces as these forces are proportional to the square of field gradient as described in eqs and by increasing the negative dep forces pbmcs are pushed further away from the chamber floor resulting in fewer pbmcs being collected in the collection port however because cancer cell levitation is minimized by precise control of injection and eluate flow rates increasing the applied voltage has minimal impact on cancer cell collection as cancer cells already flow close to the chamber floor over the electrode for collection the doe analysis showed that in the operating ranges tested frequency was the critical factor for cancer cell collection and voltage was the critical factor for pbmc contamination furthermore our analysis has demonstrated that the increase in the collection flow rate resulted in higher cancer cell recovery probably due to an increase in the skimming height data not shown however higher collection flow rates also resulted in an increase in pbmc contamination to demonstrate response to frequency and sample injection flow rate doe was executed and results were analyzed using rsm cancer cell recovery increased with an increase in frequency from khz to khz figure indeed the mean crossover frequency of skov cancer cells was shown to be about khz suggesting that increasing frequency above khz would have resulted in stronger positive dep forces and augmented collection efficiency there was no statistically significant change in pbmc reduction over the khz to khz frequency range tested as these frequencies are well below the average crossover frequencies of pbmcs figure the average percentage reduction in pbmcs after apostream separation was found to be at khz and at khz operating frequency there was no significant change in the recovery with an increase in the sample injection rate within the range tested figure although higher sample injection rates could have resulted in higher cell levitation in the flow chamber the results from the chosen flow chamber configuration demonstrate sufficient travel time was allowed for cells to settle sufficiently to come within the reach of the dep field and become attracted towards the electrode surface eluate and sample buffer optimization studies were performed to further maximize cancer cell recovery statistical analysis of the results indicated that the sample buffer composition was the only significant factor with positive effect on cancer cell recovery as shown in the pareto chart above value limit figure cancer cell recovery improved when using sample buffer with additives compared to no additives or at lower osmolarity eluate buffer figure buffer additives such as bsa pluronic anti oxidant compound and catalase are known to provide either cell membrane stability reduction of oxidative stress or decreased aggregation bsa has been known to reduce the non specific cell surface interactions and is widely used in flow cytometry and microfluidic applications pluronic is stabilizer of cell membranes it reduces potential for membrane shearing by enhancing mechanical strength of the cell membrane with short term exposure it has been shown that hydrogen peroxide is produced when sugar containing buffer is exposed to ac electric fields the addition of catalase to buffer allows hydrogen peroxide decomposition and reduces potential for cell damage these additives were used in the sample buffer to improve the device performance based on their known beneficial effects on cells and ability to increase recovery by lowering non specific adhesion between cell to cell and cell to contact surfaces device cancer cell recovery performance was assessed via systematic precision and linearity spiking studies with different cancer cell lines the intra day and inter day precision results for the enrichment of skov and mda mb cells are shown in table the overall average recovery of tumor cells spiked into approximately pbmcs isolated from ml normal human donor blood was and for skov and mda mb cells respectively both the intra day and inter day precision of the device were less than cv and inter system cv was data not shown the recovery efficiencies are comparable to other dep based devices for cancer cell isolation the efficiency of ovarian cancer cell enrichment was using circular microelectrodes the recovery efficiency of mcf breast cancer cell line from normal breast cells was found to be maximum at using dielectrophoresis activated cell sorter the separation efficiency of mcf cells from red blood cells rbcs and pbmcs was reported as using multi orifice flow fractionation and dep most of these dep microfluidic chip based devices have lower cell throughput compared to apostream device linearity was demonstrated by spiking to skov cells and to mda mb cells into pbmcs obtained from ml normal human donor blood figure the regression equations for linearity were with correlation coefficient of and with of for skov and mda mb cells respectively the recovery performance of the device at lower spiking levels was demonstrated by spiking low numbers of cancer cells into pbmcs and capturing cells with the apostream system the average cancer cell recovery at the lower spiking levels ranging from to cells was as shown in table ii the apostream system was able to enrich and collect cancer cells from as few as cells spiked into pbmcs from ml of normal donor blood the recovery precision and linearity data of the apostream device demonstrate consistent cancer cell recovery performance for both high and low epcam expressing cancer cell types over wide range of spiking levels the reduction in pbmcs after apostream separation was also analyzed the average percentage reduction in pbmcs after apostream separation in the linearity and precision studies reported above was these results compare favorably to other studies the enrichment factor was found to be only fold for the separation of colorectal cancer cells using dep microfluidic chip another dep based study showed white blood cell separation efficiency of only for the isolation of breast cancer cells to demonstrate capability of achieving higher levels of purity with the apostream device additional testing was performed by processing samples through the apostream device twice double enrichment after the first separation run the collected sample was centrifuged at for min and resuspended in the sample buffer the sample was then processed through the apostream device second time after double enrichment the average cancer cell recovery was reduced to cumulative but the percentage reduction in pbmcs increased to as high as the data demonstrated that the pbmc contamination can be reduced significantly through double enrichment of the sample in addition the apostream device provides flexibility by allowing the user to adjust operating parameters to tailor performance to either maximize recovery or maximize purity for example by applying lower operating frequency further away from mean crossover frequencies of pbmcs and lower collection flow rates performance can be adjusted to reduce the pbmc contamination even further cell following isolation and enrichment using the apostream device mda mb cancer cells were cultured and propagated according to standard tissue culture methods figure trypan blue exclusion measurements indicated that cell viability was not affected by the apostream device cell viability was following apostream separation and was maintained at during the day culture period cells showed normal attachment and spreading over the culture plate at day figure and day figure after apostream separation and were comparable to the controls figures and comparable exponential growth was observed figure for apostream isolated cells and control cells no apostream isolation these results are consistent with previous findings indicating that exposure to low frequency electric fields does not cause cell damage we have designed and developed continuous flow dielectrophoretic device for antibody independent high throughput isolation and recovery of viable cancer cells from blood performance characterization of the apostream device demonstrated precision and linearity in the recovery of both high and low epcam expressing cancer cells apostream has the potential to isolate and recover viable cancer cells from all cancer types and enables molecular analysis of the cancer cells the isolation and recovery of cancer cells from blood using apostream represent significant advancement in the field of ctcs enrichment and has been incorporated into numerous ongoing clinical trial studies  in this letter we report that the charge orbital order state of bulk antiferromagnetic sm ca mno is suppressed and confirms the appearance of weak ferromagnetism below followed by low temperature spin glass like transition at in its nano metric counterpart exchange anisotropy effect has been observed in the nano manganites and can be tuned by the strength of the cooling magnetic field hcool the values of exchange fields he coercivity hc remanence asymmetry me and magnetic coercivity mc are found to strongly depend on cooling magnetic field and temperature he increases with increasing hcool but for larger hcool he tends to decrease due to the growth of ferromagnetic cluster size magnetic training effect has also been observed and it has been analyzed thoroughly using spin relaxation model proposed phenomenological core shell type model is attributed to an exchange coupling between the spin glass like shell surrounding and antiferromagnetic core of sm ca mno nano manganites mainly on the basis of uncompensated surface spins results suggest that the intrinsic phase inhomogeneity due to the surface effects of the nanostructured manganites may cause exchange anisotropy which is of special interests for potential application in multifunctional spintronic devices mixed valent manganites have attracted considerable interest due to the discovery of colossal magneto resistance cmr as well as different magnetic sensor and recording devices the complex coupling between the spin charge orbital and lattice degree of freedom leads to host of phenomenon such as metal insulator transition magnetic phase transition nano scale charge and orbital ordering the coupling between ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet can establish directional anisotropy called exchange bias eb which is manifested by shift in the hysteresis loop when the sample is cooled in external magnetic field through the neel temperature of the antiferromagnet in particular the magnetic properties of such nanostructure usually differ from their bulk counterpart due to the surface and size effect the surface actually leads to breaking of sub lattice paring in the antiferromagnet and thus to uncompensate surface spin and the appearance of net magnetic moment due to reduction of the size of the magnetic system the significance of the surface spin increases the conventional exchange bias is observed in fm afm multilayer films or fm nanoparticles embedded in afm matrix the eb effect can be found in different type of system e nanoparticles where cores couple to the shells spin glass sg system where fm domains couple to the antiferromagnetic domain thin film or in double super lattices eb has also been observed in different phase separated manganites and cobalites one of the most fascinating observations was that the charge and orbital ordered antiferromagnetism in bulk manganites are suppressed in their nano particles and nano wires form with appearances of ferromagnetic fm or spin glass sg like phases charge ordered co state is usually observed in half doped manganites with relatively narrow bandwidth system it is known that the antiferromagnetic insulating charge ordered state observed in bulk manganites is suppressed and weak ferromagnetism appears in nano sized manganites tokura et al showed that the robustness of the charge orbital ordering at critically depends on the band width which is understood as competition between the de interaction and the ordering of mn mn ions with ratio accompanied by simultaneous ordering of eg orbital of mn ion in case of sm ca mno the charge orbital ordering is so strong that the critical field becomes as large as about at to melt the charge ordered state two possible scenarios have been envisaged so far in the literature behind these phenomerna the reduction of size introduces an effective hydrostatic pressure modifying the underlying charge and orbital order in the entire grain through enhanced bulk strain and ii the entire effect is primarily driven by surface modifications of the underlying electronic interactions and electronic structure at the nano grains with enhanced grain surface area coupled with the proliferation of disorder and defects in the nano material recently jirak et al shows that the lattice distortion unit cell volume mn distances and octahedral tilts at room temperature pbnm perovskite structure of pr ca mno and la ca mno are practically unaffected by the reduction in grain size all these observations suggest that there are no significant structural reorganizations as the grain size is reduced in the face of the combined evidence the simple minded understanding of the reversal of magnetic and transport properties in the nanometric systems in terms of effective bulk pressures does not seem to work and one has to look for alternatives core shell type phenomenogical model was proposed where the relaxation of the super exchange interaction on the surface of nanoparticles and nanowire allows the formation of fm or spin glass shell ensuing in natural antiferromagnetic afm ferromagnetic fm or ferromagnetic fm sg interface according to monte carlo study of the ce type afm co phase an increase in charge density due to the unscreened coulomb interaction drives the surface spin from an afm co phase to the phase separated state and provide the fm tendency at the surface thus in case of nanosized manganites the surface fm shell coupled with the antiferromagnetic core can be natural structure for exchange bias migration eb effect has been shown in different manganites and cobalties however thorough research investigation on this nanocrystalline manganites sm ca mno is still lacking in this present work we report the suppression of charge ordered state and existence of strong exchange bias in typical nanocrystalline manganites of sm ca mno showing spin glass like behavior this result has important implication for multifunctional nano device applications of manganites based on our detailed magnetic measurements carried out on the samples of sm ca mno with nanograin and bulk counterpart we have critically analyzed all the possible mechanism the nanosized sm ca mno scmo were prepared using chemical route pyrophoric process the high resolution diffraction hrxrd patterns obtained on panalytical high resolution pw diffractometer using cu radiation confirm the single phase nature of the nanoparticles as shown in the fig the hrtem jem and fesem jeol jsm images fig and inset of fig show that we have two samples of average grain size few referred to hereafter as scmobulk and nm scmo respectively the magnetic measurement was carried out using superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer quantum design mpms to investigate the possible structural changes rietveld refinement has been carried out using the high resolution ray diffraction data of the samples at room temperature figure shows rietveld refinement hrxrd of single phase scmo with orthorhombic structure the average particle size estimated using the standard debye scherrer formula eff cos for the most intense peak of scmo sample is found to be nm bright field image of scmo also shows polydisperse whose distribution is given by the histogram fig having average particle size av nm selected area electron diffraction saed pattern of scmo inset of fig shows spotty ring that confirms the single crystalline nature of scmo nanograins the high resolution tem image of single grain single crystalline nature is shown in the fig a typical hrtem image having two different lattice fringes are highlighted in the above figure the distance between two consecutive planes in the fringes is considerably smaller for the core part than that of the shell portion of the particle thorough analysis of their crystallographic structure has been carried out on the basis of high resolution ray hrxrd data all the samples crystallize in orthorhombic structure with pnma space group we observe slight systematic expansion of the unit cell with the decrease of grain size for scmo and for scmobulk if this small expansion has anything to do with the charge ordering at all it will go against the ce type in plane ordering of the orbitals in the y plane this is in accord with our observation of suppression of charge ordering in the nanometric samples the change in unit cell volume is not significant with the change in grain size we also notice that the maximum change in unit cell volume is only for scmo which translates to an insignificant resultant pressure on the grains calculated from the birch murnaghan bm equation of state this implies that there is no significant role of pressure in the nanograins temperature and magnetic field dependent magnetization t measurements of all the samples were carried out using squid magnetometer quantum design mpms from to at field of oe both zfc zero field cooled and fc field cooled measurement of all the samples are shown in the fig the nature of temperature dependence of over the whole range is very different from one another for these nano and bulk samples mainly due to the different kind of magnetic ordering in case of scmobulk complete charge ordering transition temperature is observed at as evident from t magnetization vs temperature nature this typical charge order transition temperature tco consistent with the earlier result charge ordering in scmobulk system is consistent with spin ordering where an antiferromagnetic transition with ce type ordering occurs at neel temperature tn the nearly overlapped zfc and fc curves around confirms the antiferromagnetic ordering strikingly the co transition is not detectable in nanosize scmo sample as shown in the inset of fig clearly showing destabilization of the antiferromagnetic co state below in nanosized grains no visible afm transition can be found in the magnetization curve in case of scmo sample more over the magnetization of the nanoparticle is significantly enhanced below about pointing out the ferromagnetic tendency at low temperature these magnetization behaviors of our nanosized scmo sample concur well with recent observation of other co nano manganites most likely this destabilization predominantly occurs at the magnetically disordered surface of the nano grains showing net moment even below originating presumably from the unsaturated super exchange as well as enhanced double exchange de interactions at the surface region these surface modifications are weakened gradually towards the core of the grain stabilizing the afm order in the core moreover the drop of zfc magnetization with the decrease of temperature at the low temperature regime and strong irreversibility between zfc and fc magnetization curves for this nanometric sample demonstrates the signature of strong anisotropy disorder in the system when the grain size of system is reduced the grain surface region is enhanced compared to core of the grain mainly due to enhanced surface to volume ratio at the grain surface due to the presence of large number of defects the antiferromagnetic order is disturbed and uncompensated spins will be present there increase of the net moment of the grain due to the destabilization of the antiferromagnetic order at the surface in the nanometric systems is the cause of the broad nature of the t curve around the charge order transition there is high probability that short ranged ferromagnetic order will develop at the surface below the charge order transition and the ferromagnetic region will coexist with antiferromagnetic regions the so called phase separation may occur at the surface region however the magnetic nature of the core of the grains in the nanoparticles cannot be conclusively determined with any bulk measurement technique like dc magnetization etc it is also understandable that at the surface area the spins will be strongly pinned at the different pinning sites defect sites giving rise to strong anisotropy the strong anisotropic behavior is reflected in the irreversibility in the fc zfc magnetization of the nanometric samples so the large difference between the zfc and fc curve over broad temperature range indicates the spin glass like behavior as evident from the minima of dm dt of scmo as shown in the inset of fig thus the sample scmo shows clear spin glass like transition at to confirm the low temperature glassy state in scmo sample we have measured the temperature dependent linear and non linear ac susceptibility at selective frequencies with and hz in an ac field of oe temperature dependent real and imaginary part are shown in the fig and in the inset of fig the peak shifts to higher temperature with increasing measuring frequency such behavior is signature of glassy state at first we employ the thermal activation model and analyze the low temperature frequency dependent transition using the arrhenius law exp ea kbt here ea is the activation energy and tf is the temperature corresponding to the maxima in in the low temperature regime is taken as the experimental time scale we first note that the variation of tf is not linear with as evident from the inset of fig to verify the arhenius law we have plotted ln vs tf here the linear best fit result provides the unrealistic value of and ea so we can rule out the possibility of any thermally activated process and the possibility of superparamagnetic blocking at this temperature regime the frequency dependence shift of the peak in i tf tf log is found to be the value of tf tf log for the metallic canonical spin glass system varies from and for insulating sg system so the result clearly suggests that the system scmo behaves more like metallic spin glass state rather than cluster glass state in case of spin glass system the frequency dependence is very often analyzed by employing the dynamic scaling law of the form tf tg where is the spin relaxation time is the critical exponent and tg is the spin glass transition temperature tg is equivalent to the freezing temperature of spin glass in the limit of zero frequency the best fit from by dynamical scaling shown in the fig produces the value of tg which is nearly equal to the dc value found from the temperature dependent dc magnetization inset of fig the values of and are and respectively the value of holds satisfactory as generally observed in canonical sg system in the range for conventional spin glass system typical value of is of the order of moreover we observe shift in magnetic hysteresis loop while the scmo sample was cooled in static dc magnetic field the shift is absent while the cooling field is almost zero as shown in the inset of fig the asymmetric magnetic hysteresis loop shifts in both field and magnetization axes which indicate the existence of exchange bias eb phenomena shown in the fig the eb field he and hc are generally defined as h and h where and are left and right coercive field the remanence asymmetry me and the magnetic coercivity mc are defined as me mr mr and mc mr mr mr and mr are the positive and negative remanant magnetization respectively one of the important characteristics in the exchange bias system is the magnetic training effect which describes the reduction of exchange bias field he and exchange bias magnetization me when the sample is continuously field cycled for this sample the continuous hysteresis loops were measured after the fc at koe down to from tf and the measuring field range is koe the dependence of exchange bias field he and exchange bias magnetization me with the number of field cycles is shown in the fig the value of he and me decreases with increasing the field cycles which is in accordance with the reported results the relation between the he me and can be best fitted by simple power law e e infty alpha sqrt he he where he is the eb field at the solid red line in the fig shows the best fitting result for the fitting parameters are obtained to be he oe and me emu gm respectively however the above equation holds only for and can not explain the steep relaxation for binek recently proposed relaxation model deducing recursive formula with dependence of he me the relation is given by documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation e h n gamma e h infty end equation end document he he he he where is sample dependent constant using and prime infty he oe the theoretical values of he solid circle in fig are calculated using eq similarly we have calculated the theoretical value of me solid triangle in fig it is remarkable that the theoretical results are well accordant with the experimental results not only for but also for thus the spin configurationally relaxation model can describe our experimental results very well to reveal the origin of exchange bias effect in this mixed valent manganites the temperature dependence exchange bias parameter has also been studied in this case the sample was cooled from the room temperature to the desired temperature with an applied magnetic field koe once the measuring temperature was reached the magnetization loop was measured between and koe from which he and me were calculated as shown in the fig for scmo the value of he and me decreases sharply and vanishes at the freezing temperature tf the temperature evolution of he is typical for exchange bias system as the sample is cooled through tn with an applied magnetic field the exchange interaction between the afm phase core and disordered fm phase induces an interface magnetic moment on the antiferromagnet which remains frozen at low temperature sequentially below the freezing temperature tf tn the pinned or frozen spins provides the necessary pinning force to derive the ferromagnet back to positive remanence on the recoil curve thus the eb effect observed through the unidirectional shift of the hysteresis loops is induced by the interface exchange coupling between the disordered fm sg domains and the co afm background again the sg phase can not induce the frozen fm spins above the freezing temperature resulting he the value of me also increases more than one order of magnitude below tf due to enhancement of the magnetic irreversibility induced by the freezing of the spin glass region the existence of low temperature tf spin glass freezing has also been observed in other system and has also been attributed to spin glass like phases occurring in uncompensated spin disordered surface around the ordered particles inset of fig and shows the cooling field dependence of exchange bias parameter he hc me and mc at for scmo sample all the above parameters increase sharply up to field of koe at the higher cooling field me tends to saturate but he decreases with increasing the cooling field ms is the saturation magnetization determined using the extrapolation of high field magnetization at me ms is found to increase with he the decrease in he is accompanied with increase in mc this suggests that the growth of fm cluster at high cooling field could contribute partly to the decay of he consequently at the high cooling field not only the alignment of degree of fm cluster increases but the size of fm cluster also increases so eb value reduces due to enhancement of size of fm cluster according to bean relation in case of fm afm thin films the exchange bias field is inversely proportional to the fm layer thickness the relation is given by documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation e ex frac afm fm mu fm fm end equation end document he jexsafmsfm tfmmfm jex is the exchange constant across the fm afm interface per unit area sfm and safm are the interface ferromagnet and antiferromagnet magnetization tfm and mfm are the thickness and magnetization of the fm layer so for the strong cooling fields fm clusters become very large so sfm and safm decrease and tfm increase which decrease he with increase of cooling magnetic field hcool due to the glassy behavior of surface spin at low temperature regime including eb response niebieskikwiat and salamon have shown that the hcool depends on he by the following relation documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation e alpha frac e s alpha i left frac i mu left mu right left frac mu cool b f right cool right end equation end document he mems jiji b hcoolkbtf hcool where x is the langevin function kb is the boltzmann constant and nv in fig the red color solid line corresponds to fit of eq with an overall scale factor considering ji and nv are the adjustable parameter from this equation the competition between the exchange interaction and the cooling field becomes evident at low cooling field the first term dominates and depends on ji however for large cooling fields the second term ji becomes important and for ji the absolute value of he would decrease or even more he can change its sign the exchange constant determined from the best fit of the experimental result shows negative ji this indicates an afm coupling between the fm domains and the afm host explaining the tendency of me ms towards reduction at high hcool so with increasing hcool the magnetic coupling zeeman coupling between the spin of fm cluster and non fm matrix at the interface increases as well tending to orient them along the field direction all these features of magnetic properties in the nanosized samples which are almost universal across different co manganites could be accounted from our proposed phenomenological picture core shell structure based on the surface disorder in the nanograins we have attempted to explain all the observed results on nanometric samples through destabilization of co and surface disorder at the shell of the nano grains schematic drawing of the structure is shown in the fig thus the eb effect can be expected based on the fact that there exists coupling between the sg shell and the afm core in the sample where the sg shell acts as fm component in case of eb parameter low cooling field causes the spins of the sg shell to align partially along the external field inducing the enhancement of unidirectional exchange interaction between the afm core and the sg shell this will contribute to the increase in he and me for strong enough cooling field the spins of almost all sg shell align along the cooling field and the interaction between the afm core and the sg shell approaches the maximum and hence he and me tend to saturate thus disordered shell with gradually ordered core region with the surface effect or the proportion of shell thickness increases as the size of the grain decreases we emphasize the fact that there is gradual change in the magnetic order from the center to the boundary of these grains at certain grain size the ferromagnetic shells of the nearby grains form conducting path due to sufficient overlap of the electrons via double exchange leading to gradual onset of fm sg behavior in the scmo the nature of the states in the core region does not interfere in such transport evidently in summary the robust charge ordering in bulk sm ca mno is weakened in nano scmo accompanied with the emergence of spin glass like phase with ferromagnetic state in case of scmo nanoparticle the destabilization of co at this stage is primarily attributed to the surface reconstruction of the electronic states and the consequent renormalization of magnetic exchange this destabilization of afm co state enhances the double exchange mechanism and consequent fm tendencies as well frequency dependent ac susceptibility clearly suggests the spin glass like transition at in the nanometric form furthermore after cooling the sample through the neel temperature with an applied static magnetic field this manganite nanoparticles exhibits that the exchange bias effect can be effectively tuned by the cooling field which has very useful role for multifunctional application the temperature dependence exchange bias parameter also suggest that the pinned or frozen disordered fm sg spins give rise to the unidirectional shift of the magnetic hysteresis loops the exchange bias effect reveals magnetic training effect which can be described very well by spin relaxation model our phenomenological hypothesis core shell model is clearly very general and explains qualitatively the exchange bias effects in charge ordering destabilized scmo manganites nanoparticles  we present photoelectron photoion coincidence pepico spectrometer named delicious ii which combines velocity map imaging apparatus with wiley mclaren time of flight analyzer for the study of gas phase samples in interaction with the synchrotron radiation sr this versatile system is capable of providing photoelectron images on mass selected compounds with kinetic energy resolutions of e and ev bandwidth as well as threshold photoelectron spectra with measured resolution of mev as demonstrated on the ionization of argon this instrument is also employed for threshold pepico experiments allowing the selection of the parent ion internal state with sub mev resolution for light masses amu and with typically mev resolution for mass of amu and with mass resolving power above the continuous operation of the extraction fields and the independence from the electron time of flight are well adapted to the quasicontinuous multibunch mode of the sr this together with the high transmission of both the electron and ion detection allows high coincidence counting rate and facilitates the subtraction of false coincidences we illustrate the spectrometer coincidence principle of operation with examples from the valence photoionization of an ar xe mixture and of cf gas phase photoionization is basic photon matter process widely encountered in nature interstellar medium planetary ionosphere whose study in the laboratory by photoelectron spectroscopy pes has made considerable progresses with the availability during the past decades of intense short wavelength light sources such as vacuum ultraviolet vuv lasers and synchrotron radiation sr pes can either be performed at fixed photon energies with dispersive analyzer electrostatic or by time of flight tof or when tunable light source is employed by collecting threshold electrons also referred to as zero electron kinetic energy zeke as function of the ionizing photon energy the latter directly provides by energy conservation the spectroscopy of the cation electronic structure and defines the principle of threshold photoelectron spectroscopy tpes tpes has usually very high collection efficiency and potentially high resolution but lacks any angular resolution and is not adapted to the study of resonant features such as the decay of autoionizing states therefore the use of conventional pes versus tpes depends on the scientific needs because of energy and momentum conservation single photoionization of atoms can be fully characterized by pes alone the molecular case is more complex since in addition to the internal degrees of freedom in which the energy of the incoming photon can be stored such as electronic and or rovibrational excitation of the resulting ion part of the energy can also be transferred into translational energy of the cation fragments produced in photodissociation events in order to fully characterize the energy and momentum sharing between the electron and the different ionic fragments several photoelectron photoion coincidence pepico schemes have been developed taking simultaneous advantage of pes ion momentum and or mass spectrometry ms sometimes involving the detection of several electron and or several ions in the case of multiple ionization and core ionization npempico in the case of valence shell vuv photoionization on which we are focusing as from now dissociative ionization has been studied in terms of spectroscopy energetics and thermochemistry via threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence tpepico experiments providing dissociation limits and appearance energies kinetic energy releases kers from state selected ion heats of formation fragmentation breakdown diagrams of state selected parent ions as well as ionization energies of radicals note that the tpepico method can also be used in the context of bimolecular state selected ion neutral reactivity dissociative ionization has also been studied in terms of molecular photoionization and fragmentation dynamics by the study of angle resolved momentum electron ion correlations on the other hand imaging techniques initially introduced by the laser community in which the original three dimensional electron or ion velocity distribution is projected onto two dimensional position sensitive detector psd allowing multiplex and simultaneous measurement of both the radial and angular distributions have become widely used and powerful tool in the general field of molecular dynamics this has been especially the case since the introduction of the velocity map imaging vmi concept by eppink and parker in which the presence of inhomogeneous electric fields producing lensing effect gives rise to spectacular deblurring of the images and hence to considerable improvement in energy resolution note that the vmi technique by its ability to provide crisp images quite regardless of the size of the source volume is especially well suited for sr based studies often associated with large source volumes so that several of these instruments either used for electron or ion imaging are being used throughout sr centers the combination of these imaging techniques with electron ion coincidence schemes appears therefore as powerful tool for the study of molecular photoionization and it has been applied for instance to the study of vectorial correlations in dissociative ionization in this paper we wish to present versatile and universal electron ion coincidence imaging spectrometer called delicious ii able to perform both tpepico and angle resolved pepico ar pepico such spectrometer has been conceived to be inserted into the saphirs molecular beam mb chamber permanent end station of the desirs vuv beamline of the french third generation synchrotron center soleil desirs is an undulator based beamline covering the ev range with variable polarization and very high spectral resolution its scientific case is manifold including the study of unimolecular reactions such as molecular cation fragmentation as well the dynamics of photoionization of atomic and molecular samples the need for versatility of delicious ii is twofold first by having single apparatus to perform most of the scientific case with the saphirs chamber one saves the time invested in the switching aligning and testing of different setups in between two users beam time second it allows to perform on the very same sample different and complementary types of spectroscopy for instance tpes followed by ar pepico in practice delicious ii is aimed at replacing the former tpepico spectrometer of saphirs in which the selection of threshold electrons was done by both steradiancy aperture as well as by the measurement of electron tof with respect to the sr light pulse the drawback of such an approach is the limited resolution due to uncertainty in the tof measurement in the mev range and the need for the time structure operation of the sr ring mode of operation which is not very often scheduled on third generation storage rings and which suffers from severe flux reduction with respect to the multibunch mode typically factor of because of the limited electron current that can be stored in single or in few electron bunches delicious ii will also be an upgrade of delicious sr optimized vmi spectrometer in the sense that delicious ii allows the operation of vmi on electron ion in coincidences with ions electrons note that vmi ion has already been implemented in coincidence with electrons not analyzed and that photoelectron velocity mapped images have also been recorded previously in coincidence with vmi ions although the obtained ion mass resolution is not sufficient to fulfill the beamline scientific case delicious ii consists of combining in tandem geometry an electron or ion vmi delicious with wiley mclaren tof wm tof spectrometer its specifications are the following operate in fully continuous cw operation e with an optimal duty cycle matching the natural sr operation in the multibunch mode as well as with the cw mb of saphirs in particular avoid any pulsed electric field for both noise issues on the detector and to avoid the cumbersome subtraction of random coincidences keep all the performances in both the electron and the ion modes achieved by the vmi delicious alone ion imaging that we mostly use as very fine probe of the nozzle to skimmer positioning electron imaging with an optimized resolving power of ref and with collection efficiency up to ev that has been mainly applied so far to the study of photoelectron circular dichroism on pure enantiomers of gas phase chiral molecules perform tpes with the highest possible spectral resolution at least sub mev taking advantage of the broad and easy tunability of sr and of the very high spectral resolution achieved by the desirs beamline providing on large spectral range the spectroscopy of the ion states with rovibrational resolution perform tpepico by collecting and mass analyzing the coincident ion the so called mass analyzed threshold ion in order on one hand to study the fragmentation of energy selected cations and derive the thermochemical associated data appearance energy heats of formation etc and on the other hand to be able to perform tpes on mass selected parent ions this is extremely useful when one deals with nonpure mb which is commonly the case of radicals produced by pyrolysis or photolysis leading sometimes to mixture of the radical to be studied and of its precursor perform ar pepico with high resolution on the electron side in relative kinetic energy and mass resolution above e m and with high counting rate typically above events sec in order to acquire high quality images and to take advantage of the high flux of the beamline this would allow for instance to perform ar pes on mass selected clusters and also it would strongly enhance even in the case of monomers the performances of the vmi in electron mode by suppressing any unwanted contribution to the electron image by simple filtering with the coincident ion peak in the mass spectrum one could remove any electron contribution from scattered light background gas carrier gas of the jet nonpure jet of radicals etc note that by considering all the electrons regardless of their momentum one simply gets the mass spectrum of the molecules present in the jet which is very fine probe of contamination or thermal decomposition in the case of heated sample note also that coincidence spectrometers based on the direct full measurement of electron and ion momenta by dual imaging and tof technique are capable of covering broader scientific program than the present ar pepico apparatus in particular they can extract molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions but would not fulfill our requirements because of their limited electron energy resolution especially for fast electrons and or their need for pulsed light source sr in the time structure mode or pulsed laser perform mass resolved ion imaging for the study of cluster fragmentation for example by operating the vmi in the ion mode and using the coincident electron detected on the tof side as start for the ms analysis in sec ii we will describe the delicious ii spectrometer and its environment saphirs mb chamber sr beamline desirs then the tpes mode of operation followed by one of the wm tof will be presented from the conception to the performances in sec the coincidence modes pepico and tpepico will be exposed illustrated and discussed future prospects will be given in sec vi vmi spectrometer reconstructs the original newton sphere without the need of the time coordinate while this is advantageous for continuous light sources one of the inconveniences is that the reconstruction must be performed posteriori since the method needs complete image to work thus contrary to an imaging spectrometer one cannot determine the particles velocity vector by examining single impact on the detector the above statement removes some of the interests of building coincidence setup where two vmi are coupled together since only coincidences with particles corresponding to the largest radius would be possible more suitable and versatile alternative is to couple vmi with spectrometer capable of resolving single event so that filtering of the events on an image can be done prior to its inversion one of the simplest options fulfilling our scientific interests is wm tof spectrometer d schematic of the apparatus presented in this article is shown in fig the vmi part has already been described in detail in previous article the only difference being the aperture plus grid on the repeller plate to sweep the ions through the wm tof consists of two acceleration regions to obtain the space focusing condition for any voltage applied on the extraction plates the wm tof energy focusing condition depends solely on the turn around time of the ions which is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the extraction field therefore for tpepico experiments involving high and closely spaced fragment masses compromise must be reached between mass resolution and fast electron discrimination as we will see in sec iii the combination of imaging techniques with coincidence schemes imposes severe constraints into the type of psd to be used since each single event should be recorded and read one by one in our case where the ion tof can be as low as few microseconds depending on the extraction voltages the electron detector should be able to record events at frequency superior to khz in order to take advantage of the possible high counting rates reachable with high flux beamline this prevents the use of low repetition rate reading detector such as the widely used charge coupled device based camera detector which would limit the acquisition rate to few tens of hertz routinely and in the best case to khz the psd mounted on the present vmi has been the subject of publication briefly it is based on delay line anode capable of obtaining absolute spatial resolutions better than over the mm diameter of the microchannel plates mcps with dead time below ns mhz the electron ion coincidence electronic scheme is shown in fig the much faster electron arrives few tens of nanoseconds after being produced and triggers the internal clock of ctnm multistop time to digital converter tdc designed at the institut de physique nucl aire orsay france the electron arrival also opens hardware window during which further starts are inhibited all the stops four for the electron position and one for the ion tof are recorded with time resolution of ps the inhibition window width is chosen according to the maximum expected ion tof typically in the after the window closes the tdc will accept another start and the process will be repeated the tdc is interfaced to personal computer which examines the raw data to generate the electron detector coordinates from the delay anode time signals and the ion tof from the wm tof detector for each coincidence event there exists also the possibility of performing mass selected ion imaging where the extraction directions of the electrons and ions are exchanged much as has been already done by rolles et al in this case both the ion tof and ion position come from the vmi while the wm tof only gives the start signal to the tdc however this mode would be detrimental to the mass resolution since the space focusing is lost higher mass resolutions have been achieved in ion velocity mapping albeit at the expense of complicated setup involving the addition of reflectron the delicious ii spectrometer is magnetically shielded by two layers of metal and installed vertically inside the saphirs mb chamber as compared to the original design this chamber has been recently upgraded with new frame allowing precise positioning of the chamber geometrical center with respect to the photon axis in addition new motor controlled xyz translation stage has been implemented so that very accurate tuning of the nozzle position with respect to the skimmer can be achieved such critical adjustment is performed in the ion imaging mode to optimize the cold to thermal contribution in the jet and ensure an optimum transverse alignment of the nozzle with respect to the skimmer and to the vmi main axis the photon source is provided by the vuv synchrotron beamline called desirs located at the french synchrotron facility soleil this undulator based beamline provides easy tunability and variable polarization of the photons in the ev range with high photon flux on the sample in the ph range for bandwidth and measured resolving power of up to at ev and at ev owing to m normal incidence monochromator the beamline is ideally suited for tpes and tpepico pepico studies this includes ar pes and ar pepico studies which can benefit from the quick and easy change in polarization for instance from linear vertical to horizontal or to circular avoiding the need for cumbersome rotation of the spectrometer around the photon axis furthermore desirs offers high spectral purity due to the upstream presence of windowless gas filter which attenuates undulator high harmonics photons that can be transmitted by the grating higher order by factor of up to the latter is of paramount importance for photoionization studies occurring at relatively low energies since higher order photons would produce fast electron background on the images plus spurious ion fragmentation that would strongly impair the reliability of the data the skimmed mb is crossed with the photon beam at right angles defining the ionization volume in the center of the vmi installed in the ionization chamber the distance between the skimmer and the vmi axis is cm we estimate the mb length at this level to be in the mm range depending on the skimmer used defining the ionization source dimension along the sr axis because of the low emittance of soleil the sr beam transverse dimensions at the focal point are quite small typically horizontal vertical these values set the transverse size of the ionization source volume note that if very high flux is needed for the study of extremely diluted targets we would open the monochromator exit slit by up to in which case the slit aperture dominates and gives the vertical size of the focal point up to despite the large variety of applications of classical pes limitations of this technique appear when high electron resolution is required since in general typical resolutions associated with pes lie in the mev range sometimes down to few mev furthermore the collection efficiency of electrons with electrostatic analyzers is often poor in pes which may lead to difficulties in obtaining spectra with acceptable signal to noise ratios as well as preclude efficient experiments performed in coincidence with the corresponding ions because of the high level of false coincidences to overcome these problems the tpes approach was introduced few decades ago especially for valence shell single ionization studies tpes consists of the selection and detection of only electrons having kinetic energies close to zero the spectroscopy of the ion state being obtained by scanning the photon energy in this context different experimental approaches have been developed the most commonly employed for sr studies being the tpe detection based on tof discrimination the penetrating field and pulsed field ionization pfi these methods have enabled to achieve resolutions of and ref mev respectively note that by combining the pfi and the tof discrimination jarvis et al obtained tpes resolution down to mev on ar improvement of these methods is still possible since in theory detection of tpes can be performed with spectral resolution limited only by the bandwidth of the ionization radiation nevertheless detection based on tof requires light pulses separated with large time intervals considerably reducing its application in third generation synchrotron sources mostly operating in multibunch mode pfi tpes in its most refined mode coupled with ion detection for tpepico ref requires the use of either the few bunch modes or hybrid mode with long dark period which is not available on many sr centers and is performed to the detriment of mass resolution and with an increased complexity in sztaray and baer introduced an original concept of tpe selection in which velocity focusing optics are used to suppress hot electrons more precisely the detector mounted on their spectrometer employed two discrete anodes central one to collect the slowest electrons arriving in the middle of the detector together with background of fast electrons and an outer ring to collect only the fast electrons the tpe contribution is then derived by subtraction renormalization of one signal versus the other this method has the great advantage of operating in fully continuous mode well adapted to cw light sources and for which coincidence tpepico treatment is straightforward the tpe selection principle introduced in the present paper represents major improvement upon the setup of sztaray and baer it consists of replacing the central and ring anodes by psd providing the full imaging capabilities associated with vmi techniques due to the electrostatic lens created in the vmi extraction region photoelectrons produced during the ionization process impact the psd at positions which vary according only to their velocities slow electrons are focused on the center of the image whereas faster electrons are spread onto much larger area around the central spot the maximum radius of the impact pattern of photoelectrons with kinetic energy is related to the voltage applied on the repeller electrode vrep according tor ce vrep where is coefficient dependant on the geometry of the vmi and is the electron charge this relation shows that photoelectrons are more spread when low repeller voltage is applied consequently to discriminate fast electrons from zeke and thus increase the energy resolution the setup should be operated with the lowest possible repeller voltage in practice however the smallest repeller value will be limited by stray magnetic and electric fields and possible electrostatic aberrations as shown further down in this section threshold electrons are obtained with the same method proposed by sztaray and baer except that the discrete anodes are now replaced with virtual image regions meaning that the position and area of these circular regions can be chosen posteriori this approach is illustrated in fig where close up of photoelectron image of ar integrated in the photon energy range ev is shown at this energy nearly all the electrons correspond to the threshold since the level would give mev electrons which are strongly discriminated by the low repeller voltage the central region marked in fig corresponds to diameter of mm over the total mm diameter of the detector while the outer ring or crown is fixed to the central region and has an external diameter of mm the signal obtained from the crown provides an evaluation of the hot electron contribution assuming constant contribution of the hot electrons to the crown and center simple renormalization by the area of the two regions and subtraction provides therefore pure threshold photoelectron signal however when the kinetic energy of the hot electrons is close to the radial position of the crown as obtained from eq the contribution of the energetic electrons to the crown and center is no longer constant and has to be taken into account by an empirical factor the subtraction then takes the shapetpes centeracenter fcrownacrown where represents the area of either the central or the crown zones on the psd since the factor depends on the form of the tpes and on the angular distribution of the hot electrons the normalization factor will vary for each studied system and with the photon energy for very large scans in practice an optimum factor can be automatically found as the highest value for which the baseline is positive experimentally this optimum factor varies between and the tpes of the ar threshold obtained in the ev energy region is given as an illustration of the subtraction method in fig the center and crown raw spectra obtained by selecting the regions of fig are plotted along with the subtracted result the center spectrum shows tail due to the hot electron contribution to the central region to reduce this hot electron tail the signal corresponding to the crown region is subtracted with correction factor of the resulting tpes is then free of almost all hot electron contributions as can be seen in fig in order to show the high energy resolution capability of the method as well as the long term signal to noise ratio and stability we present in fig the tpes obtained for the two first ionization thresholds of argon in the ev energy range with mev steps and using repeller voltage of and center and crown diameters of and mm respectively the measured energy resolution full width at half maximum reached is of mev for both thresholds this spectrum was taken with the gr mm monochromator grating and slits corresponding to photon resolving power of each point was accumulated during note that this resolution of mev is obtained in the full tpepico mode e by detecting in coincidence the tpe with the corresponding mass selected ion the corresponding total ion yield spectrum recorded simultaneously shows the ns and nd rydberg autoionizing series converging toward the limit with slit limited resolution mev these resonances decaying via autoionization and producing fast electrons are totally suppressed in the tpes spectrum which only shows the two ionic states of ar except for tiny contribution from the exceptionally intense rydberg state around ev on the resonances the total electron count rate exceeded cps counts per second while count rates within the central and crown regions reached up to and cps respectively it should be noted that when performing tpes with vmi spectrometer attention has to be paid to detector saturation since threshold electrons arrive within small area of the detector at the moment of writing the mcps mounted on the detector have pore separation and mm thickness because each channel within the mcp has dead time of few tens of milliseconds and in the example shown in fig the central region encircles only channels the maximum count rate in the center will be limited to few thousands cps however we expect the dead time to decrease with the density of channels so that future improvement in maximum count rate will be achieved by installing thinner mcps with shorter pore to pore distance and lower resistance the performance of the vmi spectrometer in the threshold mode is more generally characterized in fig where the dependence of the energy resolution with the repeller voltage and the central and crown region size is described as already discussed earlier the resolution is improved for lower repeller voltages because the fast electrons are more efficiently dispersed for instance for fixed size of center mm and crown mm diameters the resolution degrades from to mev when increasing the repeller from to this result however disagrees with the theoretical predictions since the energy resolution should be proportional to the repeller this can be explained by the importance of stray fields at very low repellers from the curves we can state that the resolution is indeed proportional to the repeller when its value is above repeller voltages under this value will begin to saturate the resolution ray tracing simulations predict dependence on for the threshold electron energy resolution and for fixed crown region of the form a br where is an offset limiting the lowest possible resolution due to the finite size of the source and depends linearly on the repeller voltage the experimental curves plotted in fig follow the theoretical trend although the absolute values differ slightly as noted in table where the theoretical values are written alongside the experimental results by looking at the table we can conclude that the agreement is worst for the small repeller values and central regions which can be explained by penetrating and stray fields mechanical defects producing electrostatic aberrations or an interaction region larger than expected due to its simplicity the tpes method presented here can be applied straightforwardly to any vmi spectrometer with psd detector the resolution has been improved with respect to the original experimental setup of sztaray and baer partly because the imaging capabilities allow greater flexibility on the selection of the central and crown regions which means that we can adjust the position and size to find the optimum subtraction this is of critical importance when applying very low values on the repeller where the center of the image can move due to stray fields or mechanical misalignments furthermore by decreasing the size of the central area it is possible to keep reasonably high electron resolution while having high extraction fields and therefore high mass resolution see sec iv in this sense the psd provides great versatility in the optimization of the compromise between electron energy resolution and mass resolution of the corresponding ion in the context of tpepico experiments in addition this flexibility allows for given repeller voltage to tune the trade off between electron resolution and the signal level in comparison with the pfi tpepico setup as developed at the advanced light source our system is able to reach similar ultimate electron energy resolution with fully continuous and simple system without the need for complex pulse shaping electronics necessary to optimize the pfi process and without the trouble of treating false coincidence in pulsed regime in addition as already pointed out by sztaray and baer the focusing optic tpe selection is compatible with the presence of high extraction fields which may be necessary for optimum mass resolution on the ion side to the detriment of electron energy resolution compromise that cannot be found with the pfi tpepico method in which the average extraction field is rather low to ensure correct pfi process the performances of the wm spectrometer are already well described analytically in our case the light source dimension along the spectrometer axis defines the incertitude on the ion creation dimension around the point source where is the distance from the ionization source to the repeller plate this dimension depends on the aperture of the monochromator exit slit and typically varies between and assuming the largest aperture the mass resolution obtained for ions with no initial kinetic energy under the space focusing condition dtof ds is s amu for particles having an initial kinetic energy including thermal energy the mass resolution depends on the time it takes for an ion ejected opposite to the detector direction to double back e tr tr s qvrep where vext vrep and vext vrep is the voltage applied to the extractor repeller electrode the expression illustrates the natural compromise between the electron and mass resolutions when operating in coincidence mode with threshold electrons see sec iii the analytical expectations need to be compared to our actual design indeed due to the gridless design of the extractor plate the electric field is not homogeneous and varies along the spectrometer axis as well as on the plane perpendicular to this direction owing to the mb diameter at the ionization region the cigar shaped volume source presents the largest dimension along the sr direction ions created along this direction will be submitted to different focusing conditions which will translate in an asymmetry on the tof peak shape electrostatic simulations demonstrate that the electric field can decrease by few percent along the sr axis which causes tail toward longer tofs to appear this effect is illustrated in fig where mass spectrum of xe recorded for vrep is presented the top graph shows the ion tof obtained under vmi conditions while in the bottom one the extractor voltage has been lowered to diminish the lens effect at the ionization point clearly the asymmetric shape observed in fig is related to the inhomogeneous electric field created by the gridless design furthermore the electric field is globally increased in the direction of the spectrometer axis due to the potential isocurves leaking through the gridless electrodes therefore to compensate for this effect the expected ratio between the first and second acceleration regions of the wm has to be increased by factor of the mass resolution calculated by applying the wm expressions to the conditions stated in fig is mr amu this value is derived assuming the velocity distribution found in mb cooled at and represents the maximum mass for which we should resolve mr and mr by studying fig we can conclude that the inhomogeneous field does not degrade significantly the mass resolution even if the tof peaks are distorted since all the xe isotopes around z are clearly separated from adjacent masses we can also express the resolution in terms of mass or time resolving power and for the case described in fig under vmi conditions we obtain mfwhm tm tfwhm for the peak at amu this example illustrates the ability of our spectrometer to reach satisfactory mass resolutions even for relatively low repeller voltage whereas as seen in sec iii keeping an electron resolution of few mev the narrower transverse speed distribution obtained in the mb due to the cooling process contributes to increase further the mass separation of the parent ions if one is only interested in purely mass spectroscopic studies without the need for selecting the electron energy the ratio could be diminished to eliminate the asymmetric tof shape and increase the mass resolution another important aspect of the wm tof which also imposes lower limit on vrep in coincidence mode is the ion transmission since the mb is propagating perpendicular to the spectrometer axis the ions need to be accelerated enough perpendicularly to their initial momentum to cross through the electrodes and reach the psd geometrical constraints on the saphirs chamber prevented us from increasing the electrode internal radii so that even with the addition of deflectors we are limited to the detection of light masses at low repeller voltages with our current geometry the lower limit for the ion masses to achieve collection of the ions can be expressed via the basic application of dynamics laws as function of the repeller using the expression z limit vrepvjet where the mass is given in amu the repeller in volts and vjet is the mb velocity in sec for instance lowering the repeller voltage to will limit our detection to masses under amu when using supersonic ar seeded beam cooled at due to the high speed s along the mb direction the use of on the repeller would raise the mass limit up to amu which is enough for most of our applications and corresponds to typical electron energy resolution of mev very satisfactory in the case of large organic molecules there are two main approaches when performing coincidences with delicious ii the first one consists of recording photoelectron images of given ion mass pepico this is illustrated in fig where the photoelectron image shown corresponds to the photoionization of mixture of ar and xe at photon energy of ev this energy is above the first and ionization potentials of ar and xe respectively four rings can be discerned two for each atom corresponding to the and states of the ion figure also shows the ion tof obtained in coincidence with the electron image where two groups of peaks corresponding to the ar and xe masses can be observed including the different xe isotopes the electron image and the ion tof have been acquired during less than min with respective counting rate of and khz out of the events per second read by the tdc only was accepted as true coincidences while the rest was rejected due to electron position or ion missing from the event by selecting the ionization events corresponding to given mass range we can obtain photoelectron images for the individual species present in the mb as demonstrated in figs and for the ar and xe peaks respectively the photoelectron images are subsequently treated by applying the pbasex algorithm to extract slice of the original sphere after the image inversion the generation of the pes and angular parameters is straightforward as it can be seen in figs and the ion filtering of the electron images leads to clean pes without any background coming from scattered light or from residual gases as stated in our previous work the relative kinetic energy resolution depends on the ratio between initial kinetic energy and the repeller voltage for this particular example the resolution varies between at the lowest ratio ar and at the highest ratio xe this figure could probably be even lowered by slightly lowering the repeller voltage so that the corresponding outer ring would approach the edge of the psd the energy resolution has been perceptively improved with respect to the previous publication probably due to the smaller beam size provided by the desirs beamline the resolution achieved with delicious ii shows its clear advantage over imaging detectors whose electron energy resolution depends on the tof and which is typically limited to few tens of percent as soon as the kinetic energy of the electron is above ev or so although recent advances in timing electronics have allowed imaging analyzers to attain resolutions of few percent they are still limited to relatively slow electrons and need to pulse the extraction field to elongate the electron tof in addition they require pulsed light source with very short pulse duration which cannot be achieved on third generation sr sources where pulse durations even in the time structure mode are in general of the order of ps for one photon direct ionization with linearly polarized light the angular distribution of electrons ejected from randomly oriented sample is fully characterized in the laboratory frame by the well known parameter the measured angular parameters for the four orbitals probed figs and are in good agreement with previous experimental results on rare gases showing that delicious ii is well suited for ar pes on mass selected samples the second approach consists of performing coincidences with threshold electrons to select the ion internal state scanning the photon energy while fixing the kinetic energy of the electron to zero permits the study of the energetics and fragmentation pathways as function of the ion internal energy as an example we have recorded tpepico spectra of the cf molecule over range of energies going from the first ip up to ev we chose this system because it has been already studied extensively by different groups and therefore can be used in the context of an instrumental paper as performance benchmark the molecule has the particularity to fragment directly in all of its ionic states leading mostly to the formation of the cf ion thus the cf ion is never observed the first threshold onset corresponding to the ground ionic state is shown in fig the data were recorded on supersonically cooled beam of pure cf obtained from aldrich using the gr mm monochromator grating of desirs with the slits set to obtain photon resolution of mev the threshold electrons were selected with resolution of mev leading to an overall mev of the tpepico spectra by fitting an exponential curve on the experimental data we can estimate the first ip to be ip ev although this measure is unlikely to represent the adiabatic value velocity map ion imaging experiments looking at the dissociation of cf have shown jahn teller effect which breaks the symmetry of the images pointing to change in geometry that would disfavor an adiabatic transition assuming perfect mb expansion where the internal energy of cf can be neglected we can estimate the adiabatic ip as the first point that deviates from the background by value larger than its error bar to obtain ipad ev this value is ev higher than the one previously published by creasey et al and in accordance with he experiments this discrepancy cannot be explained solely by the temperature difference between our mb and their effusive jet however it should be noted that no error bars were included by these groups while ours are taking into account data statistics and the absolute precision of the gr mm monochromator grating which is estimated at mev note that the other gratings of the monochromator provide an absolute accuracy of mev the ev slow onset in the tpepico curve from the estimated ipad until reaching the expected exponential behavior might signify that vertical more energetic transitions are more probable also of interest is the ionic state illustrated in fig the tpepico spectrum of this state recorded with the same mev overall resolution has already been obtained by creasey et al but with significantly lower resolution mev we measure an adiabatic ionization potential of ip ev from the cf fragment curve in good agreement with the previously published value of ev owing to our high resolution we can very clearly observe the long vibrational progression of the symmetric stretching mode peaking at with frequency of cm ev while value of cm has been published by creasey et al note that our value is in very close agreement with the value of cm obtained by high resolution c emission spectrum in addition to the production of cf competing fragmentation pathway is made available in this ionic state leading to the formation of the cf fragment since the cf signal is significantly weaker than that of cf we have chosen to degrade the electron resolution to mev in order to increase the signal to noise ratio leading to an overall resolution of mev in these conditions we can determine the appearance potential of the cf fragment which coincides with the vibrational band e ap cf ev this difference of ev between the onset of the cf and cf pathways has already been discussed by creasey et al and indicates an energy dependence of the two competing channels on the ionic state potential energy surface cf being produced by dissociation in the and states after radiative decay from the state while cf would be produced by direct fragmentation from the state up to now we have not introduced the treatment of false coincidences contrary to the vmi single mode where the count rate is only restricted to the dead time of the detector mhz the coincidence mode needs to operate with lower count rates in order to limit false coincidences in fact the limitation arises from the timing window see sec ii opened by the arrival of the electrons during which only the ion arrival is recorded and no further electron signals are allowed thus to minimize false coincidences the electron counting rate is kept under the window maximum frequency period for instance in the ar xe example the maximum tof allowed is limiting the maximum count rate to khz the actual recording rate for this image was khz due to data flow limitations on the tdc this ratio of between the actual counting rate and the maximum possible counting rate insures very low level of false coincidences as it can be seen on the tof spectrum of fig on which no background can be seen note that for heavier masses or lower repeller voltages where the maximum allowed tof will be longer the count rate will have to be decreased the occurrence of false coincidences has been minimized in the present design due to the collection on both the electron and ion spectrometers which is not the case when one uses electrostatic analyzers for instance the only discrimination here stems from the presence of additional grids on the ion side which reduces the ion count by factor of with respect to the electrons even in the coincidence mode delicious ii operates continuously without needing to pulse the extraction plates this presents major advantage when dealing with false coincidences because they will be spread evenly along the tof spectrum giving flat background subtraction of this background is then straightforward as opposed to pulsed mode where complicated treatment schemes have to be devised contrary to other spectrometers which need the pulsed mode to ensure good electron time resolution we would use such pulsed mode only when doing very high resolution tpepico studies on heavy molecules we have presented coincidence spectrometer capable of recording mass selected velocity mapped images of photoelectrons maintaining an excellent compromise between fast and threshold electron energy resolution and ion mass resolution the apparatus is extremely versatile capable of analyzing and detecting at high counting rates electrons with kinetic energies in very large range from to ev with sub mev resolution from threshold electrons and close to for fast electrons this large versatility meets the needs of the broad scientific program we wish to cover with the desirs beamline at soleil the threshold electron resolution is comparable to that obtained using pulsed field ionization coincidence pfi pepico techniques but without the need for complicated pulsed shapes or the synchrotron time structure on the ion side we can reach mass resolutions of amu even for very low repeller voltages this mass resolution ameliorates with the square root of the repeller for experiments demanding higher resolutions so that ms studies where the electron energy resolution is not an important issue could be performed with mass resolutions above amu however due to the asymmetric peak shapes produced by the vmi focusing conditions the extraction of ker information by modeling the fragment tof shape is not possible in combination with high threshold energy resolution the spectrometer is well adapted to sr and benefits from its time structure low density photon pulse so that at most one event is produced per pulse which limits false coincidences while keeping very high repetition rate ensuring high data statistics furthermore delicious ii does not employ any electron tof measurement and hence is operated in pure continuous mode without the dependence that other spectrometers may have on the time structure of the light source this point is especially important for synchrotron facilities where the few bunch mode of operation is less and less available due to the associated severe reduction in flux the continuous mode also facilitates dramatically the treatment of false coincidences the position sensitive detection system has been chosen by its very low dead time to allow electron ion correlation in an event per event basis delicious clearly surpasses the former tpepico ref spectrometer of saphirs by its versatility possibility to also perform ar pepico its electron resolution improved by factor of and its ability to work in pure continuous mode in the multibunch mode of operation finally as in the design proposed by rolles et al the spectrometer can also be employed for mass selected ion vmi indeed by inversing the electrodes polarity and detecting the electrons with the wm tof ion images can be recorded along with their tof on the vmi side in pure continuous mode future improvements to delicious ii are already scheduled regarding the electronics new tdc will replace the ctnm tdc so that the counting rate will be only limited by the detector dead time which we plan to also improve with shorter pore to pore distances in addition we plan to add diverging lens on the vmi spectrometer as the one commonly used in photoionization microscopy imaging experiments such lens would further help to discriminate fast electrons so that the tpes resolution would be nearly photon bandwidth limited in the tpepico mode of operation this improved electron resolution would also allow us to apply higher voltages on the extraction plates removing the need for compromising between mass resolution and geometrical ion transmission and electron resolution  the use of wind energy reduces our greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere in this study we proposed generic power law relationship between global warming and the usable wind energy betz law the power law index region dependent is then determined using simulated atmospheric parameters from eight global coupled ocean atmosphere climate models cgcms it is found that the power law relationship holds across all eight climate models and also is time scale independent reduction of wind power scales with the degree of warming according to generic power law relationship thus the earlier we switch to clean energy and thereby decrease the global climate warming trend the more cost effective will be the harnessing of wind energy this relationship is an area averaged consequence of the reduced poleward temperature gradient as the climate warms during the st century it does not imply spatial uniformity over region of interest the use of clean alternative energy reduces our greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere although wind energy exists ubiquitously on earth it has not spared the effects of global warming here we would like to point out that harnessing wind energy quickly is imperative simply because this energy resource will shrink as our climate warms delayed investment means more investment technologically and financially or both the global poleward temperature gradient drives the overall circulation pattern of the earth atmosphere as the earth rotates our atmosphere operates such that the most effective means to transport energy and angular momentum poleward is through relay system from the tropics to the subtropics via the hadley circulation and from that point via midlatitude synoptic eddies of baroclinic nature high and low pressures on lower level weather maps the present atmosphere is water vapor constrained such that only limited section ahead of trough contains clouds and precipitation with the released latent heat transported to higher latitudes any factor that alters the equator pole temperature contrast will affect the strength and pattern of the large scale time averaged circulation because turbines rely on winds within the boundary layer surface topography adds yet another formidable degree of complexity all known physics considered the current global coupled ocean atmosphere climate models cgcms are well posed to address whether increased temperatures will change the circulation strength and geographical patterns so as to affect the available amount of wind energy on the whole free atmospheric winds at mid and high latitudes are predominantly quasigeostrophic thus established and maintained by baroclinity which when time averaged tends to follow the diminishing poleward temperature gradient as it warms generally the poles will tend to warm faster since the comparatively small polar regions must balance extra heat from the rest of the globe this effect is amplified by net radiative losses at the poles due to decreased polar albedo as the ice caps melt to open ocean thus strong inverse correlation is retained between regional warming and diminishing poleward temperature gradient current modern turbines have hub height around and thus utilize winds within the boundary layer where friction may alter the wind vector aloft if such ekman pumping along with dynamic effects induced by local topography is viewed as quasiconstant loss factor to link wind speeds in the free atmosphere to those available to turbines there may exist power law relationship between total wind power decreases and changes in spatially differential warming this may be depicted by the form p t mean where is the presently available wind power is wind power at future time is the amount of temperature warming over the region of interest mean is the mean temperature over the region and is numerical exponent characteristic of the region we find that such power law relationship is valid for sufficiently large regional areas especially in the mid to high latitudes the following discussion focuses on china which has committed itself to use more clean energy in the future to render our results more useful in guiding further evaluation of wind energy potential in china we also assumed the use of ge mw xle turbines with cut off wind speed of s at an air density of kg as the standard device for tapping wind resources this is monsoonal region thus horizontal temperature gradient forcings include those caused by the land sea contrast this region is also affected by the tibetan plateau through topographically induced katabatic winds the related physics are parametrized in modern cgcms wind power intensity is defined as a v betz law where is air density and is estimated using air temperature and pressure using the state equation is the intake wind speed is the exiting wind speed and wind ingestion area and are turbine parameters warming climate affects air density and wind speed two controlling factors for available wind energy the multiple climate model simulations of the th and st centuries from the world climate research program wcrp coupled model intercomparison project phase cmip archive allow us to assess monthly changes in wind power intensity within china for year periods at the end of the th and st centuries fig we used climate model estimated air temperatures air pressure and wind speeds as near to hub height for ge mw xle as was available to evaluate the above proposed power law relationship we used as wide range of climate models as possible from the cmip given constraints on data availability figure illustrates wind power changes in simulations with eight different climate models in the wcrp cmip archive cnrm cm gfdl cm inm cm mir hires ccsm echam hadcm and csiro for this suite of models we find that the following relationship applies to china as p t mean and are present and anticipated power intensities respectively as estimated by cgcm provided meteorological parameters under current climate and at future time the nearly fourth degree exponent may derive from the fact that wind power output is linear with density but increases with the cube of the wind speed betz law this relationship is time scale independent for models with subdaily data g miroc hires echam cnrm and csiro have daily and three hourly data we examined this relationship on daily time scale and the relationship was shown to hold based on the three hourly data the wind distribution shifts toward categories below s and thus becomes unavailable to the ge mw turbines with cut in wind speed of s for the upcoming years an additional empirical factor of about must be applied to the above relationship in order to model the capacity factors all eight models indicate that accessible wind energy will degrade over the course of this century g the ccsm and hadcm indicate an reduction in wind power fig that all eight models lie alongside the diagonal straight line fig is clear indication that the above proposed power law relationship holds across climate models or more directly that the reduction of wind power scales with the degree of warming according to generic power law relationship this relationship is an area averaged manifestation of the reduced poleward temperature gradient as climate warms during this century it does not imply spatial uniformity over the region of interest in fact geographical heterogeneity remains significant for the mountainous parts of china to be detailed soon these climate model estimates apply to mild future greenhouse gas emissions scenario the special report on emission scenarios b sres b ref one of three nonmitigated ipcc sress low ppmv co concentration by b medium ppmv and high rate of emission ppmv emission scenarios the b scenario foresees world characterized by low population growth very high gdp growth very high energy use low land use changes medium resource availability and rapid introduction of new and efficient technologies b thus reflects the most recent trends in the driving forces for emissions strong emission scenarios such as indicate more severe reductions in available wind resources as is apparent from our formula as increases also the climate models simulated reduction of poleward temperature gradient may underestimate reality because although all eight climate models considered the positive feedback associated with variations in snow and ice coverage as key factor amplifying climate change at high northern latitudes g ref none have explicitly implemented recent findings of methane emission from permafrost frozen soils and seeping methane clathrates along the arctic continental shelves as possible mechanisms for amplified polar warming moreover driven by tendency to maximize growth and reproduction there may be further polar amplification from live ecosystems as the climate warms up finally an extremely relevant mechanism for the tibet region of china is land ice sensitivity to global warming currently none of the eight climate models has interactive physically complete land ice dynamics and hence are unable to describe the slackening in the cold katabatic winds flowing down from the himalayas due to increased melting of glaciers and snow cover in the lower regions given these unaccounted factors there may be as much as increase in investment costs to utilize the wind resources in china by the year and onward than was estimated in ref climate prediction is about quantifying risks and probabilities although cgcms are not able to project specific day wind pattern and strength the climatological trend indicated for our region of interest seems reliable considering the broad intermodel consensus actually the extraordinary warming during the past years may be bellwether of changes to come at more drastic pace figure shows the observed wind speed changes in china between periods and for most areas there is decreasing trend for some regions at an alarming rate g over tibet and northeast china figure is reproduced from fig of ref by one of its co authors the most severe reduction in wind speed unfortunately coincides with the most economically viable wind investment regions such as the northeast with bus bar prices cheaper than rmb kwh in summary it is generic to cgcms that higher temperatures may lead to weaker atmospheric circulation over not just china but also many higher latitude regions this study provides an empirical relationship between warming and decreased wind power this will provide an important guide in planning for the future installation of wind farms e by taking the effects of global warming into consideration we show that the efficiency of tapping wind energy is adversely affected by future global warming so wind energy should be accessed as soon as possible in this study geographic features e slope angle and aspects of the land surface are assumed to change at much longer time scales than transient climate changes of anthropogenic origin thermal and or radiative differential heating exerted by local finer than climate model horizontal resolution terrain features is not considered neither is its sensitivity to climate change repeating these analyses with increased climate model resolution will likely improve the power index estimate but is unlikely to nullify the power law relationship proposed here  a new dedicated high resolution high throughput powder diffraction beamline has been built fully commissioned and opened to general users at the advanced photon source the optical design and commissioning results are presented beamline performance was examined using mixture of the nist si and al standard reference materials as well as the lab line shape standard instrumental resolution as high as q was observed many of the most interesting materials being studied today are not available in single crystal form during the critical period following the initial discovery if ever it is precisely during this initial phase that structural information is most critically needed high resolution powder diffraction thus provides key research tool for determining the structure for following the structural changes as function of temperature voltage field etc and for defining future synthetic approaches to enhance desired materials properties which may include conductivity thermal expansion biological activity or chemical activity increasingly complex chemistry and physics of modern materials demand that the structural information be obtained with high precision the increased number of applications for powder diffraction crystallography demands these data be available in routine fashion dedicated high resolution high throughput powder diffraction beamline bm was proposed constructed and commissioned at the advanced photon source aps at argonne national laboratory to facilitate high resolution crystallographic structure determination from powder diffraction of complex polycrystalline materials via high throughput mail in service model this beamline will support wide range of user interests from pharmaceuticals through traditional materials science to questions in engineering catalysis chemistry geosciences physics and electronics beamline bm is built on bending magnet source operating at an electron energy of gev with critical photon energy of kev this beamline is designed to operate in the energy range of kev and therefore can cover the absorption edge for elements from ti to la and absorption edges for elements above cs for resonant scattering studies schematic layout of the beamline is shown in fig m long mirror is located from the bending magnet source it collimates beam vertically to minimize the energy spread of the monochromator and to reduce harmonics contamination the mirror has one mm wide stripe coated in pt and another mm uncoated si stripe at mrad incident angle the pt coated stripe has cutoff energy at kev and the si region at kev the mirror is water cooled with liquid gallium indium as the heat transfer medium and is able to translate between the pt stripe and the uncoated region of the si to choose different energy the mirror acceptance is mm horizontal about mrad and mm maximum vertical defined by upstream white beam slits located from the source manual mechanical bending mechanism allows the mirror to be bent cylindrically from nearly flat profile to curvature with radius of approximately km following the collimating mirror the ray beam is monochromated by mm fixed exit double crystal si monochromator positioned from the source the first crystal is flat and water cooled and the second crystal is sagittally bent to focus the beam horizontally the sagittal focusing assembly was purchased from oxford danfysik with the design licensed to oxford danfysik from the esrf there is gear reducer and positional readout linear variable differential transformer lvdt for each bender motor the gear reducer increases the accuracy of the motion by factor of and enhances the torque necessary for high energy operation for example the bending radius is at kev the lvdt acts as an encoder and allows us to move to positional values indicated by the lvdt readouts this eliminates or significantly reduces any backlash problems the orientation of the second crystal may be adjusted with four degrees of freedom slide positions the second crystal relative to the first to maintain constant beam displacement yaw control allows rotation around the crystal surface normal which is crucial for compensating the twist of the sagittal crystal the pitch control which has both motorized coarse adjustment and piezoelectric fine adjustment allows relative adjustment of the second crystal bragg angle with respect to the first and roll control tilts the crystal around the incident beam for the purpose of equipment protection thermocouples are placed on the first crystal the pedestal supporting the second crystal and most of the control motors second uncooled mirror is situated downstream from the source to focus the beam vertically in order to obtain high intensity the dimensions and coating specifications of the second mirror replicate the first mirror the bending radius can be adjusted manually to focus beam at the sample or detector position which is about from the source to minimize the vertical divergence of the beam the optical components are positioned to provide close to demagnification ratio for vertical focusing although is the optimal demagnification ratio for sagittal focusing to ultimately satisfy the bragg condition of the incident beam with horizontal divergence the investigation of the effect of the sagittal focusing on vertical divergence by ray tracing shows that the ratio causes asymmetric and broadened distribution of the beam vertical divergence since the highest resolution for powder diffraction is driving goal for this beamline the demagnification ratio was chosen for the sagittal focusing to provide symmetric and narrow vertical divergence distribution at the cost of loss of intensity at higher energy huber two circle diffractometer is composed of two heavy duty high precision rotary tables serving as and angles respectively each with heidenhain encoder that is aligned coaxially the axis of rotation is horizontal the high angular accuracy and high precision allow the diffraction patterns peak positions to be accurate and reproducible the diffractometer the final beamline guard slits and the ion chamber are mounted on locally designed table that has motorized horizontal and vertical movements and manual rotation adjustability with these motions the diffractometer axis can be centered and made perpendicular to the ray beam newport optical table top is also attached on the diffractometer table to provide an area on which to mount the robotic sample changer sample environmental devices and other accessories sample stage with high speed sample spinner and three axis translations allows alignment of the spinner axis to the diffractometer and transverse centering of the sample along the diffractometer axis we have found that hz spinning rate optimizes sample stability while offering reasonable powder averaging for our measurements which may have count times as short as the multianalyzer detector system is unique to this instrument brief description follows more comprehensive description will be published separately to achieve high angular resolution and data collection efficiently si crystal analyzer detector systems are mounted on the diffractometer arm fig each analyzer is spaced nominally apart so scan provides measurement of range each analyzer has an associated lacl cyberstar scintillation detector the multianalyzer detector system is capable of adjusting each analyzer crystal orientation on two axes each crystal setting angle has both coarse mechanical and fine piezodriven flexure adjustment which are computer controlled the multianalyzer detector scheme reduces greatly the data collection time improves data reliability by offering redundancy to confirm that measurements are internally consistent and facilitates time resolved experiments at high resolution the detector module is also designed to prevent cross talk between the analyzer detector systems two parallel slit sets one before and one after each analyzer crystal collimate and separate the diffracted rays for each analyzer and its associated scintillation detector an experimental physics and industrial control system epics based beamline control system has been adapted to allow continuous measurements as the angle is scanned thus eliminating motor repositioning overhead the positions and the integrated counts from the detector are written to vme memory by the scaler card the vme memory is read by the instrument when the scan is finished this allows the entire high resolution powder diffraction pattern to be recorded in times as short as few minutes although more typical data collection time is another unique feature is the robotic sample exchanger in order to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness an automatic sample exchange system has been built and integrated into the diffraction system this system shown in fig exploits the high throughput capability of this beamline the locally designed fingers and interface hardware allow the commercial robot to mount exchange and dismount samples the sample capacity of samples can be expanded as needed integral to the design is an epics control module which allows the robot to be interfaced as standard beamline peripheral device as well as safety system that inhibits robotic operation where an operator could be endangered by the robot rapid motion high throughput data collection is implemented using combination of web based database interface and python instrument control scripts which will be described elsewhere an oxford cryostreams cryostream device allows automated temperature control from to to be integrated with robotic operation additional sample environmental control systems will be added at later time the evaluation of beamline performance is based mainly on two criteria the instrument resolution function irf which summarizes the instrumental line profile as function of diffraction angle and the ray photon flux and focal size of the incident beam on the sample in this section we present commissioning results from this beamline with emphasis on diffractometer system performance the measured photon flux at kev is photons at the sample position with ma current this compares well with the design value of which includes the effects of mirror acceptance in both vertical and horizontal directions reflectivities of both mirrors and bandwidth of the si monochromator the measured rocking curve of the monochromator at kev is shown in fig the rocking curve width of arcsec observed with the sagittal crystal fully focused compares well with the calculated value of arcsec at this energy for pair of perfectly flat crystals according to ray oriented programs xop the broadening of the rocking curve width could be caused by the heat load on the first crystal and the twist and strain from the sagittal crystal the loss of the measured flux is consistent with the wider rocking curve width and therefore can be attributed to imperfections in the monochromator crystals figure shows focused horizontal and vertical beam profiles at the sample position measured by the slit scan the full width at half maximum fwhm of the horizontal focal size is this is compared to the theoretical value of the reason for the discrepancy may be due to the ribbed sagittal crystal design the rib width causes the broadening of the focal size in the horizontal but necessarily reduces the anticlastic bending effect that would otherwise significantly degrade diffraction resolution the vertical profile is asymmetric and has slow falloff at the lower side resulting from tail on the bottom of the beam that is inherent to sagittal focusing the fwhm of the vertical profile of the hot spot is about which is in very good agreement with its calculated value when considering the source vertical size the mirrors slope errors and the focal ratio in real sample experiments the vertical beam focal size can be adjusted to match the sample size the ability to focus the beam finely is very advantageous when the material being studied is available only in microgram quantities for example the material synthesized at high pressure the rocking curve widths of all analyzers were measured with an attenuated directed beam as shown in fig these measurements are repeated routinely to check the diffractometer performance initially the independent tilt adjustment was performed to optimize each analyzer so all analyzers could have nearly identical shape and width for the rocking curve this allows the data from all detectors to be treated as equivalent allowing the measurements to be merged and simplifying data analysis the slight difference in reflectivity shown in fig is most likely due to the different responses from the detectors and electronics the measured rocking curve is symmetric and the fwhm of the rocking curve is which is very close to the expected value the analyzer rocking curve width could be viewed as the instrument resolution irf at zero the irf is measured by observing diffraction peak widths as function of an understanding irf allows the evaluation of the overall performance of the powder diffraction system the irf is also needed for microstructure studies as it allows separation of sample dependent diffraction profile effects from those of the instrument an analytical expression for irf was determined by sabin in for multicrystal spectrometers and parallel beam optics and assuming gaussian peak line shape extending sabin work gozzo et al developed more general equation which is applicable to an optical system with collimating and vertical focusing mirrors for the optical arrangements implemented in bm as shown in fig this irf has the following form fwhm m tan tan tan tan a where is the residual source divergence after the first collimating mirror including the mirror slope error effect is the beam divergence after the second vertical focusing mirror including the effect from the sagittal focusing is the darwin width of the monochromator crystal and is the darwin width of the analyzer crystal based on the equation given above the first term has dispersive dependence as function of but the other two terms are constant therefore the shape of the irf curve is dominated by the first term this expression provides guide to optimize the optics especially the two mirrors curvatures in order to properly collimate the beam and optimize vertical focus we measured instrumental profiles convoluted with those of well characterized sample at the bm instrument from diffraction pattern of the nist lab srm powder the data shown in fig were collected at kev with step size the intensity scale in this figure is counts per second per ma of ring current number of strong diffraction peaks over wide range were selected and fitted individually by the cmpr program where pseudo voigt function was employed to describe the peak profile the finger cox jephcoat asymmetric function did not produce significant improvement in the quality of the fits indicating that the horizontal focusing has rendered axial divergence negligible in order to avoid possible introduction of broadening caused by merging the diffraction patterns from the multidetector system data from single detector were used the fwhm of each diffraction peak accounting for both gaussian and lorentzian broadening are plotted as function of in fig these fwhms include the sample particle size effect to estimate the broadening contribution due to finite crystallite size the lorentzian components to the psudo voigt fwhm were analyzed using williamson hall plot as shown in fig from this we estimate crystallite size effect of about where is as sin and is cos where is the width of the lorentizian component of each peak by fitting the measured fwhms in fig using the formula given above plus the particle size effect added in quadrature we obtained the focusing beam divergence as rad and the residual source divergence as rad considering that the analyzer rocking curve width is rad the source vertical size is and the mirror slope error is arcsec these two fitted parameters are in good agreement with the expected values the crystallite size parameter of fitted by the scherrer formula is completely consistent with the result of the williamson hall plot in fig we convert the angular units of fig into reciprocal space units at high values the instrument resolution drops below the design specification of q to without correction for the crystallite size effect instrumental mixture of nist srms si and al was measured at kev with step size and ms counting time at each point over range of its powder diffraction profile is shown as cross symbols in fig rietveld refinement was performed using the program gsas through expgui fitting each of the detectors individually during this refinement the only fixed parameters were the unit cell and position of si and the polarization of the incident beam applying corrections for the zero offsets scale factors and minor differences in wavelength for each detector it became possible to overlay and average the detectors together even though the wavelength differences were very small ev in kev these corrections were absolutely necessary to avoid discrepancies in peak positions during averaging in fig the summed observed diffraction pattern is shown as cross symbols and is overlaid by calculated diffraction pattern solid line the difference profile is shown at the bottom the refinement statistics are rwp and rp diffraction measurements with this standard mixture can be made in half an hour or less and the calibration refinement has been automated the calibration parameters are recorded in calibration data file that is then used for user data reduction we did beam stability study during aps non top up operation mode which refills electrons twice day in the morning and evening the current gradually decays from to ma therefore the worst situation will be if something was not stable due to heat load figure shows selected diffraction peak at high angle from the lab collected over the course of several hours no position shifts were observed however over the course of day and half minor peak position shifts were seen at high angles from the srm mixture as shown in fig while the low angle peaks were stable fig the shift at high angle of is about which could be caused by wavelength drift on the order of likely due to beam angle drift of rad on the monochromator according to our test the drift depends primarily on the accumulated beam on time and very little on the beam current we think that one of the possible reasons could be the thermal expansion on the mechanical support system of the collimating mirror due to secondary scattering induced heating for most of the planned experimental work with measurements made on time scale of hours there would be no effect from these drifts measurements that seek to observe level differences in lattice parameters over the course of day or longer will need to incorporate an internal standard or make more frequent calibrations the new aps bm beamline is dedicated to high resolution high throughput powder diffraction it has been fully commissioned and optimized mail in operation within the aps general user program started in october the robotic sample changer has being running with high reliability in order to efficiently run high throughput operation we have developed and implemented web based user interface to supply sample information that is interfaced to the instrument automation wide range of scientific research has been conducted at bm including condensed matter physics chemistry materials science mineralogy and biological and pharmaceutical sciences recent scientific research results are already being published  we demonstrate highly integrated microfluidic chip with the function of dna amplification the integrated chip combines giant electrorheological fluid actuated micromixer and micropump with microheater array all formed using soft lithography internal functional components are based on polydimethylsiloxane pdms and silver carbon black pdms composites the system has the advantages of small size with high degree of integration high polymerase chain reaction efficiency digital control and simple fabrication at low cost this integration approach shows promise for broad range of applications in chemical synthesis and biological sensing analysis as different components can be combined to target desired functionalities with flexible designs of different microchips easily realizable through soft lithography microfluidic chip applications in microchemical reactions and biological analysis have been actively pursued in recent years in particular technological development aiming for multifunctional lab on chip loc devices has received much attention with the integration of various microcomponents as the route to realize chips that not only are portable automated and free from contamination but also can save processing time and valuable reagents it has been reported that single chip microreactors were used to manipulate multistep synthesis of radiolabeled molecular imaging probe with integrated microvalves long term monitoring of bacteria has been achieved with programmed population control in microchemostat printed circuit board pcb based microfluidic mixer valves and pumps combination with dna microarray detection capability has been realized recently an integrated microfluidic platform was employed to automate cell culture and lysis microfluidic chip system was also reported which can massively produce monodisperse emulsion droplets and particles and an integrated microchip has successfully realized inside microdroplets detection and manipulations it is clear that highly integrated microfluidic chips will be an essential enabling technology in the future biochemical field as an essential method in molecular biology pcr rt pcr polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription pcr can analyze minimal starting quantities of nucleic acid as little as one cell equivalent owing to its sensitivity and rapidity pcr rt pcr has realized broad applications in clinic diagnosis and environment monitoring in particular pcr rt pcr has been shown to be effective in the molecular diagnosis of pathogens such as virus g hepatitis virus human immunodeficiency virus influenza virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus g sars cov bacterial g cerebral meningitis and other pandemic infections it serves as an appealing alternative to the conventional culture based and immunoassay based clinical diagnose the accepted standard for detecting nucleic acids in various samples for pcr mixing of the relevant reagents and accurate temperature control are the two essential process elements various micro pcr pcr integrated systems have been developed to achieve these functions for example one flow through pcr based on silicon and glass substrate chips was reported pcr with real time fluorescence detection in isolated droplets on single chip has also been intensively studied research on lab on chip micro pcr system has focused on developing disposable chips at low costs however in spite of full integration of dna analysis functions in developed biochips some main components such as pumping and mixing are still not part of the one chip pcr devices owing to the complexities of design and fabrication in this paper we present chip size microfluidic system integrated with valves mixer pump as well as the heater array with digital control its function of dna amplification was successfully demonstrated the full integration of the various components is made possible by the use of smart materials in combination with integrated electrodes and heater arrays made from polydimethylsiloxane pdms and nano micro particle based conducting composite giant electrorheological ger fluid is colloidal suspension consisting of nm particles its apparent viscosity can be tunable through the external electric field strength er fluid can offer high shear stress more than kpa at relatively low voltages with response time on the order of ms these properties enable the er fluid to be an ideal material for micromechanical devices controllable through applied voltages in our highly integrated chip all the components such as valves mixer and pump etc are integrated inside and actuated by ger fluid and thermal controls are operated with inner pdms based heater array thus the chip is independent from large number of external control devices and less susceptible to cross contamination also these on chip functional components offer advantages of flexible design ease and rapid in fabrication low cost simple and accurate operations it is believed that this method will easily lead to various integrated biochips with different components flexible combinations figure shows schematic diagram of microchip multilayered structure where the lower layer is the control layer that dictates the status of the main reaction channel located in the upper layer elastic pdms diaphragms sandwiched between the lower and upper layers serve to separate the fluids in the two layers as well as to displace the reaction fluids in the upper layer channels via their up and down elastic deformations the latter is the basic actuation mechanism of the ger fluid pump as described below two ger fluid channels marked with blue each mm deep were used for activating the micromixer and micropump there are three branch channels for the micropump each sandwiched between pair of pdms based electrodes as the ger fluid can respond to applied electric field by increasing its viscosity flows inside the channel can be slowed in the electrode region upon the application of voltage the variation in flow rate is directly translated into fluid pressure that can act upon the pdms diaphragms deforming it either up or down under series of coordinated electrical signals applied to the three electrodes on the three branch channels pressure differences will be established in such fashion so that pumping action is generated by the diaphragms to propel the fluid in the upper level main channel with flow direction perpendicular to the three branch channels see fig for the mixer there are two ger fluid channels with two pairs of electrodes sharing common ground pressure conditions in the two branches are designed to be opposite in phase and alternating in time leading to pulsating flow in mixer side channels that are perpendicular to the main channel via the actions of the diaphragms the pulsating flow of the side channels is what drives the mixing action in the main channel there are also three air valve channels distributed within the lower layer driven by compressed air they produce on off functions to control the flow of microreagents during the pcr process there is heater array comprising three adjacent microheaters shown in fig with electrical control signals desired temperatures can be maintained within the helical patterned areas in the three heating chambers located in the upper layer to avoid interferences among the three heaters an adiabatic groove is made to surround each of the heaters for thermal insulation figure is cartoon illustrating the entire chip with the layers combined together tubes connected to the chip upper and lower surfaces serve to deliver reaction solutions ger fluid and compressed air the tubes at the upper surface are for biological materials input with the two colored in gray being the inlets to the mixing chamber for the reagents of master mixertm promega inc template and primer mixture the other two are gas inlet and sample outlet three holes were drilled close to the heating sections of the heater array for the installation of temperature sensors as part of the feedback control for the heating chambers the upper inset of fig is an image of the integrated chip which is mm in length and mm wide hong kong dollar mm in diameter is shown for comparison water with dissolved dyes was used to help visualize the different chip components figure shows the operations necessary to realize dna amplification reaction reagents are introduced into the mixer from the inlets shown in fig mixing of the reagents is achieved inside the ger fluid mixer with the proper setting of the three valves as indicated in fig the reagents mixture would flow directly to the reaction loop as shown by the red arrows where the two fluid branches are designed to have equal volumes the mixed reagents are divided into two streams to fill the reaction loop delineated by blue in fig once the reaction loop is filled all valves are closed as indicated in fig with the circulation inside the reaction loop actuated by the ger pump by applying preset voltages to the heater array that is located right beneath the heat chambers temperatures of and can be stabilized in each of the chambers assisted by feedback control system the reagent mixture forms counterclockwise circulating flow pattern within the reaction loop realizing dna amplification in each cycle when the scheduled cycles have been accomplished compressed air is used to propel the product through the opened valve as shown in fig the lower left inset of fig shows an enlarged photo image of the valves status corresponding to that in fig it is clear that the right valve is closed by the compressed air underneath thereby closing off the reaction loop from the mixer while the product is driven out through the open left valve below we describe the performances of mixer heater array and the ger micropump in more detail followed by presentation of results on dna amplification figure shows the reagents green master mixer and the colorless template and primer mixture injected from the left side by syringe pump with the same flow rate of ml these two fluids met at the main channel in width that has eight groups of perpendicular side channels eight flow baffles were deployed at the cross sections between the main and side channels shown in fig for the purpose of enhancing mixing efficiency when there was no pulsating side channel flow the two streams in the main channel followed laminar flow characteristics with fluid fluid interface only slightly blurred by molecular interdiffusion this was reflected in the luminosity distribution obtained with commercial software photoshop showing two luminosity peaks that correspond to the two reagents in the nonmixing state in fig when an alternating kv mm electric field was applied to the electrodes to actuate the ger fluid the diaphragms located on two ends of the side channels were deformed to move up and down thereby generating synchronous pulsating flow hz perpendicular to the main channel due to the presence of flow baffles the interface between the two reagents was split and torn by the geometric corners leading to effective mixing in fig an enlarged image of the mixed fluid is seen to display homogeneous color with single luminosity peak showing the mixing to be effective temperature control is perhaps the most significant element for pcr amplification in our chip microheaters were fabricated with silver particles pdms composite by using soft lithography and combined to form heater array figure shows the detailed fabrication procedure mold with photoresist az was fabricated on glass substrate via soft lithography step to yield designed pattern of the heater array mixture of sized ag particles and pdms at the silver concentration of w was prepared and filled the mold step after the composite was baked at for one hour the mold was removed with acetone leaving the patterned conducting wires on the substrate step in step mm thick metal frame was placed around the wire patterns to create the adiabatic grooves for heat insulation in later steps thereafter liquid pdms was poured fully covering the frame and the patterns after curing the pdms layer was lifted off together with the conducting patterns leaving behind the substrate and the frame step the last step involves six hour hard baking at to improve the conductivity of the silver pdms composite the upper panel of fig shows an image of the heater array each heater is thick surrounded with mm deep adiabatic groove to test the designed thermal insulation and temperature control of the heater array an infrared ir camera flir systems trademark model prism ds was employed to detect both the heat images and the local temperatures in fig the upper panel is an infrared image showing the temperature distributions of the heaters ii and iii with predefined temperatures of and respectively intended for denaturizing annealing and extension in the pcr processing to obtain desired and stable temperatures three temperature sensors have been installed into the chips shown in fig they are connected to control box which receive signals from them and provide suitable pulse voltages for the heaters as feedback controls for the chambers temperatures the targeted temperatures as function of the horizontal position are shown as the red line in the lower panel in fig several points on the reagents flow path were selected as shown in the figure where the temperatures were independently measured the data are plotted in the figure below to compare with the target temperature profile red line it is seen that the actual temperatures of the heating zones approach very closely to the targeted temperature profile within each zone the temperatures are almost constant but they change sharply between the two adjacent zones this may be attributed to the good thermal insulation characteristic of the air adiabatic groove the small size of the thin film microheaters and the small thermal conductivity of pdms as temperatures in each zone can be precisely controlled desirable temperature kinetics for pcr can thus be attained to achieve successful pcr amplification with the heater array ger fluid pump was designed to circulate reagents flow with controlled cycle times figure shows the measured flux as function of applied electric field to the ger fluid pump in the experiment hz applied electric signals were applied on the ger fluid to achieve smooth circular flows within the reaction loop channel test points blue squares can be well fitted by an exponential dependence shown as the red line to obtain the desired flux four mapping points from to were generated along the exponential fit so as to determine desired electric field schematic drawing was shown in the upper panel of fig where denaturation annealing and extension chambers are illustrated with specific volumes the volumes of annealing and extension chambers are two times larger than the denaturation chamber this is designed so that the heating time for reagents in the first two chambers is double that in the last chamber under the same flow rate figure also shows table listing the desired flux under specific electric field applied to ger fluid pump electrodes together with the cycle times it is noted that when the applied field increases flux increases monotonously and the pcr cycle time is shortened accordingly with thermal cycles as the target and total volume of in the reaction loop complete pcr process takes min as listed after total of thermal cycles for each sample final products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis stained with sybr safe invitrogen photographed by gel imaging system alpha innotech corp the results are shown in fig indicated under each strip is the total reaction time from left to right of and min to the right is gene ruler bp dna ladder fermentas inc alphaease fc alpha innotech corp gel imaging software which was utilized to determine the relative yield of each strip the relative band intensities are plotted as function of reaction times as shown in fig it is seen that the yield increases remarkably as the reaction time increases with the maximum band intensity at min reaching about times that of the bp segment of the ladder however long reaction time is not favored since undesirable bubbles can be generated in the heating chamber when the reagents stayed too long and that would hinder the smooth circular flow within the reaction loop channel during each cycle the denaturation and extension reaction steps in our experiments were restricted to their fixed regions without the heat initiation and final extension steps it is believed that the amplification efficiency can be further increased by adding these two steps in summary we have demonstrated microfluidic chip with integrated components of ger fluid actuated micromixer micropump and microheater array the chip is capable of dna amplification and its fabrication is based on soft lithography with all the internal functional components involving only pdms and silver carbon black pdms composites owing to the diverse possible combinations of the functional components and their flexible designs many different target applications may be conveniently realized efforts along these directions are currently under way  multilayer structures of tio ag tio have been deposited onto flexible substrates by room temperature sputtering to develop indium free transparent composite electrodes the effect of ag thicknesses on optical and electrical properties and the mechanism of conduction have been discussed the critical thickness tc of ag mid layer to form continuous conducting layer is nm and the multilayer has been optimized to obtain sheet resistance of sq and an average optical transmittance of at nm the haacke figure of merit fom for tc has one of the highest foms with sq flexible thin films of transparent conducting oxide tco are extensively used for variety of applications in optoelectronic industry such as solar cells electrochromic devices liquid crystal displays and organic light emitting diodes the introduction of room temperature route for deposition of highly conductive and transparent material onto flexible substrates could change the future of several photonic and electronic devices with the potential to influence wide spectrum of applications until now amorphous indium tin oxide ito has been commonly used as transparent electrode for flexible optoelectronic applications due to its low resistivity cm and high transmittance in the visible region however ito film deposited on flexible substrates has some limitations such as fairly lower conductivity owing to low process temperature and reduced dopant activation at lower temperatures the reduction in thickness of the electrode material to attain better mechanical flexibility also results in the poor conductivity problem indium is also rare and highly expensive metal and thus makes the resulting fabrication costs excessive for future applications thus these factors have attracted sufficient amount of attention in search for cheaper materials with good opto electrical properties promising alternative materials include pure sno zno or zno doped with metals e aluminum al gallium ga etc nb tio graphene and carbon nanotube cnt sheets have been recently studied as potential alternatives to ito electrodes on flexible substrates recently insertions of very thin metal layer sandwiched between the two tco layers have been studied to develop transparent composite electrode tce with the desired electrical conductivity although metals have high reflectivity very thin films nm show moderate transmittance in the visible region and the top dielectric layer helps to obtain higher transparent effect by diminishing the reflection from the metal layer these oxide metal oxide omo multilayers are more efficient than single layer tco film titanium dioxide tio is potential semiconductor material with wide band gap ev and good adhesion to the glass and plastic substrates it has many excellent physical properties such as high dielectric constant and strong mechanical and chemical stability due to its high refractive index of about and optical transmittance of above in the visible range tio can be used as optical coatings on large area substrates for architectural automotive and display applications and protective layers for very large scale integrated circuits in this work the high transparency of tio in visible region and low resistivity of thin ag layer lead us to the detailed study of optical and electrical properties of tio ag tio tat multilayer as tces the multilayer transparent conductive electrodes have been deposited onto flexible substrates by sputtering at room temperature the performance of this system based on the optical and electrical properties has been evaluated using figure of merit fom the tio ag tio multilayer thin films of different silver thicknesses were sequentially deposited onto thick flexible polyethylene naphthalate pen and si substrates by rf magnetron sputtering of ceramic tio target purity and dc sputtering of pure ag target purity at room temperature without any vacuum break the tio and ag were deposited using rf power and dc power of and respectively bare tio layers were also deposited under identical conditions on pen to compare the physical properties the top and bottom tio layers were approximately nm thick while the silver thickness was varied between and nm the thicknesses of the tat multilayer films were determined using optical ellipsometry scanning electron microscope xl esem philips at an operating voltage of kv was used to analyze the surface morphology of different thicknesses of ag layers grown on the bottom tio layer hall measurements by the van der pauw technique with magnetic field of were done using the ecopia hms instrument four point probe technique was used for sheet resistance measurements optical transmittance of the multilayers was measured using an ocean optics double channel spectrometer model ds in the wavelength range of nm with an air reference for transmittance deuterium and tungsten halogen lamps were used as sources for uv and visible light respectively systematic study is done in order to determine the effect of ag mid layer on the opto electrical properties of multilayer thin films the most vital factor that influences the performance of the composite is the morphology of the middle metal layer it is known that the ag film growing on an amorphous tio surface should follow the island growth mechanism of volmer weber model which is verified from the microstructure in fig the sem images correspond to different ag thicknesses before and after the critical thickness of nm figure shows the presence of island structures which gradually form contiguous layer as it approaches the critical thickness fig finally the ag islands form continuous layer fig at nm in order to achieve high transmittance in the visible region the thickness of the ag layer is limited to an optimum thickness so that the tat multilayers exhibit high conductivity as well as transparency figure shows the change in carrier concentration and hall mobility as function of ag thickness for various tat multilayers the plot indicates that carrier concentration depends strongly on the ag thickness the carrier concentration of the tat multilayer has increased from to cm upon increase in ag thickness from to nm hence metallic conduction is dominant in this tat system there is rapid increase in hall mobility that occurs with increasing ag layer thickness from cm s at nm to cm s at nm respectively there are many scattering mechanisms such as phonon scattering grain boundary scattering surface scattering interface scattering and ionized impurity scattering since tio is an amorphous and intrinsic semiconductor one can exclude the possibility of ionized impurity scattering in our tce interface scattering takes place above the critical thickness of nm whereas island boundary scattering dominates at the tio ag interface below the critical thickness due to the presence of ag island structures these boundaries are expected to have fairly high densities of interface states which scatter free carriers due to the presence of trapped charges and inherent disorders as result space charge region is created in the island boundaries which results in potential barriers to charge transport due to band bending this transport phenomenon in polycrystalline thin films can be expressed by petritz model where the mobility is written as documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation mu mu exp frac phi k t end equation end document exp bkbt where mu displaystyle frac e pi k t frac e kbt is the island size is the elementary charge is the island boundary potential and kb is the boltzmann constant figure shows the effect of ag mid layer on the resistivity and sheet resistance of tat multilayers where both decrease with increasing thickness of the ag mid layer in the multilayer in this case tio is an insulator with resistivity of the order of cm on depositing nm ag film between the tio layers the resistivity decreases to cm and suggests that there is fold decrease in resistivity in tat multilayers when compared to bare tio as the ag thickness is increased from nm to nm the effective resistivity gradually decreases down to cm more detailed investigation of fig shows that the effective resistivity of the tat multilayers drops significantly from to nm and indicates the presence of small ag island structures in case of nm deposition however there is slow decrease in the effective resistivity of the multilayers from to nm with tat multilayers approaching the resistivity of bulk silver the change in effective resistivity of the tat multilayer films with increasing ag thickness can be explained using the following basic relation documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation rho eff frac rm mu end equation end document eff ne the sheet resistance curve follows similar trend to that of resistivity as function of ag thickness achieving data close to bulk ag on nm thickness here also we see rapid decrease in sheet resistance from sq to sq as the mid ag layer increases from to nm however the total resistance of the tat multilayer is result of parallel combination of the three individual layers of tio ag tio and is shown in fig figure shows the effect of ag mid layer on the effective resistivity and sheet resistance of the tat multilayers where both parameters decrease with increasing thickness of the ag mid layer from the microstructure of the ag thin film it is clear that the ag film deposited was discontinuous below the critical thickness tc and gradually became continuous after tc hence we expect different conduction mechanism before and after critical thickness conduction through the dielectric dominates when the metal islands are very small and space between islands is large as the islands grow the separation between the islands decreases and some of the islands undergo coalesce in large scale this leads to radical drop in resistance as observed in lower thickness region of fig quantum tunneling occurs between the larger islands with small gaps between them while bulk conduction occurs through the contiguous layer the effective conductivity in this region is governed by the following equation documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation sigma propto exp beta frac k t end equation end document exp wkbt where is the island charging energy is the island separation is the tunneling exponent of electron wave functions in the insulator is the boltzmann constant and is the temperature rough surface or interface results in more diffuse scattering and thus increases resistivity of the thin film that can be either surface scattering or grain boundary scattering these phenomena are less prominent as the metal thickness approaches the mean free path of the conducting electrons mayadas and shatzkes explained that the effect of grain boundary scattering is more predominant in polycrystalline thin films as the grain size is smaller than when the ag islands form contiguous layer the decrease in resistivity is governed by the combined effect of the increase in carrier concentration of conducting electrons and mobility at this stage the dominant factor affecting resistivity was surface boundary scattering the conductivity in this region behaves according to the following equation documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation frac sigma sigma propto frac kappa log frac kappa end equation end document log where is the fraction of the distribution function of the electrons arriving at the surface represents the conductivity of the bulk metal and o figure shows optical transmittance spectra for tio ag tio multilayers on pen substrate as function of silver thicknesses the maximum optical transmittance of the pure single layer tio film is about in the visible region tat multilayers show maximum transmittance of for nm ag thickness at nm wavelength it was observed that there is parabolic increase in average optical transmittance with increasing ag thickness and the trend is different for middle nm and longer wavelengths which can be explained based on scattering and absorption by the ag mid layer the difference at nm wavelength region is due to light scattering at the tio ag interface in ag isolated islands for ag thickness below nm and absorption of light due to interband electronic transitions from the to unoccupied levels in the band above fermi level however below this thickness the transmittance decreases because the silver islands are discontinuous in discontinuous ag films size dependent variation in the dielectric function is known to exist due to limitation of the mean free path of the conduction electrons this leads to correction to the imaginary part of the overall dielectric function given by documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation varepsilon varepsilon frac r end equation end document m cr where is the dielectric constant of the bulk metal is constant at particular wavelength and is the particle radius as result the transmittance decreases with smaller island size below the critical thickness as the ag thickness increases the ag becomes continuous layer from discontinuous islands that causes decrease in light scattering in the visible region higher transmittance was observed which can also be explained on the coupling between the incident light and surface plasmon of the island like structures of ag thin films however in the longer wavelength nm region the transmittance decreased abruptly for larger ag thickness nm trend similar to the optical behavior of bulk metals in the near ir region the increase in electron carriers results in low transmission is due to plasmon absorption dependent reflection from the drude lorentz free electron model the plasmon frequency can be expressed by the following equation documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation omega sqrt frac ne varepsilon end equation end document ne where is the carrier density of electrons and is the permittivity of free space figure of merit tc as defined by haacke was estimated for each of the tat multilayers using the following relationship documentclass pt minimal begin document begin equation varphi tc frac av sh end equation end document tc tav rsh where tav is the average transmittance and rsh is the sheet resistance the multilayer with mid ag thickness nm has the best figure of merit with which is one of the highest foms reported till date on flexible substrate at room temperature in conclusion different multilayer structures of tio ag tio have been deposited on pen characterized and developed as transparent conductive film with low resistance hall measurements and sheet resistance data show that the conductivity of the tat multilayer is solely due to the ag mid layer the multilayer stack has been optimized to have sheet resistance of sq and an average optical transmittance of at nm the multilayer with mid ag thickness nm has the best figure of merit with this makes it possible to synthesize low resistivity electrode at room temperature without using high substrate temperature or post annealing process thus the tat multilayers on pen substrates can be used as transparent electrode for solar cell and other display application  high temperature nanoindentation was used to reveal nano layer size effects on the hardness of two dimensional metallic nanocomposites we report the existence of critical layer thickness at which strength achieves optimal thermal stability transmission electron microscopy and theoretical bicrystal calculations show that this optimum arises due to transition from thermally activated glide within the layers to dislocation transmission across the layers we demonstrate experimentally that the atomic scale properties of the interfaces profoundly affect this critical transition the strong implications are that interfaces can be tuned to achieve an optimum in high temperature strength in layered nanocomposite structures for increased energy efficiency in many future applications there is an outstanding need for robust materials that sustain their strength at high temperatures in this regard nanocomposite metallic multilayers nmms are garnering much interest as promising candidates for materials in extreme conditions nmms are nanostructured thin films or sheets that contain alternating layers of dissimilar metals with individual thicknesses far below nm consequently nmms are comprised of an unusually high density of bimetal interfaces experiments have shown that these interface rich composites are several times stronger and structurally more stable after exposure to high temperature and or radiation environments than their constituents the high temperature strength of the nmms however has not been quantified current strategies for understanding the influence of temperature on nmm performance typically involve room temperature tests on nmms that have been previously exposed to elevated temperatures with the recent progress in the development of the high temperature nanoindentation ht nano testing technique it is now possible to study the deformation mechanisms within localized region of the material at high temperatures and this capability has been shown very valuable to study two dimensional nanocomposites in this work we combine the ht nano technique and crystal plasticity theory to study the effect of interface structure and layer thickness on the high temperature behavior of model nmm we discover that critical layer thickness lcrit exists at which the reduction in hardness due to temperature is minimal we propose that lcrit corresponds to the layer thickness at which the dislocation mechanism transitions from intralayer slip to interface crossing the results suggest that the latter mechanism leads to much larger reduction in hardness with temperature with this critical insight the possibility of tuning interfaces and their spacing within nmms to optimize performance at high temperature becomes attainable recently few experimental and numerical studies have provided clues that the behavior of nmms is sensitive to the structure of these interfaces which suggests that there is potential for tuning material properties via interface design with this in mind we further explore the influence of interface structure by carrying out ht nano testing on two nmms with different processing histories physical vapor deposited pvd cu nb thin films and accumulative roll bonded arb cu nb sheets more details on material fabrication can be found in the supplementary material extensive experimental work has shown that these two cu nb nmms have significantly different interface structures the preferred interface character in the pvd foils is the classical kurdjumov sachs ks cu nb interface whereas in the arb nmms the predominant interface character is cu nb both high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem and atomic scale calculations report that the pvd ks interface is atomically flat while the arb interface is atomically faceted nanoindentation measurements were performed using nanotest platform instrument micromaterials wrexham uk fitted with diamond berkovich tip the tests were carried out in inert atmosphere to minimize surface oxidation and both the sample and indenter tip were heated independently to ensure thermal equilibrium conditions more details on the ht nano testing can be found in the supplementary material the mean and standard deviations in hardness of the arb and pvd cu nb nmms are plotted in fig as function of layer thickness and temperature for both cu nb nmms the room temperature hardness increases or saturates with decreasing we find that the strengthening behavior seen in fig differs from that of single phase cu based nanomaterials in nanocrystalline cu reduction in strength softening is observed for grain sizes of nm and below in nanotwinned cu strength softening is reported for twin spacings on average nm and below the high temperature testing reveals some interesting differences between the pvd and arb nmms first pvd nmms are consistently harder than the arb nmms at all temperatures this result is in agreement with the trends observed in recent room temperature studies on cu nb nmms second the room temperature hardness saturates and the high temperature hardness decreases at nm for the arb cu nb nmm by contrast the strength continues to increase with decreasing layer thickness for all temperatures in the pvd cu nb nmm even for the smallest layer thickness of nm it has been suggested that the plateau or softening signifies the predominance of dislocation glide across interfaces over dislocation glide within individual layers the mechanism of interface crossing is thermally activated and in principle would be enhanced by elevated temperatures the results in fig are the first indirect experimental evidence that the interfaces in the arb nmms are easier for dislocations to cross than those in the pvd nmms it is desirable that nanomaterials strengthen as much as possible with decreasing exhibiting positive and strong size effect corresponding to the slope of the strength versus layer thickness curve interestingly the size effect in the pvd foils was enhanced by deforming at higher temperatures over the entire layer thickness range nm studied similar results were found in arb nmms for layer thicknesses above nm this is the first report of strength related size effect that can be enhanced with increasing temperature even more remarkable is the apparent existence of critical layer thickness lcrit at which the reduction in hardness with temperature achieves minimum in the case of the arb nmms lcrit is around nm we observe softening in the arb material for layer thicknesses below nm for the pvd material it is apparent that lcrit is at most nm to better elucidate the effect of on temperature induced softening we plot in fig the evolution of the ratio between that hardness at and the room temperature hardness as function of lcrit when normalized in this way we observe that the hardness reduction due to temperature decreases as decreases within lcrit this trend occurs for both the arb and pvd nmms at least in the range for which data are available for both systems e lcrit furthermore identical trends were observed at in pvd nmms and at in arb nmms it bears emphasis that the unprecedented high temperature effects discussed above would not have been apparent in post annealing hardness test as the room temperature hardnesses of the samples before and after high temperature testing were similar due to the novelty of the ht results it is critical to check for compromising effects that can arise during high temperature indentation like surface oxidation thermal drift and or incorrect determination of the indenter contact areas due to pile up effects atomic force microscopy scans of room temperature and high temperature indentations included in the supplementary material show some degree of pile up around the indentations while sink in behavior was not observed however the hardness computed from the measured contact areas using the conventional hardness definition p ac was in good agreement with the ht nano results shown in the supplementary material confirming that the high temperature values were free of thermal drift and or errors in contact area determination due to pile up effects some signs of surface oxidation were visible at but not extensively as matter of fact the elastic modulus at dropped approximately with respect to the room temperature value as shown in the ht nano results in the supplementary material independently of which is in agreement with the reduction expected for the constituents thus surface oxidation did not affect the hardness results to shed more light on potential deformation mechanisms such as twinning shear banding interfacial sliding or layer coarsening selected indents were sectioned by focused ion beam fib figure shows tem cross sectional images of the indents on the pvd cu nb nmms with nm for rt and t figure also shows cross sectional image of an indent on the arb cu nb with nm at c the layered structure is well preserved under the indents irrespective of temperature with the layer planes rotating to follow the profile of the indentation imprint no evidence of cracking shear banding twinning or localized deformation was found no layer coarsening due to temperature annealing was observed consistent with results from post annealing studies involving no deformation on these materials to investigate the possibility of interfacial sliding we utilize tem to measure the differences in the cu and nb layer thickness within the deformed region affected by the indent as shown in the corresponding higher magnification images in figures and the average layer thickness after room temperature nanoindentation in the pvd nmm with nm varied from nm cu nm nb well away from the indent in agreement with the nominal thickness to approximately nm cu nm nb at nm below the indent and finally nm cu nm nb at few nm under the indent likewise the average layer thicknesses after high temperature nanoindentation varied from nm cu nm nb at nm below the indent in agreement with the nominal thicknesses to nm cu nm nb at nm below the indent and finally to final thickness of nm cu nm nb closer to the indent at nm similar trends were observed for the pvd nmm with nm these observations suggest that for lcrit the joined cu and nb crystals are co deforming similar measurements in arb nmms are more challenging due to the variability of the nominal layer thickness inherent to this processing method but the high resolution electron microscopy hrem image of figure shows evidence of confined layer slip within the cu layers to separate the contributions of interface crystallography from other atomic scale interface properties we carried out crystal plasticity simulations of cu nb bicrystal deformed under compression normal to the interface temperature and rate effects are incorporated into the anisotropic elasticity and dislocation plasticity laws used to model the cu and nb crystals the model set up considers cu single crystal and nb single crystal bound together at common interface as observed experimentally the single crystals are constrained to co deform by imposing displacement and traction continuity across the interface during deformation with the above elements the model can provide basic insight into the combined effect of elastic and plastic anisotropy and temperature detailed description of the model is given in the supplementary material as shown in fig the model predicts that the arb interfaces would result in lower hardness than the pvd interfaces in agreement with the experimental observations the predicted difference of underestimates the actual experimental differences reported here g pvd nmms are harder than arb nmms for nm but agrees with experimental results in other works the model however does not have an explicit dependence on layer thickness as shown in the supplementary material therefore we find that the combined effect of elastic and plastic anisotropy and the predominant texture developed as function of processing method can account for most of the differences between the hardness of the pvd and arb processed nmms with the same layer thickness the model also helps in understanding the actual drop of hardness with temperature at different layer thicknesses figures and compare the predicted and measured reduction in hardness normalized by the room temperature hardness with temperature for each and processing method this normalization was selected in order to isolate the effect of temperature only as shown the magnitude of the reduction in hardness as temperature increases from to is well captured by the model in agreement for lcrit the regime where deformation is proposed to be controlled by intralayer slip the experimental reductions in are similar for the arb and pvd materials being slightly larger for the arb subtle difference that is also predicted reduction for arb and reduction for pvd this agreement suggests that for lcrit temperature effects can be attributed to higher dislocation mobility at elevated temperatures due to the lower stresses required for thermal activation which is the thermally activated mechanism assumed in the simulations the predictions deviate from the measurements for the arb nmm with nm the calculations assume no change in the thermally activated mechanism with and thus the discrepancy at nm is consistent with the notion that change in mechanism occurs at this length scale for the arb but not the pvd nmm specifically the arb and pvd nmm exhibit similar reductions in hardness with temperature above the critical layer thickness lcrit which can be attributed to classical thermally activated dislocation glide below lcrit however another thermally activated mechanism becomes predominant likely dislocation interface crossing which prevails when the stress to bow out dislocation segments within the nano layers exceeds the threshold stress for dislocation transmission across the interface our results on the arb nmm suggest that the interface crossing mechanism is accompanied by substantial drop in hardness with temperature the higher lcrit for arb than pvd can be explained as an interface effect and is in agreement with indirect evidence provided by recent md calculations suggesting that dislocation transmission across the arb interface is easier than across the pvd interface in summary we report on the effect of nanolayer thickness and interface structure on the high temperature mechanical behavior of two dimensional nanocomposite metallic multilayers our study reveals the existence of critical layer thickness lcrit at which the material is more resistant to softening by elevated temperatures we show for the first time that lcrit depends on interface structure which provides indirect evidence that lcrit corresponds to the layer thickness where the chief deformation mechanism transitions from intralayer slip to interface crossing these results imply that nano layer size and interface structure can be tuned to achieve optimal high temperature strengths in layered nanocomposite structures  a blended dye composed of five organic dyes namely rose bengal eosin rhodamine fast green and acridine orange was developed and tested for various solar cell parameters of zno based dye sensitized solar cell dssc comparison of the absorption spectra of dyes adsorbed on zno electrode revealed that the blended dye efficiently absorbs light in the entire visible region as compared with the individual dye six dsscs were fabricated

for harvesting of solar light during operation photons intercepted by the dye monolayer create excitons that are rapidly split at the nanoparticle surface with electrons injected into the nanoparticle film and holes leaving the opposite side of the device by means of redox species traditionally the i couple in liquid or solid state electrolyte two kinds of dyes namely metal organic complexes g ru complexes and metal free organic dyes have been widely used as sensitizers of dsscs organic dyes have several advantages as photosensitizers for dsscs larger absorption coefficients than metal complex photosensitizers variety in their structures provides possibilities for molecular design g the introduction of substituents and thus allows for easy control of their absorption spectra inexpensive because they do not contain noble metals like ruthenium this reduces the overall cost of the cell production in the existing dsscs the zno or tio films bond with just one kind of dye therefore the techniques to allow the films to absorb dyes of different colors would be breakthrough to increase the efficiency of dssc it will allow the solar cell to absorb and use broader spectrum of sunlight inakazu et al reported tio based liquid state dssc consisting of dye bilayer structure they reported that the layer by layer deposition of black and nk dyes results in an efficiency of individually black and nk dyes gave an efficiency of and respectively inspired by the formulation chemistry which deals with mixing the compounds substances that do not react with each other but produce mixture

an advantage to the finished product for particular application by changing the composition of the mixture its properties will change to be more or less suited to particular useful application there are various examples of formulation products such as adhesives antiperspirants cosmetics deodorants paints perfumes petroleum oil products etc five organic dyes which are commonly used to sensitize the semiconductor layer in dssc are rose bengal eosin rhodamine fast green and acridine orange having absorption peak at and nm respectively these dyes suffer from the fact that individually they absorb very small portion of the visible spectrum of solar radiations giving rise to low efficiency of dsscs since no single dye can perform efficiently in the entire visible spectrum the present work is focused on the development of dye having broadband absorption in the visible spectrum for efficient harvesting of light by dsscs the five dyes rose bengal eosin rhodamine acridine orange and fast

sensitized with various dyes was measured using shimadzu uv visible near infrared spectrophotometer solidspec current density voltage v curves were obtained by using computerized digital keithley source meter model and tungsten halogen lamp as the light source the lamp was calibrated close to am sun conditions from national physical laboratory npl new delhi the ir radiations were cut using water filter the performance of solar cell is quantified on macroscopic level with parameters such as open circuit voltage voc short circuit current jsc energy conversion efficiency and fill factor ff the parameters such as ideality factor and reverse saturation current jo have also been estimated the other two parameters are the series resistance rs and shunt resistance rsh in dssc rs is mainly attributed to the bulk resistance of semiconductor oxide films transparent conducting oxide electrode metallic contacts and electrolyte while rsh accounts for the leakage path across the dye oxide interface induced by defects in the bulk and at the surface of the oxide these parameters are determined using the v characteristics the values of and ff were evaluated using the following relations

visible absorption spectra of all six dyes rose bengal eosin c rhodamine c acridine orange fast green and blended dye c c in ethanol and adsorbed on zno electrode zno electrode sensitized with individual dyes was found to have one characteristic absorption peak while the zno electrode sensitized with blended dye c c was found to have three characteristic absorption peaks at and nm covering the entire visible region after the dye is adsorbed on the zno electrode its absorption spectra broadened slightly with redshift in the peak position except acridine orange compared to the absorbance spectra in ethanol it is further seen that the blended dye has much higher absorbance and covers broad visible region nm figure shows the v characteristics of the six dsscs sensitized with rose bengal and eosin c rhodamine c acridine orange fast green and blended dye c c under the same illumination conditions various cells were fabricated under identical conditions the solar cell parameters jsc voc ff rs rsh and jo are given in table it was found that when the solar cell was sensitized with the developed blended dye the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell improved to large extent as compared to the individual dye due to the broader coverage of the solar spectrum in individual form rose bengal was found to be the most successful dye it delivers jsc ma voc ff and the cell sensitized with rose bengal dye having five times concentration delivers jsc ma voc ff and this cell has low fill factor eosin c shows moderate performance and gives an efficiency of rhodamine c fast green and acridine orange show lower photovoltaic performances table it may be mentioned that each individual dye has narrow region for light absorption the solar cell having zno electrode sensitized with the blended dye c c shows the maximum photovoltaic performance of jsc ma voc ff and the cell reproducibility and consistency has been checked and maximum variation of in efficiency in case of blended dye has been observed the observed enhancement in the photovoltaic performance of the cell with blended dye can be attributed to the broad coverage of the visible spectra of solar radiations the values of rs and rsh for all the cells are also listed in table it is seen that there is not much effect on the value of rs and rsh the parameters such as ideality factor and reverse saturation current jo have also been estimated for the present cells and are given in table it is seen from the table that the value of is close to and the value of jo is very low for the cell fabricated using the developed blended dye in case of solar cells generally reduction in the value of jo results in the increase of voc due to enhancement in the charge separation at the oxide solution interface it is clear from table that in the present case of blended dye the voc has been increased these results very strongly indicate that the enhancement in the photovoltaic properties of the dssc prepared using the blended dye is due to the broad absorbance spectrum of the dye in the visible region besides the incident solar flux the principal fundamental factor that limits the short circuit current is the ipce which is expressed in terms of the lhe of the dye the quantum yield of electron injection inj and the efficiency of collecting the injected electrons cc at the transparent back contact given byipce lhe inj cc low ipce is the result of either inefficient light harvesting by the dye inefficient charge injection into zno or inefficient collection of injected electrons low lhe can be due to low dye absorption coefficient over the solar spectrum low dye concentration thin zno film to support large concentration of adsorbed dye which absorbs significant fraction of the incident light insufficient light scattering within the film absorption of light by zno or the redox electrolyte and dye degradation low inj can be due to dye desorption dye aggregation or the excited state levels of the dye lying below the conduction band edge of zno low cc is due to competition between fast recombination of photoinjected electrons with the redox electrolyte or oxidized dye and electron collection figure shows the ipce of all the six dsscs sensitized with individual and blended dyes rose bengal eosin c rhodamine c acridine orange fast green and blended dye c c a maximum ipce of at nm was observed for the blended dye the observed maximum in ipce is larger than the sum of ipce of the five dyes this is because the cells sensitized with blended dye have concentration ratio of c c of the individual dye acridine orange rose bengal eosin rhodamine and fast green whereas the cells sensitized with single dye have concentration ratio of only therefore the total effect in blended dye is not the sum of five dyes since the fabrication parameters of all the six cells were the same except the dye therefore inj and cc would remain constant and the changes in the ipce are only due to lhe of the dye hence the observed increase in the value of ipce by the use of blended dye ascertains the efficient light harvesting in the visible spectrum the examination of the data reveals that the efficiency of the acridine dye is and its ipce is also less than similarly fast green also exhibits very low efficiency and ipce thus three dye cosensitization is able to enhance the efficiency of the present system of dssc critical analysis of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data of individual and the blended dyes would be useful in understanding the molecular engineering of the blended dye in conclusion it was found that blended dye composed of rhodamine rose bengal and eosin in the proportion c exhibits efficient harvesting of light with strong and broad absorption in the visible spectrum nm enhancement in efficiency and ipce without affecting series and shunt resistances ascertains that the blended dye can be used very effectively for an efficient dssc this work may prove its worth in solar cell technology  designs for broadband chirped pulse fourier transform microwave cp ftmw spectrometer are presented the spectrometer is capable of measuring the ghz region of rotational spectrum in single data acquisition one design uses gsamples arbitrary waveform generator awg to produce s duration chirped pulse with linear frequency sweep of ghz this pulse is sent through microwave circuit to multiply the bandwidth of the pulse by factor of and upconvert it to the ghz range the chirped pulse is amplified by traveling wave tube amplifier and broadcast inside the spectrometer by using double ridge standard gain horn antenna the broadband molecular free induction decay fid is received by second horn antenna downconverted and digitized by gsamples ghz hardware bandwidth digital oscilloscope the second design uses simplified pulse generation and fid detection scheme employing current state of the art high speed digital electronics in this spectrometer chirped pulse with ghz of bandwidth is directly generated by using gsamples awg and upconverted in single step with an ultrabroadband mixer the amplified molecular emission is directly detected by using gsamples digital oscilloscope with ghz bandwidth in both designs fast fourier transform of the fid produces the frequency domain rotational spectrum in the ghz range the performance of the cp ftmw spectrometer is compared to balle flygare type cavity ftmw spectrometer the cp ftmw spectrometer produces an equal sensitivity spectrum with factor of reduction in measurement time and reduction in sample consumption by factor of the cp ftmw spectrometer also displays good intensity accuracy for both sample number density and rotational transition moment strategies to reduce the cp ftmw measurement time by another factor of while simultaneously reducing the sample consumption by factor of are demonstrated rotational spectroscopy is powerful structural tool in physical chemistry the relationship between the molecular structure and the rotational transition frequencies via the principal moments of inertia provides one of the most direct methods for structure determination of gas phase samples other effects in the rotational motion of molecules such as centrifugal distortion hyperfine spectral structure from quadrupolar nuclei and frequency shifts caused by tunneling motion provide further characterization of the molecular structure and low frequency vibrational motions the development of the microwave stark spectrometer by mcafee et al and hughes and wilson provided general tool to physical chemists studying molecular structure measurements employing this waveguide spectrometer design examined several important topics in molecular structure including the existence of stable conformations separated by low energy barriers and the tunneling dynamics of methyl group internal rotation however the need for sufficient vapor pressure in the waveguide cell limited the size range of molecules that could be interrogated by pure rotational spectroscopy period of major experimental advances culminated with the development of the molecular beam fabry rot fourier transform microwave ftmw spectrometer by balle and flygare in this spectrometer used time domain microwave spectroscopy to provide sensitive detection of the rotational free induction decay fid following polarization by short microwave pulse by performing spectroscopy in the time domain it became possible to achieve high frequency resolution without power broadening or the line shape distortion found in stark modulation spectrometers second crucial advantage of this new technique was the ability to use pulsed molecular beam sources this basic spectrometer design with important modifications to improve sensitivity and frequency resolution currently dominates the field of pure rotational spectroscopy the move to pulsed molecular beam sources has greatly expanded the range of molecular systems amenable to analysis by rotational spectroscopy the rapid cooling of molecules in seeded molecular beams makes it possible to study large molecules with complex conformational structure the molecular beam source can also stabilize weakly bound molecular clusters the evolution of pulsed molecular beam sources has led to the structural studies of radicals ions and their complexes the fabry rot ftmw spectrometer is narrowband spectrometer the use of cavity with high quality factor limits the measurable frequency bandwidth to less than mhz in most spectrometer designs the microwave cavity serves two functions it decreases the power requirements for the microwave polarizing pulse and enhances the amplitude of the fid emission signal often these spectrometers are called broadband to indicate that they operate over wide frequency range typically about ghz however the process of acquiring spectrum over the full operating range of the spectrometer is laborious the spectrum scanning process requires series of steps where the cavity is precisely tuned to resonance narrow frequency range is measured khz and the cavity is moved to its next position this process is automated in many existing spectrometer designs so that spectrum over frequency range of several gigahertz can be obtained without user intervention but the basic spectrometer design leads to long spectrum acquisition times for example on the cavity ftmw spectrometer in our laboratory based on the miniature ftmw design of suenram et al it takes about to acquire spectrum over an ghz range the spectrometer performs ten signal averages with khz frequency steps major contributor to the overall measurement time comes from the positioning of the cavity mirrors at each frequency step by using our automated mini ftmw spectrometer we find that the spectrometer is making measurements for less than half of the acquisition time the time consuming spectral acquisition process poses difficulties for using ftmw spectroscopy in analytical chemistry applications optimizing source conditions for previously unknown species and performing rotational spectroscopy of excited vibrational or electronic states prepared by laser excitation where long term laser frequency drift may occur we describe new approach to molecular beam ftmw spectroscopy that provides true broadband performance the spectrometer exploits recent advances in arbitrary waveform generators and broadband signal digitizers to perform time domain rotational spectroscopy over an ghz bandwidth for every signal acquisition event the key to the spectrometer operation is the ability to create phase reproducible chirped microwave pulse the chirped pulse duration is and produces an ghz linear frequency sweep to polarize the molecular sample in time that is short compared to the pure dephasing time of about the subsequent fid is digitized by using the high speed bit digitizer in digital oscilloscope all components in the spectrometer are fixed there are no parts that need to be controlled for operation this feature of the spectrometer makes it possible to implement strategies that produce significant reductions in the spectrum acquisition time while simultaneously reducing the sample consumption the chirped pulse ftmw cp ftmw spectrometer consists of three basic components chirped microwave pulse generation microwave excitation pulse and molecular beam sample interaction region and fid detection figure shows general schematic of the spectrometer two spectrometer designs will be discussed one uses additional microwave circuits to extend the capabilities of lower bandwidth arbitrary waveform generators awgs and digital oscilloscopes while the other simplified spectrometer design uses the current state of the art awgs and oscilloscopes to directly produce the excitation pulse and detect the broadband signal the operating principles of both designs are identical but their specific implementations differ chirped microwave to perform broadband ftmw spectroscopy we require microwave source that can produce phase reproducible linear frequency sweeps over an ghz frequency range in about sweep rates greater than mhz the short sweep durations are required so that the sample is polarized on time scale faster than the pure dephasing of the rotational fid in our ghz spectrometer the fid decays with gaussian profile in about time to reach half of the maximum amplitude and is dominated by doppler broadening in practice s pulse duration is chosen based on the specifications of the high power i diode used to protect the receiver components from the polarizing pulse the ability to average the fid signal in the time domain requires high phase stability of the microwave source all frequency sources in the experiment are phase locked to rb disciplined crystal oscillator operating at mhz stanford research systems fs the specified frequency accuracy of the mhz reference is and ultimately determines the accuracy of our microwave frequency measurements for signal averaging the broadband fid in the time domain the key feature of this clock is low phase noise dbc hz at hz all microwave sources used in either microwave pulse production or fid signal processing are harmonics of this mhz reference frequency ensuring that all light waves start with the same relative phase in each measurement event the first cp ftmw spectrometer design uses gsamples awg tektronix awg for chirped pulse generation the phase stability of the internal clock in the gsamples awg is insufficient for performing time domain signal averaging of the ghz bandwidth molecular emission signal therefore phase locked dielectric resonator oscillator pdro operating at ghz is used as an external clock for the awg the nyquist frequency range for the awg operating at gsamples is only ghz for this lower bandwidth awg we require bandwidth multiplication circuit to produce pulses covering ghz of bandwidth the microwave circuit shown in fig accomplishes two tasks it expands the sweep bandwidth by factor of and it upconverts the frequencies into the ghz frequency range full parts listing of the microwave circuit components can be found in the supplementary information bandwidth extension is performed by using active frequency multipliers these devices linearly increase the sweep bandwidth while maintaining the pulse duration this circuit was designed to use only single external microwave frequency and to permit simple filtering of the output of the frequency multipliers to improve the spectral purity of the final chirped pulse output the details of this design are described below we also note that both of the awgs used in this work have two independently programmable digital data channels we use one of these channels to provide trigger pulse to the digital oscilloscope to initiate data collection the other data channel provides pulse to digital pulse generator stanford research systems dg that provides ttl signals to control the molecular beam valve and the high power pulsed microwave amplifier we generate linear frequency sweep from to mhz from the gsamples awg that is the input pulse to the microwave circuit shown in fig the awg output is filtered with mhz low pass filter to remove spurious signals related to mixing of the waveform output and the ghz external clock of the waveform generator the first step in creating the microwave polarizing pulse is to upconvert the direct output of the awg into the microwave frequency range this step is accomplished by using broadband microwave mixer and pdro source operating at ghz the output of the mixer contains two linear sweep sidebands above and below the ghz carrier frequency to extend the bandwidth of the pulse by using microwave frequency multipliers it is necessary to isolate single side band we use pole microwave bandpass filter db points at and ghz and db attenuation at ghz to extract the lower sideband and to reject any residual microwave power at the ghz carrier frequency bandwidth extension of the linear frequency sweep occurs in two stages the bandwidth of the microwave pulse is first increased by factor of by using an active frequency quadrupler the output of the frequency quadrupler is filtered in high pass filter with ghz cutoff frequency to remove the residual power leakage and lower harmonics of the sweep that appear on the output of the quadrupler the frequency multiplied sweep is subsequently downconverted by ghz in broadband mixer the local oscillator for this mixer is provided by the frequency doubled output of the ghz pdro source the mixer output is amplified in broadband microwave amplifier ghz range with db gain and sent to an active frequency doubler to increase the sweep bandwidth by factor of overall after the two multiplier stages the output of this active doubler is directed to second high pass filter with ghz cutoff frequency finally the sweep is downconverted to the ghz range by using broadband mixer with the ghz signal as the local oscillator the final microwave pulse is preamplified in low noise solid state amplifier and sent through programmable attenuator before being directed to the input of high power microwave amplifier by following the initial calibration of this circuit it has operated without adjustment the final step of microwave pulse creation is amplification to high peak power for use in the experiments the power requirements for cp ftmw spectroscopy will be discussed in the next section we have used several microwave power amplifiers in our experiments including w solid state amplifier microwave power ghz and pulsed traveling wave tube amplifiers twtas with peak powers of either or kw amplifier research a or amplifier research tp ghz all of these amplifiers have demonstrated sufficient phase stability in successive pulses to permit time domain averaging of the fid the final linear frequency sweep microwave pulse generated by the gsamples awg and amplified by the kw twta is displayed in fig the top panel shows the pulse measured in the time domain by mixing sample of the amplifier output with single frequency microwave source at ghz in broadband mixer the frequency bandwidth of the pulse is demonstrated in the middle panel where the fourier transform of the time domain pulse is shown to characterize the chirp of the microwave pulse we have performed time frequency analysis of the pulse spectrogram by using moving window fourier transform method this analysis applies ns wide kaiser bessel window function of the data to select small time slice of the pulse the fourier transform of each time slice is represented in the bottom panel of fig this analysis method shows the linear frequency sweep of the microwave pulse and the signal purity at each instantaneous frequency the spurious signals in the pulses created with this technique are at least db lower in power than the instantaneous sweep frequency across the full ghz range of the pulse recent advances in high speed awgs have greatly simplified production of the chirped pulses gsamples awg tektronix awg is used to create chirped pulse with linear frequency sweep from mhzto ghz the actual output of the awg includes signals above ghz that come from the mixing of the primary pulse with the ghz sample clock this mixing produces an image sweep from to ghz we use this image signal to create chirped pulse with ghz of bandwidth by filtering the output of the gsamples awg with ghz low pass filter the awg pulse is upconverted in broadband mixer by using pdro at ghz to create the final chirped pulse covering the ghz region spectrograms of the chirped pulse output from the awg and the upconversion mixer are shown in fig ref to illustrate the pulse shape when part of the awg image sweep is included in the pulse this simple upconversion process has an important technical advantage the mixing process retains the dynamic range for the pulse shape amplitude of the pulse the awg has bit vertical resolution in contrast the use of active frequency multipliers in bandwidth extension circuit restricts the input power range where linear amplitude response is achieved to dynamic range of about the chirped pulses used in these measurements have flat amplitude profile and for these pulses the bandwidth extension circuit performs well however the bandwidth extension circuit will not be suitable for applications where amplitude shaping of the excitation pulse is required microwave excitation pulse and molecular beam the vacuum chamber design for cp ftmw spectrometer requires minimum of components the high power polarizing pulse is broadcast into the molecular beam interaction region by using wrd double ridge standard gain horn second gain horn is used to collect the molecular emission we have used two horn sets in the cp ftmw spectrometer amplifier research at and atm both of these designs have gains of dbi and have db beam widths of about across the operating frequency band the currently operating spectrometer uses the atm horns with separation of cm at this distance there is about db of transmission loss between the gain horns over the frequency range of the spectrometer ghz this wide separation permits multiple nozzle source operation and will be described below the current spectrometer has cm length iso cm diameter vacuum chamber with two in diffusion pumps varian vhs backed by mechanical pump roots blower combination edwards m and eh the high power polarizing pulse and molecular emission are coupled into and out of the chamber by using double ridge waveguide bulk heads with kapton windows atm to maintain vacuum all interior surfaces of the molecular beam chamber are covered by microwave foam absorber that is secured to metal foil backing emerson and cuming hr ml the microwave absorber is needed to prevent long lived resonances in the molecular beam chamber that produce spurious microwave contributions to the collected microwave signal the sample is introduced into the interaction region through the free jet expansion of pulsed solenoid valve general valve series the nozzle diameter is mm and the pulse duration is about molecular samples are typically gas mixtures in first run neon an mixture of neon and helium the nozzle backing pressure is typically atm specific conditions for each measurement are provided in the figure captions by following sample polarization by the high power chirped pulse there is broadband molecular emission or fid key component of the spectrometer is broadband low noise receiver to amplify the weak molecular emission this receiver shown schematically in fig and in more detail in fig contains low noise amplifier lna components to protect the lna from the high power polarization pulse and downconverter to transfer the ghz molecular signal to lower frequency for digitization the first two components in the detection assembly are high power i diode advanced control components aclm k and single pole switch advanced technical materials needed to protect the lna the i diode is rated for kw peak power with pulse duration of and has measured recovery time of ns the leakage peak power from the diode is still above the damage threshold for the lna so the microwave switch is placed after the diode this switch is controlled by the same ttl pulse that activates the high power amplifier pulse output combining these two devices add about db to the overall receiver noise figure through their insertion loss after passing through the diode and switch the rotational fid is amplified by high gain db low noise noise fig solid state broadband microwave amplifier miteq amf p we have used two digital oscilloscopes to digitize the broadband fid signal when the gsamples oscilloscope tektronix tds hardware bandwidth of ghz bit is used for detection the fid must be downconverted to the dc ghz frequency range this is accomplished by using an ultrabroadband triple balance mixer with pdro source at ghz as the local oscillator the downconverted fid signal passes through low pass filter ghz cutoff that removes the local oscillator signal that leaks through the mixer dc block mhz cutoff ghz pass band follows the low pass filter to remove noise prior to digitization downconversion does not appreciably affect the signal to noise ratio of the receiver because the noise figure is dominated by the lna and the protection devices that proceed it however there is significant overlap between the molecular emission band ghz and the downconversion band mhz ghz the finite isolation of the triple balance mixer produces image peaks in the spectrum at the level in the frequency overlap region ghz the frequencies of the images can be calculated from the measured spectrum and removed with postprocessing of the data continued advances in the digitization rates and hardware bandwidths of digital oscilloscopes have also produced simplification in the fid detection process the latest generation digital oscilloscope tektronix dpo offers gsamples digitization rates with hardware bandwidths up to ghz with digital signal processing enhancements we have used this oscilloscope to directly digitize the fid following the lna the lack of downconversion step in the fid detection removes the problem of image peaks in the spectrum for either oscilloscope data acquisition is initiated by pulse from the awg that is created on one of the two digital marker channels both oscilloscopes are phase locked to the mhz reference from the rb disciplined master clock to permit coherent averaging of the fid in the time domain the repetition rate of the experiment is currently limited by the data processing speeds of the oscilloscope when using the gsamples digital oscilloscope to digitize the downconverted fid for s duration point record length the repetition rate is limited to hz the latest gsamples digital oscilloscope shows speed improvement of factor of and can achieve repetition rate of hz when there is no digital signal processing data processing speeds of the digital oscilloscopes will continue to improve as the base computer platforms incorporate newer components the current repetition rate of hz for the gsamples digital oscilloscope is suitable for most rotational spectroscopy studies in particular many experiments use pulsed laser for sample creation in laser ablation source or molecular excitation and the spectrometer repetition rate is limited to hz by this device in all timing comparisons given in this work we assume that the cp ftmw spectrometer is running at hz repetition rate spectrometer three keys for optimal spectrometer performance are linear sweep excitation high microwave peak power and digital signal processing of the rotational fid the first two are necessary for optimal polarization of the molecular sample and the third improves the frequency resolution at baseline the description of the macroscopic polarization by using fast frequency sweep has been previously presented by mcgurk et al to describe experiments where the molecular resonance was swept through fixed microwave frequency by using the molecular stark effect in this work mcgurk et al pointed out that fast passage excitation is an efficient way to excite the molecular sample in later work wolf has demonstrated fast passage excitation by chirped millimeter pulses for rotational spectroscopy in this experiment chirped pulse covering mhz mhz in created by using backward wave oscillator bwo was used to sweep over the molecular transition of two ocs isotopomers in this measurement the sweep duration of the chirped pulse is slow compared to the time scale of the transient molecular emission the molecular rotational transition is detected through the heterodyne mixing of the fixed frequency molecular transient emission with the continuing linear frequency sweep of the bwo significant frequency determination uncertainty is associated with this measurement process more recently khodos et al have described improved methods to analyze the transient signals in an experiment where the sweep duration is slow compared to the molecular emission the important advance enabled by the new high speed awg technology is that it is now possible to perform broadband chirped pulse excitation in time scale shorter compared to the transient emission time in the cp ftmw spectrometer described here the chirped pulse excitation of the broadband spectrum is separated from the broadband detection of the fid as occurs for other fourier transform spectroscopy methods in their study of fast passage excitation by using the molecular stark shift mcgurk et al calculated the polarization of the molecular sample by linear frequency sweep by solving the bloch equations for single rotational transition the measurement of wolf supported the basic results of their work our measurements by using the cp ftmw spectrometer further confirm these results the electric field for chirped pulse that produces linear frequency sweep ise emaxei t where emax is the peak electric field of the pulse constant across the chirped pulse and the instantaneous frequency is inst ddt t the linear sweep rate is given by in the two previous expressions the sweep range for the pulse is linearly related to the pulse duration tpulse tpulse unlike simple transform limited pulses with single carrier frequency the chirped pulse provides separation of the bandwidth and the pulse duration this makes it possible to separately control the frequency range of the excitation and the amount of energy delivered to the sample for microwave spectroscopy the linear frequency sweep pulse has been shown by mcgurk et al to be particularly efficient at polarizing the molecular sample one of their main results is that the signal from chirped pulse excitation has the forms epulse where represents the frequency the transition dipole moment epulse the electric field strength and the population difference at equilibrium assumed to be unchanged by the pulse the weak pulse limit valid for high bandwidth measurements for all practical amplifier choices for chirped pulse excitation epulse is constant for all frequencies in the pulse and is fixed by the maximum peak power of the amplifier this result has been simplified from the form given by mcgurk et al because their analysis assumed that detection would be accomplished through heterodyne mixing of the emission and the polarizing pulse in our spectrometer as mentioned above the chirped pulse has duration shorter than the time and so molecular emission is directly detected in the absence of the polarizing pulse key aspect of eq is that the signal scales as for fixed pulse duration this means that the signals decrease with the square root of the bandwidth in contrast to the case of transform limited pulses where the signal linearly decreases with excitation bandwidth the difference in this scaling comes from the fact that for transform limited pulses increasing the bandwidth is achieved by decreasing the pulse duration and therefore decreasing the total energy delivered to the sample at fixed peak power by using the linear sweep chirped pulse the maximum amount of pulse energy limited by can be delivered to the sample for any excitation bandwidth to more clearly demonstrate the efficiency of chirped pulse excitation we have measured the pure rotational transition of propyne mhz with both chirped and transform limited polarizing pulses of varying bandwidths chirped pulses were created as previously described transform limited pulses were produced by mixing an awg generated gaussian profile with the output of microwave synthesizer tuned to resonance for all measurements in this test w solid state microwave amplifier was used to amplify the polarizing pulse single pole single throw spst switch was placed on the amplifier output to blank the noise power of the amplifier during fid detection this switch has an insertion loss of about db across the ghz frequency range and reduces the peak power of the chirped pulse with of peak power delivered to the sample the molecular rotational signal was optimal for mhz bandwidth chirped pulse or mhz bandwidth ns pulse duration gaussian pulse the results of these measurements are shown in fig this figure verifies the signal scaling predicted by eq it also illustrates the favorable signal scaling of the chirped pulse for large bandwidth measurements compared to transform limited pulse shapes we have also tested the sweep rate dependence of eq by fixing the bandwidth of the chirped pulse and varying the pulse duration these measurements not shown also display the signal dependence we also note that the maximum signal for the propyne transition is the same for optimal excitation by using either the chirped or transform limited pulse for cp ftmw spectroscopy the power requirements depend on the pulse properties bandwidth and duration and the molecular properties the magnitude of the dipole moment here we provide rough estimates of the power requirements in the cp ftmw spectrometer and these results are supported by our experience in operating the spectrometer for the past year in this discussion we do not explicitly include the rotational dependence of the transition dipole moment and simply classify molecules based on their total dipole moment the data in fig can be used for more detailed analysis of spectrometer performance relative to the balle flygare cavity ftmw spectrometer more peak power is required by the cp ftmw spectrometer in order to optimally polarize the sample for two reasons first the cp ftmw spectrometer lacks the passive amplification that the fabry rot cavity provides the peak power requirement inversely scales with the cavity the miniature cavity ftmw spectrometer in our laboratory has cavity on the order of therefore to optimally excite the same transition the cp ftmw spectrometer roughly requires factor of more power second while the cavity ftmw spectrometer approximately covers mhz of bandwidth with each microwave pulse the cp ftmw spectrometer covers ghz this results in approximately another factor of power requirement the cavity ftmw spectrometer in our laboratory requires on the order of of peak input power intracavity power to optimally excite molecules with d dipole moment therefore the cp ftmw spectrometer should require on the order of kw to optimally excite the same transition by using an ghz sweep of the same pulse duration in practice we find that s ghz pulse from the kw twta can optimally excite most molecules with dipole moments greater than one new issue in cp ftmw spectroscopy is signal leakage in the frequency domain spectrum with the large dynamic range of the cp ftmw measurements the frequency domain side lobes of strong rotational transitions can cover large spectral region near baseline these large side lobes can make it difficult to observe weak rotational transitions with frequencies close to strong transition situation commonly encountered when measuring the rotational spectrum of isotopomers in low natural abundance for example the rotational transitions of isotopes of large molecules have small frequency shifts from the transitions of the dominant normal species in the broadband spectrometer where there is no cavity to provide frequency filtering it is necessary to perform signal processing of the fid to improve the baseline resolution of transitions separated by small frequencies several time domain filters exist that provide trade off between signal leakage side lobe suppression and resolution defined as the line width at fwhm in fig we show the frequency domain spectrum of cyclopropylacetylene following the application of several standard filters to the rotational fid signal in this spectrum the transition of c isotopomer mhz is located near the transition of the normal species mhz this figure shows that side lobe suppression significantly reduces the spectrometer linewidth at baseline making it easier to detect weak transitions in the proximity of strong ones we employ kaiser bessel window function db of side lobe suppression and increase in the fwhm linewidth in the broadband rotational spectra reported in this paper in this section we illustrate the dynamic range and sensitivity of the cp ftmw spectrometer we also compare the cp ftmw spectrometer performance to that of miniature balle flygare cavity ftmw spectrometer in our laboratory the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of ocs dissolved in mixture of neon and helium shown in fig is used to illustrate the dynamic range of the current state of the art gsamples awg and gsamples oscilloscope cp ftmw spectrometer after the acquisition of single fid the signal to noise ratio for the transition of the normal species is and the transition of the cs species is easily observed in natural abundance fig left panel after time domain averages of the broadband fid the signal to noise ratio for the normal species transition has grown to and now the oc transition is observed in natural abundance fig right panel with this shot measurement the lowest abundance isotopomer we observe is c natural abundance these results as well as comparable results obtained with the bandwidth extended gsamples awg and gsamples oscilloscope cp ftmw spectrometer are given in table which lists the measured frequencies and relative intensities for the transition of all observed ocs isotopomers expanded spectral regions showing the intensity accuracy of the direct detect spectrometer after time domain averages of the fid can be found in fig these measured values are compared to the frequencies obtained by cavity ftmw spectroscopy by suenram et al at nist refs and and to the calculated relative intensities based on natural abundance we do not correct for the isotopic variation of the dipole moment these comparisons indicate that the cp ftmw frequency measurements are within about khz of the nist measurements the relative intensities over dynamic range of are obtained within about the cp ftmw spectrometer is also capable of measuring accurate relative intensities due to variations of the transition strength of the oscillator in fig the cp ftmw rotational spectrum of tetrafluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether also known by its trade names of suprane or desflurane over signal averages is plotted versus spectral simulation by using predicted frequencies and intensities from pickett spcat program the prediction is generated by using previously measured rotational constants mhz mhz mhz and dipole moment components d d d in this case the component of the dipole moment is approximately six times weaker than the component since the transition intensity scales with in the weak pulse limit eq the type transitions are on the order of times weaker than the type transitions note that below ghz the intensities of the rotational spectrum are in excellent agreement with the predicted intensities at high frequencies we notice that the cp ftmw measured intensities become progressively lower than predicted we attribute this effect to poor coupling efficiency of the horn antenna above ghz and to power droop in the twta since the cp ftmw spectrometer measures the entire ghz range of the spectrum in every valve pulse the sensitivity of the spectrometer is an adjustable parameter the time jitter between successive signal acquisitions is sufficiently low that averaging the fids in the time domain is possible with minimal signal loss over averages the advantage to making broadband measurement is that only one has to measure the spectrum until an adequate signal to noise ratio is achieved this is in contrast to narrow band spectrometer where the entire spectrum must be measured at high sensitivity which is time consuming even without signal averaging the flexible measurement time of the spectrometer is highlighted in fig where the rotational spectrum of suprane is shown after single valve pulse using single microwave polarizing pulse and collecting single fid signal averages and signal averages after single valve pulse many intense lines of the spectrum are evident after signal averages requiring less than of acquisition time spectrum with sufficient signal to noise ratio approximately on the most intense transitions in the spectrum for many applications is achieved comparison to balle flygare cavity ftmw we have performed side by side comparison of the cp ftmw spectrometer to the miniature balle flygare cavity ftmw spectrometer in our laboratory we choose the mini ftmw spectrometer because its smaller microwave beam waist is compatible with laser excitation experiments the main application of cp ftmw spectroscopy in our laboratory after performing comparisons on number of molecular systems we estimate that the cp ftmw spectrometer matches the sensitivity of this cavity ftmw spectrometer after signal averages or min at hz repetition rate for these comparisons the mini ftmw was set to acquire ten signal averages with khz frequency steps resulting in total valve shots for an ghz spectrum the cp ftmw performance represents significant decrease in measurement time compared to the cavity ftmw spectrometer by using the settings stated above comparison of the rotational spectrum of cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde as measured by the cp ftmw spectrometer using signal averages and the balle flygare cavity ftmw spectrometer using ten signal averages per step khz frequency steps is shown in fig the cavity ftmw spectrum intensity has been scaled so that the noise levels of the two spectra are approximately equal number of transitions of low abundance isotopomers are labeled in the figure these signal levels are approximately equal in the two spectra methods to decrease the measurement the basic cp ftmw spectrometer design is capable of acquiring full rotational spectra approximately factor of more quickly than the balle flygare cavity ftmw spectrometer and furthermore the accurate intensity information in the cp ftmw spectra can be used to aid spectral assignments nevertheless there are still avenues for improvement of the spectrometer performance we will briefly discuss two approaches to increasing the spectrometer sensitivity or alternatively decreasing the measurement time and sample consumption necessary to reach target sensitivity level the first of these approaches makes use of multiple pulsed valve nozzles to exploit the coherent emitter effect after polarization the emitted power from the sample scales as where is the number of emitters in ftmw spectroscopy the emitted field rather than the emitted power is detected and so the signal linearly increases with the number of emitters however because the signal to noise ratio only scales as the square root of the number of averages this linear scaling offers tremendous advantage as an example consider the performance of one nozzle and of three nozzle system the threefold higher signal in the three nozzle system means that nine fids of the one nozzle system need to be averaged in order to match the signal to noise ratio of spectrum obtained from single fid of the three nozzle system in addition to reducing the measurement time by factor of the three nozzle system has also reduced the overall sample consumption by factor of these advantages are shown more clearly in fig where the relative performances of one two and three nozzle system are demonstrated for portion of the pure rotational spectrum of suprane the wrd gain horn broadcast and receive geometry show no decline in performance for separation distances of although we have used three nozzle system for illustration larger number of sources can be accommodated in the open interaction region of the cp ftmw spectrometer to provide further performance gains the ultimate design limits need to balance the added complexity and the addition vacuum pumping requirements of multinozzle experimental setup with the sensitivity gains second independent approach to improving spectrometer sensitivity is to collect more than one fid during the valve pulse we have been able to acquire as many as ten fids in one valve pulse by using feature of the digital oscilloscope which segments the digitizer memory and allows multiple short records to be spliced into single long record figure shows the results of this multi fid operation mode used with three nozzle system the number of fids that can be acquired is determined by the amount of high speed memory in the digital oscilloscope and sets our current limit to ten events upgrades to increase the memory depth by factor of are available shots of single nozzle single fid per pulse system are required to match the signal to noise ratio of three nozzle system in multi fid mode the combination of these approaches produces fold reduction in measurement time and fold reduction in sample consumption the bottom panels of fig show that the spectra of the first fifth and tenth fid acquisition in our three nozzle example have similar signal levels suggesting that more fid acquisitions per valve pulse are possible two designs for broadband cp ftmw spectrometer capable of measuring an ghz ghz frequency range in each fid have been presented the first cp ftmw spectrometer design uses microwave circuits to extend the bandwidth of lower sample rate awgs and uses broadband downconversion of the fid to move the molecular emission into detection band that matches the hardware frequency limits of the digital oscilloscope both of these strategies can be use to create broadband cp ftmw spectrometer that uses lower cost high speed digital electronics the second design uses the current state of the art digital electronics to simplify the experimental design other than microwave amplifiers this spectrometer requires only single frequency upconversion stage to move the chirped pulse sweep frequencies into the ghz microwave range continued advances in technology will eventually make it possible to build direct digital spectrometer where the excitation pulse is directly created by the awg and the molecular emission is directly digitized for frequencies up to ghz the ability to directly measure the fid is demonstrated in this work direct digital design where the user has complete control over the excitation pulse properties promises to provide rich development platform for broadband double resonance spectroscopy techniques that build off developments in two dimensional nmr spectroscopy we have demonstrated several benefits of performing broadband ftmw spectroscopy perhaps the biggest advantage of the cp ftmw spectrometer is the reduction in measurement time required to obtain broadband spectrum as shown in fig broadband spectrum can often be obtained in small number of data acquisition events although additional averaging is usually desired to improve sensitivity this performance characteristic can be exploited to make it easier to optimize source conditions for the production of novel molecular species in many cases source optimization can be achieved by using lower bandwidth spectrometer designs such as the search accelerated correct intensity method recently introduced by grubbs et al the ability to obtain accurate intensity information for both number density table and transition moment fig can reduce the time required to analyze molecular rotational spectra especially when graphical analysis programs are used finally the lack of components that require mechanical adjustment is significant advantage over cavity ftmw spectrometers the cp ftmw spectrometer has no measurement dead time so that improved data collection methods directly reduce the measurement time by using single nozzle source and acquiring single fid the cp ftmw spectrometer acquires the broadband ghz spectrum about times faster than cavity ftmw spectrometer while consuming times less sample we have demonstrated two approaches to decrease the measurement time another factor of while decreasing sample consumption an additional factor of larger gains may be possible by extending the multinozzle source and multi fid acquisition approaches beyond the design parameters we have presented the cumulative effect of the improved performance of the cp ftmw spectrometer in these areas suggests that it will be possible to perform structure determination by molecular rotational spectroscopy on vastly expanded range of molecular systems  perovskite solar cells are emerging as serious candidates for thin film photovoltaics with power conversion efficiencies already exceeding devices based on planar heterojunction architecture where the mapbi perovskite film is simply sandwiched between two charge selective extraction contacts can be processed at low temperatures making them particularly attractive for tandem and flexible applications however in this configuration the perovskite crystals formed are more or less randomly oriented on the surface our results show that by increasing the conversion step temperature from room temperature to the perovskite crystal orientation on the substrate can be controlled we find that films with preferential orientation of the long axis of the tetragonal unit cell parallel to the substrate achieve the highest short circuit currents and correspondingly the highest photovoltaic performance perovskite solar cells are emerging as promising candidates for thin film photovoltaics with power conversion efficiencies already approaching other established inorganic thin film technologies these devices can be processed easily from solution do not require high temperature sintering steps and can be prepared on flexible substrates while achieving high photovoltaic performance to date values of up to were reached via different fabrication techniques and achieving higher performances of up to could be feasible in the short term methylammonium lead iodide mapbi perovskites were initially introduced to photovoltaics in iodine iodide electrolyte based sensitized solar cells by miyasaka and co workers with starting efficiency of however these devices were highly unstable due to the degradation of the perovskite film by the electrolyte it was not until the introduction of meso superstructured perovskite solar cells by snaith and co workers that performances of over were achieved with the solid state hole transporter tetrakis n di methoxyphenylamine spirobifluorene spiro ometad hybrid perovskite solar cells can now achieve high power conversion efficiencies of over when processed as thin film photovoltaic devices and over in sensitized photoanode configuration the former architecture is particularly attractive for flexible and tandem applications which are compatible with low temperature processing compared to employing mesoporous tio photoanode which requires heating step at the fabrication protocol for state of the art planar heterojunction devices is based on sequential deposition conversion technique first introduced by liang and co workers and later applied to perovskite solar cells by burschka and co workers first film of pbi is deposited either via evaporation or solution processing onto non porous metal oxide layer the substrate is then immersed in solution containing an alkyl ammonium salt where the conversion into the perovskite phase takes place following this approach liu and co workers obtained perovskite crystals ranging in size from tens to hundreds of nanometers and complete surface area coverage in all previous work employing this technique the neat mapbi perovskite has been used in planar configuration devices this choice limits the maximum possible short circuit currents as the charge diffusion lengths have been determined to be around nm we have recently extended this technique to include chloride in the perovskite film formation thus achieving higher short circuit photocurrents due to the longer charge diffusion lengths present in this system approaching the micron scale here we further study the deposition conversion technique for planar heterojunction solar cells we show that it is critical to reach full perovskite conversion in order to achieve maximum performance and high short circuit currents we also show that the perovskite crystal orientation can be modified by the temperature of the immersion solution and find that high degree of oriented crystals is necessary for efficient operation the device architecture for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells used in this study is composed of fto tio mapbi spiro ometad au as shown in the schematic in figure the tio layer is non porous and acts as the electron selective contact while spiro ometad is used as the hole collecting contact the perovskite film was deposited via two step deposition conversion process where layer of pbi was first deposited via spin coating followed by conversion to the perovskite phase in second step via immersion in solution of methylammonium iodide and chloride in isopropanol at varying temperatures full experimental details can be found in the supplementary material in order to monitor the conversion of the pbi phase into the perovskite phase ray diffraction xrd measurements for increasing immersion times were performed see figure in the supplementary material the peak observed at corresponds to the reflection of pbi and the peak at corresponds to the first reflection of the perovskite phase by following the evolution of these two peaks we determined at which point full conversion was achieved which depended both on temperature and lead iodide film thickness the evolution of the film with time after this point can be seen in the scanning electron microscope sem images of figures a c in the supplementary material showing the increase of the crystal size with longer immersion times however gaps start appearing in the films at longer immersion times full area coverage is essential for optimum device performance therefore the conversion was stopped when no crystalline lead iodide was left in the film the shortest time with no residual lead iodide peak at approximately was chosen for further experiments and is summarized in table in the supplementary material for range of lead iodide thicknesses and immersion temperatures in figure we show the photovoltaic performance of devices that have been fabricated from lead iodide films immersed for range of times in the perovskite conversion solution we find that full conversion of the lead iodide film is essential for good device performance films which are not fully converted do not sustain the current at short circuit conditions even when scanning from open circuit to short circuit this anomalous behavior has been observed previously for this family of materials and is currently under intensive investigation by several research groups as the conversion occurs from the top of the lead iodide layer downwards the methylammonium ma cation requires certain amount of time at given temperature to diffuse through the whole structure it is likely that the residual lead iodide layer in films that are not fully converted inhibits charge transfer from the perovskite to the tio underlayer as electrons are required to travel upwards in energy to cross this interface we note here that fully converted films while showing standard jv curve shapes for solar cells when scanned with mv steps and ms delay times show different behavior when scanning from past open circuit to short circuit than on the reverse scan we show these results in figure in the supplementary material where hysteresis can be observed at these scan rates when these solar cells are held at short circuit conditions for extended periods of time the short circuit current drops to less than half its value in under half minute solar cells fabricated from perovskite films that are not fully converted to mapbi are an extreme example of this behavior where the current drops even while scanning the jv curve as shown in figure this may be due to residual interfacial lead iodide layer between tio and the perovskite crystals which could still be present even when the crystalline lead iodide signal disappears from the xrd measurements longer immersion times however did not solve this issue where devices immersed for min still showed hysteretic behavior and far lower photovoltaic performance it is worth noting here that this anomalous hysteretic effect to lesser extent is also present when the same sequential deposition conversion technique is applied to lead iodide layers within mesoporous tio film other parameters that affect film formation including both initial pbi layer thickness and conversion solution temperature were also studied the highest power conversion efficiencies of up to were achieved with lead iodide layer thicknesses between and nm and an immersion temperature of see table in the supplementary material for details summary of photovoltaic parameters for the best performing devices can be found in table in the supplementary material interestingly it was found that the immersion temperature did not significantly influence the average perovskite crystal size when the conversion was stopped at the minimum time possible after full conversion of the lead iodide layer see figure in the supplementary material this may be due to the perovskite tio layer interface interaction in previous study eperon et al have shown that the interaction between the tio layer and the perovskite film determines the film formation properties e surface coverage and crystal size as the films in this work all employed the same tio layer this may be the reason why perovskite crystal size is independent of the immersion temperature we note here that when the samples are prepared on plain glass big differences between samples converted at and at appear where the crystal size more than doubles at the higher temperature the photovoltaic performance of the best devices prepared from perovskite films converted at and is shown in figure both devices exhibited similar fill factors of around and similar open circuit voltages however devices fabricated at lower temperatures exhibit much lower short circuit currents than those fabricated at higher temperatures at the short circuit current approaches ma cm while at this value exceeds ma cm correspondingly the device efficiency for is the highest for this set of experiments standing at additionally we show histogram depicting the distribution of short circuit currents for set of over devices figure we can clearly observe that devices fabricated at lower temperatures have much larger spread in the final short circuit current with mean value of ma cm when the perovskite films are converted at however the short circuit currents are far more reproducible where more than third of the fabricated devices exhibit values of over ma cm to further examine the differences in short circuit current the light absorption characteristics of the films were quantified as shown in figure in the supplementary material we observed no difference in the absorption for any of the fabricated perovskite films this should be expected as the films are fabricated from the same thickness of pbi and neither the crystal size nor the surface coverage changes with different immersion temperatures to obtain better understanding of the influence of different immersion temperatures on the perovskite film growth xrd measurements were performed as shown in figure in all cases the perovskite structure is tetragonal in the mcm space group with no apparent difference in crystal size or crystallinity however with increasing immersion solution temperature higher proportion of oriented crystals was found the intensity of the and reflections increases with increasing temperature while the reflection completely disappears at higher temperatures and the other intensities remain the same this leads us to conclude that at higher immersion solution temperatures the crystals are preferentially oriented with the long axis parallel to the substrate it is curious to note here that high performing perovskite solar cells prepared from spincoating precursor mixture of mai and pbcl with subsequent heat treatment also result in highly oriented crystals with the long axis preferentially oriented parallel to the substrate where usually only the etc reflections are visible anisotropic electronic properties of the perovskite crystals may thus be the reason for the observed difference in photovoltaic performance further evidence to support this hypothesis is provided in recent study by saliba et al where flash annealing at of spin coated perovskite precursor mixtures was employed the resulting perovskite films exhibited larger and more oriented domains than films processed at for longer periods of time and higher short circuit currents than the standard counterparts while maintaining similar fill factors and open circuit voltages while in the study of saliba et al the increase in short circuit current was correlated with the formation of larger crystal domain sizes this is not the case in the study presented here the fact that we have obtained such similar result in this very different system points towards crystal orientation as key parameter determining the device short circuit current whether this is the result of anisotropic transport or specific interactions between the different charge extraction layers and the perovskite crystal planes is not clear at this point and is currently under investigation regardless of the specific mechanism however it is clear that controlling the deposition parameters to achieve highly oriented crystal domains is an important route towards the further development of this family of materials in conclusion the performance of planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells prepared by deposition conversion technique was studied by varying the conversion conditions our results show that the final perovskite crystal size is invariant with immersion temperature when the films are prepared on similar device substrates we postulate here that the morphology of the perovskite film is determined to large extent by the substrate perovskite interaction this is similar to findings for precursor mixture perovskite deposition in the case of lead iodide films that have not been fully converted into the methylammonium lead iodide phase the resulting devices do not sustain high currents at short circuit conditions even when scanned from open circuit to short circuit additionally we have found that the temperature for the conversion process is an important factor for device performance with increasing immersion temperatures for the perovskite conversion we observe higher short circuit currents in the resulting solar cells as well as much narrower performance spread when large batch of devices is considered the highest power conversion efficiency of is found for devices prepared from perovskite films immersed at the temperature of the conversion bath greatly influences the orientation of the resulting perovskite crystals which results in the preferential alignment of the long crystalline axis with the tio covered fto substrate thus orienting the planes perpendicular to the substrate our results illustrate the great importance of the solution deposition parameters during the formation of methylammonium lead iodide thin films we suggest that achieving highly oriented crystal domains is key factor for the further development of this promising family of materials for photovoltaic applications
