R Programming Test
==================

Automatic recognition of outage in production

There is a machine learning based system in production. It outputs a probablity score. An outage in one of the modules of the system resulted in deviation of the output score.

Write an R function which recognizes the start and end time of the outage with precision up to 1 hour.

Input: time series based data where each number (i.e. score value) is associated with a time point - data.csv.
Output: start and end time of the outage
